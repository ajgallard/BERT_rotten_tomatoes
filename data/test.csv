1,Rotten,"At some point in Shutter you will probably lose count, along with your patience, but the film will keep right on going."
0,Fresh,Very well done with a different kind of Batman than I am used to seeing
0,Fresh,"So bewitching as a romantic, charged & aesthetically slick star vehicle that it's easy to overlook its shakier aspects. Has adult summer blockbuster written all over it."
1,Rotten,"With the sensibility of a very boring Downton Abbey and a political consciousness to match, The Young Marx is an insipid disaster."
0,Fresh,One of the year's best films.
0,Fresh,The answer to the question of 'What if the people behind Top Gear did a Mission Impossible film?'
0,Fresh,A delightful three-way cast gel seamlessly.
1,Rotten,"It may have a nice view, but this is one house with a decidedly shoddy foundation."
1,Rotten,"McGregor catches the elegiac grandeur of Philip Roth's 1997 novel but filters out its bitter irony, historical sweep, and psychological complexity."
0,Fresh,A strong central performance.
0,Fresh,"Nicolas Pesce's impressive, highly original horror fable is the stuff of very beautiful nightmares."
0,Fresh,"Kutcher is slowly and surely punking America! On marginal talent and lots of luck, Kutcher is reaching the top on a mile-high pile of US Weekly cover photos."
0,Fresh,"Like a good soldier, it does get the job done and in an efficient -- some would say simplistic -- way."
0,Fresh,Just enough depth of character and place that it's smarter than your average paranormal flick.
0,Fresh,"It is a subtle, beautifully filmed, inventively structured portrait of a crumbling marriage and the lengths people will go to in order to save something that can't be saved."
1,Rotten,"Overall, it's ridiculous, but Cocktail is a real classic of the late-80s self-help moviemaking genre."
0,Fresh,"J. Edgar connects with viewers on an emotional level, charting the man's complicated love affairs-with his mother, his secretary, his deputy and his country."
1,Rotten,Devilishly sleazy.
0,Fresh,"Directed by and starring Streisant, this is a charming gender-bending fable, too bad the music is so undistinguished."
1,Rotten,"Torço apenas para que Shyamalan anuncie sua aposentadoria e, com isso, se poupe de mais embaraços e pare de destruir seu já frágil legado."
1,Rotten,"Despite the fact that Salome's Last Dance encompasses almost the entire text of a play by Wilde, it seems shapeless and without purpose."
1,Rotten,This is a film in which a goth from beyond the grave exacts revenge for being unfriended by-are you sitting down?-making her victim less popular on Facebook. The horror!
0,Fresh,"Now that Neeson has turned the mad-dad genre into a familiar blueprint of grimaces and cathartic violence, it's good to see one draw much of its tautness from tracking whether Canet's Julien is more likely to endanger himself than to locate his son."
1,Rotten,With its splashes of color and breakneck action it will easily distract for an hour and a half. But it offers little mystery or better humor to snack on.
0,Fresh,"A truly biting satire, full of gut punches and belly laughs."
1,Rotten,We've got somewhat entertaining trash here.
0,Fresh,"Cutting, provocative, introspective and wickedly astute, the elegant art-house melodrama juxtaposes beauty with the ugliness of the institution [of marriage]."
1,Rotten,"In its comfy material trappings and minor-note concerns, ""The Story of Us,"" seems to be less about the universal ""us"" than about one pair of well- to-do, self-involved yuppies with an overblown sense of entitlement to the perfect life."
0,Fresh,An emotionally searing look at the ways we hurt the ones we love and the ones we have come to hate.
0,Fresh,It'll be interesting to see if Willis can keep up the good acting.
1,Rotten,Klein's script is at once too airy-fairy and pandering to deliver the charm.
0,Fresh,"Whether informed audiences will learn something new here is debatable. Instead, the directors seem more interested in refocusing attention on the subject of the existence of Guantanamo in general."
0,Fresh,Better than you'd think.
0,Fresh,...Kazan achieves a sort of theatrical intensity in which the sweaty realism sometimes clashes awkwardly with the stylisation that heightens the dialogue into a kind of poetry.
0,Fresh,"Necessary Roughness has the right kind of rambunctious spirit for this kind of picture -- even if it's not quite as inventive as similar movies like the recent baseball send-up, Major League."
1,Rotten,"It would be lovely for Hollywood to tackle married relationships in a frank and funny manner, exploring where technology fits in and reinforcing the notion that monogamy can be sexy and exciting too. Unfortunately, ""Sex Tape"" isn't that movie."
1,Rotten,"Effectively acts as an animated ode to heteronormativity, toxic masculinity and patriarchal worldviews, passed off as harmless plot points to entertain young audiences."
1,Rotten,"Being a period piece hardly excuses Starsky & Hutch from being a cliche-ridden, uncharming and tiresome exercise in recycled humor."
1,Rotten,"The film takes a decent premise and, appropriately, drowns it in clumsy exposition and truly horrendous dialogue."
0,Fresh,"A seriously crushing, irresistible force of a movie."
0,Fresh,It's a perfectly standard adequate satisfying biopic about a very unique man.
0,Fresh,"[Mansfield Park] is a smart hybrid: part novel adaptation, part biography. It's now a period saga overlaid with a modern sensibility."
0,Fresh,"Hilarious dialogue and timing, more fun than a bong full of Jack Herer."
0,Fresh,Severed-head- and-shoulders above the spate of recent shockers.
0,Fresh,A rounded portrait of the Father of Yoga in the West that celebrates his practical and uplifting art of spiritual living.
0,Fresh,An excellent feature filled with valor. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"An extraordinary true story makes for a smart, adult, thrilling movie."
0,Fresh,Roberta Grossman's film is an ungainly hybrid of straight-up documentary and ingenuous re-enactment.
0,Fresh,It's a movie fans of nostalgic science fiction should really enjoy.
1,Rotten,"'The conventionality and predictability of every scene, the lame puns, the absence of comic rhythm, the fart jokes butt-ending the film--all was sly metafilmic parody of the sheer banality and crassness of so much present-day film comedy, yes?' (Silence.)"
1,Rotten,"What seems meant as a scorching indictment of American injustice and prejudice, or perhaps the searing character study of a cornered man, just ends up looking wishy-washy and old-fashioned."
0,Fresh,"""Rubber"" has anthropomorphic, head-scratching fun with its gory B-movie trappings, silly music cues, self-referential comedy and deliberately off-kilter acting."
1,Rotten,"I know director Gareth Edwards has a cult following stemming from his low-budget ""Monsters,"" but how can you unleash monsters on Vegas and Frisco, and have zero fun with it?"
0,Fresh,Sneakily compelling ...
0,Fresh,"Hints about America's future under Bush may theoretically be unearthed in Great Britain's past, or at least the past as catalogued by Mike Leigh in his latest gem."
0,Fresh,It keeps you on your toes from the moment it starts...
1,Rotten,This is Marvel imitation at its most tedious.
0,Fresh,"The sheer assaultive power of Goodbye to Language makes it Godard's most vibrant and exciting film for some time and, you might say, his most terroristic."
1,Rotten,"plenty watchable, though hardly scary"
0,Fresh,"The Prestige offers entertainment and wonderment unlike anything else currently in theatres, and that might be Nolan's greatest magic trick of them all."
0,Fresh,It's easy to recommend The Change-Up for its over-the-top laughs and a pair of solid leads that succeed in offering a raunchy twist on a familiar formula.
1,Rotten,"The main problem with A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop has less to do with its fidelity to the Coen brothers' 1984 original than with director Zhang Yimou's own incompatibility with the material."
0,Fresh,"An elegant, absorbing and stimulating experience."
1,Rotten,Russo-Young loses her way in charming jokes and exaggerated dialogues. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,Deceptively hidden beneath the jokes and the novel premise is a surprisingly convincing view of modern community.
0,Fresh,Nearly perfect. So much fun. A horror movie that I will 100 percent watch again.
0,Fresh,"Rocketman, like its main actor, is vibrant. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"It's funny, touching, perceptive and one of the great undiscovered movies. Discover it."
0,Fresh,Vin Diesel was excellent.
1,Rotten,"Disney stories often evoke powerful emotions, but this ""Dumbo"" is more glum than endearing with not enough heart and humor to ever achieve liftoff."
0,Fresh,"Tag manages to pack an emotional resonance, without tethering much into 'bro' territory."
0,Fresh,"The way Cuarón accumulates details-the jumble of clothes drying on a roof, a broken jug after a New Year's toast, the ubiquity of the Jesus Christ Superstar soundtrack in 1971-builds an elemental power."
0,Fresh,The film unspools as both a semi-musical comedy and as a light-hearted revenge lark about the sport of one-upmanship.
1,Rotten,Well-meaning but forgettable.
0,Fresh,The writing builds you up to such a point...I don't remember a spot where I wasn't intrigued the whole time.
1,Rotten,The humor is forced and the absurdist elements overwhelm the realism.
0,Fresh,At once a celebration of an iconic star's courageous last stand and a cautionary tale about a brilliantly talented young girl whose childhood was stolen by an industry that eventually abandoned her.
0,Fresh,The new story sees some rebellious creatures coming out from their underworld to attack humans. Watching Hellboy physically sorting them out is terrific fun.
0,Fresh,The Butler is an inspiring and important summation of the black struggle.
1,Rotten,Film works very hard to have her make sense [but] the more comedic flares and backstory details. . .the less she jells. . .Her arc isn't completely convincing.
1,Rotten,"The folks on the Starship Enterprise are never stodgier than when they try to 'loosen up' and play it for laughs, as they do often in Nemesis."
1,Rotten,The outcome is shrug-worthy rather than shocking.
1,Rotten,"As engineered by director David Swift, the film's cardinal error is its lack of restraint."
0,Fresh,It's a stimulating movie that provokes thought and emotion in perfect cadence.
0,Fresh,Geezer G-Men gone wild!
0,Fresh,"If you're looking for a rapturously funny film with a crackerjack cast, Game Night's a winner."
1,Rotten,Aaliyah's performance isn't much -- her hips and the costume do most of the work -- but there is a definite movie-star presence there.
0,Fresh,"There's enough boxing footage, of course, to satisfy avid fans of the sport, but the brothers' personal history is the real attraction here, with its fascinating revelations about their homeland and culture."
1,Rotten,"Although I had fun, this franchise has overstayed its welcome."
1,Rotten,A muddled teenpic.
0,Fresh,"In terms of both its global locales and cast, few movies have been as riveting in their exploration of the friend/enemy relationship between China and the U.S."
0,Fresh,The jokes rarely miss and the result is a refreshingly sardonic fairy tale.
0,Fresh,"While ""Disconnect"" may not offer anything new to the argument against the overuse of technology, it remains a well-made film with strong performances from the entire cast."
0,Fresh,"The film's densely constructed trial sequences are freighted with rich detail, unexpected turns and intimate insights into the criminal justice system."
0,Fresh,"A nerve-beating masterpiece, and more timely now than then."
1,Rotten,"It's all loosely assembled, with less of an eye toward storytelling and more of a rambling ""and then Mahalia Jackson came along"" approach."
0,Fresh,"The film has a few horrific jolts and plenty of violence, but at its core it is simply a mind-twisting head trip."
0,Fresh,Shaun the Sheep Movie proves silence can be golden if the story is laced with enough solid jokes and presented with a flock of clever characters. The beautiful craftsmanship of this film speaks for itself.
0,Fresh,This film is for anyone who dreams of doing something that's never been done before - and for those who enjoy watching it happen.
1,Rotten,"When one actor plays both hero and villain, the viewer knows that what is being shown is not an authentic dance."
0,Fresh,"Hell Up in Harlem is a lean, mean work of Blaxploitation that may not stand as one of the genre's high water marks but still entertains to this day thanks to the natural charms of Fred Williamson and the brazen instincts of Larry Cohen."
1,Rotten,Cat-astrophic special effects ruin Tom Hooper's adaptation of the infamous stage musical Cats.
1,Rotten,"To call ""Ride Along 2"" rubbish is unfair to rubbish, which at some point had a purpose."
1,Rotten,A capable cast can't elevate this mediocre coming-of-age comedy.
0,Fresh,"The finale is a touch overdramatic, but the film is nonetheless a first-class war epic."
1,Rotten,Full of hot air.
0,Fresh,"Cheadle -- who co-wrote the script with Steven Baigelman -- may have been trying to be worthy of Davis, who at one point in the movie says that if you're going to do something, it's best to do it with attitude."
1,Rotten,The first five or 10 minutes of Airplane II -- The Sequel are genuinely funny -- so funny I thought maybe this movie was going to work. That turned out to be a premature hope.
1,Rotten,"If Daddy's Home (2015) played like a distant, wayward cousin of Step Brothers, Daddy's Home 2, again directed by Sean Anders, is the sort of relative you might disown."
0,Fresh,"James Franco directs the film with sensitivity and painstaking detail, and gives a fantastic performance as one of the worst filmmakers -- and one of the most unusual human beings -- ever."
1,Rotten,"On odd mishmash that leads to some headscratchingly bizarre moments, while ultimately skirting incoherence of purpose."
0,Fresh,"With a spring in its step and a song in its heart, Tangled is undoubtedly one of Disney's most uproariously enjoyable movies in years."
0,Fresh,"Similar to like-minded BBC series In The Flesh(...), The Cured is most interested in exploring how social cohesion is threatened when disparate people and divergent beliefs are put in a pressure cooker."
0,Fresh,"There's a muted absurdist thread running through A Coffee in Berlin, and while Niko's quest for the titular brew devolves into a series of whimsical frustrations, the filmmaker's motives are more serious."
1,Rotten,"[An] exceptionally insipid, cloying romantic adventure for kids."
1,Rotten,just goes through the motions of parodying one movie after another without any apparent stab at wit or humor
1,Rotten,...an attempt to squeeze one more movie out of a used MacGuffin.
0,Fresh,One of the best films of 2017.
0,Fresh,"If the ability to genuinely disturb is any measure of a horror film's quality, then The Lost is a pretty good one."
1,Rotten,One of the very worst ideas for a movie since they decided to try to make a horror movie about rabbits.
0,Fresh,U.S. imperialism exposed as a categorical imperative by this damning documentary about the Military Industrial Complex.
0,Fresh,Bogdanovich takes a tale of old Hollywood and infuses it with velocity and enthusiasm.
0,Fresh,"This isn't a movie about big emotional breakthroughs, but about the slow thaw taking place in Juliette's heart, and writer-director Philippe Claudel and the actors do an excellent job in charting a series of small, telling steps forward."
0,Fresh,A cinematic experience you can't miss. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,You willl feel like you are living with two men in a giant phallus in a solitary spot in the middle of the sea. Who's Afraid of Spongebob Squarepants?
1,Rotten,"The first feature from writer-director Elaine Constantine, herself a Northern soul veteran, the film follows a fairly familiar innocent-led-astray storyline."
0,Fresh,"What follows will knock you silly, upending every single concept of storytelling that you're probably used to."
1,Rotten,CLOVER is not as clever as it thinks it is but it benefits from a strong cast...
0,Fresh,"Boring plot, impressive but depressing production - a boys - toys movie"
0,Fresh,It's the kind of thing that only comes along once every few decades.
1,Rotten,"Very broad and very silly, it's a doodle of a comedy -- a one-joke idea (fat guy goes luchador) padded out to feature length by Black's willingness to do anything for a laugh."
1,Rotten,[Hardwicke] falls short in the hardest part of her job - pruning back Peralta's unwieldy script to get to the heart of these boys' unique bond as friends and competitors.
0,Fresh,[A] movie master at his best.
0,Fresh,"Seeing the two horror icons come together for an ultimate showdown is definitely fun to watch, but the outcome of the most-hyped villainous face-off ever proves to be a bit of a letdown."
0,Fresh,"Ever since Mary, the Farrellys have struggled to find a more mature comedic voice. Stuck on You finds them hitting their stride, adding sentiment without compromising their quirkiness."
0,Fresh,Another solid entry in the Denis resume.
0,Fresh,"A fluffy, naughty, cynical, and most of all - musical - good time."
1,Rotten,"It's a humble little item, actually, easily digested and easily forgotten."
0,Fresh,Fans of Carney's lush romanticism and hook-laden lyricism will be thrilled to add this one to their playlist.
0,Fresh,A film that rewards patience and attention. The filmmaking will draw you in and the acting and story will keep you rooted to your seat.
0,Fresh,"Although playing the unabashed curmudgeon next door is the kind of thing Bill Murray could do in his sleep, this treasured actor instead brings everything he has to the role of Vincent MacKenna."
0,Fresh,"An expansive, energetic, big-budget martial arts action film that encompasses combat, explosions and moments of introspection."
0,Fresh,"Dark Shadows, a kinky love triangle, is true, in its fashion, to the spirit of the old soap opera. Yet its real love affair is between Johnny Depp and the audience who's still hooked on seeing him get his freak on."
0,Fresh,"Star-studded recollection of Panama Papers scandal is lively, eye-opening and yet another vehicle for the stupendous award winning Meryl Streep."
0,Fresh,This feels like grown-up Star Wars.
1,Rotten,"Wannabe film students and hipster cinephiles are the target audience for this crude, vulgar, gross comedy."
0,Fresh,"One of the most well-crafted, magical family films ever made"
0,Fresh,One need not be a fan of the audacious style of Jack Pollock to admire Ed Harris' journeyman effort to bring the tortured life of one of America's true originals to the screen
0,Fresh,So Yong Kim takes what could have been routine story elements and transforms them into something deeply sad and touching.
0,Fresh,Its dramatic success seems to derive largely from putting the inhabitants of separate worlds into a context where both belong.
1,Rotten,"With superficial characters, this look at the British justice system is a dour disappointment."
0,Fresh,"I loved this movie. It's entertaining, emotionally moving. Sometimes it's mean, sometimes it's funny as hell, sometimes it's sweet, but it's never boring, repetitive or dull."
0,Fresh,"Wild is a simmering pot on the back burner of the viewer's mind, slowly pulling out the flavours of personal experience to create a hearty, and highly personal, rustic potage of sweet forgiveness."
1,Rotten,"A wispy picture, likeable certainly but lacking in crispness and clarity."
1,Rotten,"""Prom"" is so strenuously inoffensive it makes Disney's ""High School Musical"" look almost racy by comparison."
1,Rotten,"""The Sound of Silence"" wants to be heard, but, in the end, doesn't have much to say."
0,Fresh,"Uncovered has no interest in explaining the Bush administration's case for war for them: This is the prosecution's argument, and it is extremely well-made."
0,Fresh,A small-scale and intimate biopic about a key participant in one of the most large-scale scientific accomplishments of our age.
0,Fresh,This is that rare movie that observes the lower class with an eye toward understanding precisely how such an economic prison forms and is perpetuated.
1,Rotten,"The less is more approach usually works for this reviewer, however here it was much too little and lead to an expected ending with very little pay off."
0,Fresh,"Christian McKay's performance in the title role measures up to that extraordinariness, both inhabiting Welles's magnetic, overweening personality and approximating a decent physical likeness."
1,Rotten,...the movie plays like a second rate Jacob's Ladder...
0,Fresh,"There's a surprising amount of bite: the filmmakers openly acknowledge the similarities between the Great Depression and the present, and the populist message, however overstated, always registers as sincere."
1,Rotten,"Looks like a million dollars, but in reality is just chump change."
0,Fresh,[A] rather affectionate and candid portrait of a singer/TV personality whose continuing respiration is regarded as a marvel of human achievement.
1,Rotten,"It's not sharp or funny or scabrous enough to work as a dark comedy and it leaves an uncomfortable taste, in part because Barker never actually broke a story of profound significance. She was the story."
1,Rotten,"In this ditzy whirl nothing is pushed too far -- the bad aren't really bad, they're all sorry. And the assumption that high school is where it all happens is ringingly endorsed."
1,Rotten,Nowhere near as probing as it could or should be. Valuable points are blunted by too many talking heads.
0,Fresh,"Adoration spins an intricate weave of deception, an avatar maze in which almost every character is revealed to have more than one persona."
0,Fresh,A good film that unfortunately doesn't stand out from the crop. The performances by Thomas Jane and Luke Kleintank are solid and there are a few moments of real inspiration.
0,Fresh,A film that guarantees good entertainment. It's a different and renewed look at this kind of cinema and a resurrection without a doubt. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Blanchett and Crudup are on the verge of stardom, but they're toppled here by a familiar and tepid story."
1,Rotten,"In the very first shot, two deliriously happy young lovebirds -- Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) -- exit a movie theater. Don't give us any ideas."
1,Rotten,A brutally boring mini-series...
0,Fresh,A whip-smart dramedy about murder and moral purpose.
0,Fresh,"A fantastically captivating historical epic, which beautifully evokes its setting."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, the movie may puzzle audiences more than entertain them."
0,Fresh,A taut -- if violent -- police thriller.
1,Rotten,"One of the worst films of the year, by a country mile."
0,Fresh,"The characters all seem to have known each other for years, referring to long-held grudges and resentments that only gradually are revealed to the audience. They're a seedy, petty, dangerous and delightful bunch."
0,Fresh,"A witty, sarcastic take on redemption."
0,Fresh,The Social Network combines a multitude of impressions and conflicting first-person accounts in a trajectory that is refreshingly coherent.
0,Fresh,Corbet's willingness to approach his subject matter with the freedom of a novelist or a painter and push the form on a scale that feels simultaneously grand and intimate is thrilling to watch.
0,Fresh,"The Muppets never went away, and ""The Muppets"" is a celebration of that. It's time to play the music, and it's time to light the lights."
0,Fresh,"Not only is it Spielberg's best, but it could have been one of Kubrick's as well."
1,Rotten,"... With a broad comedy like this, gut reactions generally rule. You either laugh or you don't, and ""The Hangover Part III"" simply isn't funny."
1,Rotten,"Even if you agree with Clay's rigid moral stance, you'll probably be put off by this remarkably dull, tone-deaf argument for chastity."
1,Rotten,"If more action propelled this water-treading plot, Ayer might have produced the mean streets classic that Harsh Times aspires to be."
0,Fresh,"The meeting of Patrick Stewart's Jean Luc Picard and William Shatner's James T. Kirk is worth the price of admission or video rental: it's the clash of the titans, Shakespeare meets the Sixties."
1,Rotten,The unapologetic lack of political correctness never goes beyond a one-dimensional and tentative provocation.
1,Rotten,...a strangely uninvolving thriller...
0,Fresh,"Gerwig keeps you on side and rooting for Frances to get her act together in what becomes an affectionate salute to messy lives, an endearing underachiever and a New York state of mind."
0,Fresh,"This really is the best way to experience the life of a musician, and it makes for mesmeric viewing."
0,Fresh,... a slow burn done right with plenty of emotional connection and payoff. It's one of those films that is a must see this summer for those looking for something else than pure action and explosions.
0,Fresh,"""Hysteria,"" set in 1880s London, is a light comedy about a pretty dark time for the fairer sex."
0,Fresh,"The breeziness and eventual dramatic weight of the story, along with the hilarious, snappy dialogue, help the film rise above its basic ordinariness."
0,Fresh,"It might not get as much Oscar attention as his previous films, but it will still add to his luster."
1,Rotten,"The reasons to avoid House of D, David Duchovny's earnest, unwatchable coming-of-age drama, can best be summarized in a simple declarative sentence. Robin Williams plays a retarded janitor."
0,Fresh,"Fashion designer Tom Ford makes a stylishly elegant debut with his effective adaptation of Isherwood's seminal, stream-of-consciousness tale of love and loss, featuring Colin Firth in a multi-nuanced, tonally perfect Oscar-caliber turn."
0,Fresh,"Nevertheless, the performances are uniformly excellent with Oyelowo conveying both the iconic magnetism and human-sized modesty of King's personality."
0,Fresh,It's clear virtually from the get-go that Cape Fear's success is due almost entirely to Mitchum's absolutely spellbinding turn as the vile antagonist...
0,Fresh,"Many terms applied to action movies - muscular, animalistic, testosterone-fueled - are literally true of Bullhead."
1,Rotten,Answers a burning question: What if Mad Max: Fury Road had sucked?
1,Rotten,"Dramatically, it's pale and wan, an almost defiant bore. It sits there, like a month-old stew hiding in the back of the fridge: thick, gummy, indigestible."
0,Fresh,The always charismatic Phoenix inhabits the challenging role of Callahan with seeming ease and magnetic allure.
0,Fresh,Byrne's deeply felt portrayal anchors a stylish film that's both unsettling and fascinating in its intimate exploration of impulsive young love.
0,Fresh,"A goofy, stylish heist movie that'll steal moviegoers from other pictures as surely as Danny Ocean and his dirty dozen will get their hands on the Faberg egg they've decided to filch."
0,Fresh,A bold film for people who aren't afraid to laugh at a movie that cheerfully breaks all sense of civility and decorum.
0,Fresh,"It's very well paced, it's very well balanced in terms of how it deals with the cahracters, but man is it action-packed!"
0,Fresh,"Does some wonderfully seditious feminist things while also being funny as hell. Finally, we are asked to laugh with Melissa McCarthy, not at her."
0,Fresh,"Only Quentin Tarantino's immense popularity, based on his films' cathartic gouts of blood and dialogue, could have allowed him to make such a crazy and compelling Grand Guignol Western."
0,Fresh,[A] polished shocker whose realistic special effects will limit its audience to hardcore horror fans.
0,Fresh,It doesn't care to explain how a jacuzzi becomes a de facto DeLorean ... nor does it get too bogged down in its butterfly effect meddlings -- it just wants to be a piece of good-times stupidness.
0,Fresh,"The picture runs a mere 84 minutes, but it's no glance. It's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written, beautifully read and, finally, deeply humanizing."
0,Fresh,"Rutten is a natural ham, and his off-kilter, upbeat, Euro-kook personality is one of the movie's wild cards, and keeps a story that relies heavily on formula from being stale."
0,Fresh,"When all is said and done ""Hollywood Homicide"" is another buddy-cop film..."
0,Fresh,"This is not a dumb movie; in fact, with its heavy reliance upon real science, it's startlingly credible."
0,Fresh,"This movie has everything: a swept-off-your-feet romantic fantasy, an underdog-makes-good journey, a wrenching substance abuse drama, and an industry cautionary tale combined."
1,Rotten,"Despite being based on the fascinating events of the 1692 Salem witch trials, The Lords of Salem sadly fails to offer anything exciting, thanks to a weak script, lack of scares and dreadful sound quality."
0,Fresh,this 'one last job' serves equally as a metaphor for a Britain rapidly losing its greatness.
0,Fresh,"The heist itself, though, is a superb piece of movie-making."
1,Rotten,"By turns irritating and inviting; Jarmusch's allusive metaphysics has a sensual glide, but much of what he's doing here is also too, too hip."
0,Fresh,...like watching a pair of one-man shows face off against each other.
0,Fresh,"A very fine screenplay based on a novel written by a neuroscience researcher with a PhD from Harvard who obviously knew the territory, including the life-style of its mandarin lead character toppled by Alzheimers."
1,Rotten,"So earnest that it drools its messages all over the place, like an intoxicated teenager slurring his words without the presence of mind to think about what he's saying or how."
0,Fresh,"O.K. courtroom drama, electrified by great Newman performance"
1,Rotten,Heavy-handed French drama is a clumsy affair.
0,Fresh,"It's a bit long perhaps, and we could have done without much of the last half hour, but those fights scenes really are exceptional, astonishing feats of choreography and editing that make mortal combat look like art."
0,Fresh,"Spielberg undoubtedly is asking us to pay attention and learn something - there is no nodding off in this class - but even with all the talk of ratification, and envoys, and securing votes, Lincoln is an engaging, if not rousing film-going experience."
0,Fresh,One of the very best sci-fi/horror pictures of one of that genre's best decades.
0,Fresh,Theological leadership drama more for adults than kids.
0,Fresh,"This is a funny-serious, family-friendly movie about a weighty subject, and somehow it works."
0,Fresh,Sean Baker once again pulls us into a world we never thought we could fall in love with.
0,Fresh,"An intense combination of action, drama, and love story that makes a memorable and interesting war movie."
1,Rotten,"A gross comedy about a teenage zombie's romance with the prettiest girl in school, it is cheaply made, thoroughly cliched and absolutely guaranteed to turn your stomach."
0,Fresh,It's really quite good.
0,Fresh,Nothing Can Hurt Me is the perfect music doc in that it services longtime fans while providing the opportunity to make new ones as well.
0,Fresh,"Director Pablo Larraín's Jackie is a powerful if traumatic achievement, in approach as well as execution. So is Natalie Portman's performance in the title role."
0,Fresh,(Eastwood) keeps the story simple ... warning that a combination of police wanting to solve a big case quickly and a media hungry for scoops and headlines can be a fearsome combination that can swallow an individual whole without a second thought.
1,Rotten,This one is your basic collection of aspiring trainee cliches -- think Fame with a dumber plot and prettier dancing.
1,Rotten,One for real horror-buffs only.
0,Fresh,Look at Gehry. Look at the work. Neither he nor we can be sure precisely how so many glorious buildings came into being. That's the beauty of transcendence. Right there in front of Pollack's camera.
0,Fresh,"Verhoeven's version of Philip Dick's story is vigorous, exciting, and inventive sci-fi thriller, combining pulp savviness, ultra-graphic violence, and Oscar-winning special effects."
1,Rotten,"America's Sweethearts begins as a smartly promising, gently farcical comedy of manners and ends as sourly and haphazardly as the lives it is poking fun at."
0,Fresh,"Overlit, staged like a high school play, but saved by the cast and Cole Porter songs"
0,Fresh,"[T]here's much to admire here, especially the fine combination of cinematographer Philip Lathrop's images and Roger Spottiswoode's editing of the exciting fight sequences."

0,Fresh,There's no miraculous 'Renegades rally from thirty points down in the last two minutes to win' nonsense here.
1,Rotten,Everybody in and around this movie is trying too hard.
1,Rotten,"Throughout, gags are cartoonishly broad and afforded so little time for setup and delivery we seem to be watching less a story than a catalog of tossed-out material."

0,Fresh,"Darkly inspired, A Monster Calls is highly affecting - but surely too much so as a survival aid for the children who might need it? Yet it's not quite for adult adults either."
0,Fresh,"[Kate McKinnon] is described in the film as ""a little much"", but she offers a correction: ""I'm a lot much."" And without the charms of its stars, The Spy Who Dumped Me wouldn't be much of anything at all."
0,Fresh,"Mudbound is the work of a filmmaker whose vision is uninhibited. Even when it falters through later narrative twists that become almost too much to bear, it's a captivating experience-one that we're lucky exists."
0,Fresh,"A compelling, high-octane thriller, literally and figuratively!"
0,Fresh,"It is Close, though, on whom Runge's camera focuses. Quiet and reserved, yet forceful and ultimately determined, Close's Joan reflects a sense of real power behind her all-knowing yet cryptic smile."

1,Rotten,It's the mayonnaise of movies.
0,Fresh,"A breath of fresh air, as rare and as beautiful as the Selkies it depicts."
1,Rotten,"A highly schematic film about how the members of a family each revel in their own sexuality; there's a nice, healthy glow here apparently meant to substitute for story."
0,Fresh,"Boyle uses the stomping rhythms of Bollywood showtunes just as he used the thrusting beat of Iggy Pop to drive Trainspotting, and the result is his best picture since that 1996 hit."

1,Rotten,"If you love your mom, you might want to stay away but if you hate her, by all means, bring her to watch Snatched."
1,Rotten,This dark comedy's clever premise is too thin to sustain its feature-length running time.

0,Fresh,"What makes Call Be By Your Name stand out from the films it will be compared to is Guadagnino's play on juxtapositions, which go much deeper than merely an angsty teen with an introspective soul."
1,Rotten,"The movie -- a metaphor for the tangled, impossible state of Israeli/Palestinian relations -- only intermittently clicks."

1,Rotten,Most of its kinetic choreography is transformed into arduous onslaughts that numb rather than thrill.

1,Rotten,[Warcraft's] derivative nature is not an unforgivable sin. What tips it over into the realm of rank odorousness is the acting and the dialogue.

1,Rotten,"...unlikely to win over any converts outside its target demographic, but its a solid effort nonetheless."
0,Fresh,"It's all forward momentum, except when it pauses to let Aaron Eckhart's world-weary staff sergeant deliver a generic motivational speech. And even that moment is comfortably familiar, simultaneously superficial and satisfying."
0,Fresh,"It's hardly classic animated fare, but it's breezy and distracting enough to make a passable entertainment."

0,Fresh,The Crazies is creepy and it made me squirm with discomfort.
0,Fresh,"Spottiswoode keeps the vibe gritty and authentic, which is in itself remarkable for a film about a young man and a cat. Tough and tender, and a massive, welcome February surprise."

0,Fresh,"If you like period pieces with psychopathic characters, excellent actors and plenty of atmospherics, then you could do worse than a trip to ""Stonehearst Aslyum."""
1,Rotten,"A pretty straightforward attempt to pick up any slack left by the tiring Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. That's to say, it's preposterous panto for the kiddies."
0,Fresh,With the close-knit psychological ambiance of an early Roman Polanski film (particularly 1965's Repulsion) Fincher paints American middle class as a blood-curdling emotional danger zone.
1,Rotten,"Kazan had only made one previous film, and the stilted melodrama reflects the director's inexperience as he failed to get more than adequate performances from the two leads, whom he felt intimidated by."
0,Fresh,"A cross between Stand And Deliver and Hoosiers,...it's no all-star, but not a bench-warmer either."
1,Rotten,"Feels insincere, with too much corrosive behavior clouding the themes of the film and the needs of the characters."
1,Rotten,"Towelhead is a mess, and it's based on material that demanded precision."
0,Fresh,"A smidgen of originality lies in its being a noir film with Korean characters: others nothing new, but still a watchable gangster pic."
0,Fresh,Barry is about someone trying - and often failing - to fuse to any group that will have him. He uses charm like a chisel. He's always hacking into people's armor to convince them he belongs
1,Rotten,"It seems, ironically, much more amateurish than any of Roth's previous features, to the point where you start to wonder why he chose this as his comeback vehicle."
0,Fresh,"More Intense than Any of Franco's Work in ""General Hospital""."
0,Fresh,"Isn't as inspired, or as gory, as the best of Evil Dead, but it's still good senseless fun."
0,Fresh,The aerial action has been carefully crafted for excitement and offer impressive scenes of skylines full of fighter planes: the mix of CGI and 2D animation give depth and a gloss that would make Michael Bay proud.
0,Fresh,"By focusing on the Muppets of The Muppet Show (1976-1981) rather than the independent Muppets of prior films, the writers open up an unexplored aspect of Muppet lore ripe for revival."

1,Rotten,This routine video-game spinoff borrows heavily from James Cameron action flicks and George Romero zombie epics but doesn't do much else.

1,Rotten,This inane film is definitely a wayward canine in need of an animal-control officer.
1,Rotten,"... not funny... (and) irresponsible, picturing sociopathic killers and racketeers as clownish buffoons. What's next for Lumet and his crew; a musical comedy about John Gotti?"
0,Fresh,Who knew Bill Hader could be so great in a (mostly) drama?
1,Rotten,"The dramatic material, overheated to begin with, is hyped up by hysterical acting and further exaggerated by a busy mise-en-scene based on meaningless camera movements and space-destroying zooms."
0,Fresh,"The performances are quite good, the footage keeps the interest from beginning to end... [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,"A solid, albeit flawed, effort. Stellar work by Leonardo DiCaprio, but Cate Blanchett's masterful, Oscar-worthy performance steals the film."

0,Fresh,"Toni Erdmann is an immensely rich, deeply-felt exploration of human relationships that draws you in and holds you fast for nearly three hours."
1,Rotten,Something has been lost in the translation...another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise.

1,Rotten,It's maudlin and confused-ultimately hampered by the poisonous pairing of cliches and self-importance.
0,Fresh,"In the lead role, Anya Taylor-Joy creates an admirably spiky character who is less likable than some of her screen predecessors, and all the better for it."
0,Fresh,"It is intensely watchable, with the relentless accumulation of effects used here for the purposes of eliciting suspense rather than provoking comedy."
0,Fresh,"...a post-apocalyptic drama focused not on marauding mutants, but on the old, awful standbys: fear, loneliness, cold, starvation."
0,Fresh,"Takes some time to find solid footing and pull us in, but the promise of dark dangers is ultimately fulfilled."
0,Fresh,"Oak solid and unsinkable, Master And Commander is old-fashioned entertainment crafted with considerable care."
1,Rotten,The best that can be said for Runaway Jury is that it does not disappoint expectations: This is not a case of dumbing down literature; it's mediocrity aimed for and successfully achieved.
1,Rotten,"Absent any emotional grounding, the film is a gorgeous, sterile construction, like a dream city unoccupied by humans."
0,Fresh,"Lear was a TV pathfinder, all right, but his path is carpeted with rose petals."

1,Rotten,"Like most other talking-animal movies, it winds up talking down to its audience."
1,Rotten,"To the old box-office maxim that trite makes right, a fresh corollary must be attached: Chaos is the new order, and ugly the new beautiful."
0,Fresh,Let me be the first to declare the breakout hit of the summer has finally arrived. This movie is so good it will bring tears of joy to your eyes. It balances frank discussions with humorous situations. It doesn't follow the..

0,Fresh,"It's a horrifying but gripping movie, because we can discern the fighting tactics, identify with individuals, even savor the valor and sacrifices of the enemy."
1,Rotten,"The Emoji Movie is the worst of cinema made for children and families-a lazy, barely developed story that relies on audience recognition of phone apps. Not funny or fun."
0,Fresh,"Throughout, the content and tenor of certain stories told by Mick Rock ambitiously inform the film's style."

0,Fresh,What appears to be a slyly amusing film about an experiment that sounds mostly just goofy turns into a reasonably serious indictment of those conducting the experiment.
1,Rotten,"The direction by Robert Stromberg is an immediate mess. A long-time special-effects whiz making his filmmaking debut, he crowds every scene with gimmickry; the opening CGI landscapes are so overdone they look like bad cartoons."
0,Fresh,A serious and refined drama which has the feel of a political firecracker.
0,Fresh,"McCarthy and Scott capitalize their themes: this is The End. This is The End of the Road, the End of Civilization, the End of Capitalism. This isn't neo-noir, it's über-noir."

0,Fresh,"This spectacularly great reboot is surprisingly owned not by Hardy, who is fine, but by Charlize Theron."
0,Fresh,"...gently wacky. Although breezy and sketchy on the easy laughs at times, Alien Trespass does promise to entertain for the sole purpose of its campy off-kilter makeup."
1,Rotten,"It's a wild mess, and it commits the worst crime a messy film can make--it completely lacks entertainment. It's an overly violent, unintelligible bore."
1,Rotten,"Grows winded and repetitive, pawing at abyssal psychological issues worth investigating, with Pesce downplaying grit to make a surface appreciation for derangement and, at times, filmmaking itself."
0,Fresh,"In an irreverent and adorable coming-to-maturity story, Michael Cera displays versatility in a dual role."
0,Fresh,"In the realm of action films, the whole thing works pretty well."
0,Fresh,"Even if The Death And Life Of Marsha P. Johnson doesn't wholly deliver on its premise, France does a remarkable job of finding the continuity between New York in the '70s, '90s, and now."
0,Fresh,"This is the kind of picture that isn't afraid to put its characters under a microscope, and it knows that studying their psychology is far more rewarding than studying their gun-slinging skills."
1,Rotten,"Dolittle is the sort of film that believes a vicious tiger named Barry getting kicked in the groin by a gorilla and exclaiming ""Oh, my Barry berries!"" is the height of humor. Moviegoers under the age of 10 might agree with this sentiment."
1,Rotten,"Comedy sequels frequently deliver on being terrible, but Ride Along 2 is a case of extreme laziness. It's nothing more than an attempt at once again making gangbusters during the doldrums of January"
1,Rotten,It is the audience who will feel duped even more than the characters in the film.
0,Fresh,Disturbing and jarring ... but masterfully directed and acted.
0,Fresh,"Invincible is part The Rookie, part Rocky and all heart."
0,Fresh,Crimson Peak has the feel of classic literature. Its movements are precise. Its characters tread paths that only an intelligent author can devise.
1,Rotten,By the end you'll feel like a bored parent trapped in the front row of the school play.
1,Rotten,Chen ... keeps things so downy soft that you're parched for a little drama -- a spat here hurts about as much as a slumber-party pillow fight.
1,Rotten,Serves as proof that Allen's heart isn't in it anymore.
0,Fresh,Stop Loss takes some time out from the argument over the validity of the war to ask a question closer to home - whether the emotional battlefield America subjects its young soldiers to is actually worth it.
1,Rotten,A pretentious drama.
1,Rotten,The songs seem to have been written over lunch at the Disney cafeteria.
0,Fresh,"In addition to Olsen's mesmerizing performance, John Hawkes turns in yet another award-worthy performance as the haunting and unforgettable Patrick."
1,Rotten,Bunk of the very lowest level.
1,Rotten,Spark: A Space Tail is a real mishmash of a movie.
0,Fresh,"The majority of the film can't quite live up to this barnstorming first half hour, but it remains a delight throughout, even when the gags become a little more hit and miss."
0,Fresh,"Schaffner conduz a trama com segurança absoluta, permitindo que o espectador junte as peças do quebra-cabeças ao mesmo tempo em que seu diligente e improvável herói, vivido de forma espetacular por Olivier (mas Peck também merece aplausos)."
0,Fresh,"Not only is their playlist worth a listen, but Nick and Norah are surprisingly good company with whom to spend a long night in the city."
1,Rotten,"Emotionally arid and narratively lazy, the film is so tentative it seems to be evaporating before our very eyes."
0,Fresh,"Bekmambetov directs with gusto, and the forthright absurdity of the story, combined with its weirdly heartfelt self-belief is winning."
1,Rotten,Concussion aims to be Brian's Song and ends up The Waterboy.
0,Fresh,"Burton's command of this material and his masterful visual sense makes this ""Dumbo"" an engaging delight. Like that winsome elephant, it really does soar."
0,Fresh,"Tyson is terrifically compelling and, more than that, unexpectedly moving."
0,Fresh,... a breezy and charming stop-motion animated adventure that really kicks into gear once the title character joins the mayhem.
0,Fresh,"This bizarrely funny satire/allegory from the maker of heavier fare such as In the Company of Men works on a surprising number of levels, not the least of which is perhaps the first human Renee Zellweger performance I have ever seen."
0,Fresh,"Superhero sequel has more action, bigger stakes and a sprawling cast, adding up to big-time popcorn satisfaction."
1,Rotten,"With a little more focus, Downsizing might feel like a more satisfying film."
0,Fresh,"The film is ridiculous and laugh-out-loud funny, though it's sometimes hard to tell if this is intentional or not. Either way, it remains riveting because of its effective tropes."
0,Fresh,"There's surely more to unpick here on second viewing: Chang-dong has spun a philosophical, slow-burn yarn that remains constantly gripping through its entire 148-minute runtime."
1,Rotten,"... you can always count on a bad fart joke (of which ""Nacho Libre"" boasts several) to get a laugh, whether it deserves one or not."
1,Rotten,"Chastain and Heldenbergh are solid, but the script's rough edges leave the leading lady in the background. It's doubtful the film will be remembered come summertime."
0,Fresh,It should never have been this good.
0,Fresh,"Hou Hsiao-hsien's trademark long takes call attention to the passage of time, and as such they're intimately attuned to his ongoing thematic interest in the bonds between the past, present, and future."
0,Fresh,"One of the more recent films I've seen where you can tell that director, cast and crew had a succinct vision and poured their hearts and souls into it."
1,Rotten,"Colossal has a terrific, almost irresistible metaphor at its core, and it's really a shame the movie doesn't much know what to do with it."
0,Fresh,"I'm not a Michael Bay fan, but despite myself, I was really enjoying this. A guilty pleasure."
1,Rotten,"The script gets less adventurous as it goes along, slowly shedding every intriguing idea and character detail for an utterly conventional final act."
0,Fresh,"If you're a kid whose summer holidays are starting to drag, this should kill a couple of hours. Just do your folks a favour and don't make them come along."
1,Rotten,"A piece that, despite all the flying machines, seems an earthbound retread of the 'Spy Kids' movies, marked by even less magic and imagination."
0,Fresh,This 1950 thriller is minor only by the standards of genius.
0,Fresh,Classic goofiness!!! An acquired taste for sure.
0,Fresh,"It's as big, funny, shiny, explosive, expert, rip-roaringly entertaining an action movie as we've seen in a long time."
0,Fresh,"The notion of a love story that's really about two women becoming friends is gimmicky, I'll grant, but Graynor and Miller are so charming together..."
1,Rotten,The film's plea for tolerance is commendable but would have more weight if only it were executed with more panache.
0,Fresh,It's Oliver Twist by way of City of God.
1,Rotten,Lance Bass in his debut performance overdoses the audience with too much wide-eyed innocence and enthusiasm.
0,Fresh,Moonlight Mile makes you realize how much Dustin Hoffman's presence on the big screen has been missed the past few years.
0,Fresh,The Aristocrats is an unrepentantly filthy movie...and a very funny one.
0,Fresh,"a tale so loose limbed parts of the plot have almost been amputated...The film's like an elite distant cousin to Michael Bay's ""Pain and Gain."""
0,Fresh,"Sure, it's shallow, but it's also slickly compelling, beautifully crafted and so damn shiny."
0,Fresh,Ocean's Eleven is a merry romp that delivers laughs in aces and boasts a full house of marquee talent.
0,Fresh,"It's an enchantingly well-done tribute that revives, and even refreshes, our affection for the Stooges, yet at its core it lacks the completely and totally unhinged shock of the new."
1,Rotten,"At times hilarious and definitely the best date movie in theaters, but that's not saying all that much."
0,Fresh,Martin Scorsese's love letter to filmmaking finally proves that 3D is a necessary aesthetic to storytelling if used correctly. I definitely shed a few nerd tears!
0,Fresh,"[Concussion] is anchored by a sensitive, understated performance by Will Smith as the real-life forensic pathologist who earned the NFL's animosity for shining a torch on the problem in Pittsburgh, home of the revered Steelers."
0,Fresh,"Scene for scene, this is a remarkable film, superbly acted, directed, photographed and edited, thought provoking but unpretentious."
0,Fresh,"Anton Corbijn made a Western, and he damn sure wants you to know it."
0,Fresh,Irresistible performances and a bizarre true story make for good entertainment
0,Fresh,"If you can set aside the movie's countless flaws and just go to watch a stupid mindless movie, then you are good to go with this film."
0,Fresh,What Abrams has created here is a near-perfect summer movie.
1,Rotten,"This 2005 feature offered me my first taste of Guy Ritchie's macho-centric artiness, and I hope it's my last."
1,Rotten,"Marked by jarring jumps in tone from broad comedy to drama, action-suspense and, most ridiculously, earnest 'message' material about the unfairness of standardized testing."
0,Fresh,"Caterina in the Big City won't change your life, but it moves along spiffily and the young Teghil is adorable as she adventures gamely onward."
0,Fresh,Attenborough shows once again his skill in managing the big set-piece.
1,Rotten,"... a depressing slog, filled with its own sense of inflated self-importance..."
0,Fresh,We really get to know some of these soldiers and their families in a way that goes beyond most war films. That gives the film additional emotional impact.
0,Fresh,"A thoroughly engaging, beautifully directed and superbly acted romantic drama that packs a powerful emotional punch."
0,Fresh,"A polished, pleasant trifle that should enchant wee ones during hours and hours of repeat viewings."
0,Fresh,There is no denying that Scott and Crowe work well together.
1,Rotten,Euphoria is undeniably a missed opportunity at creating a drama of frayed sisterhood that feels fresh and unique.
1,Rotten,"As a stressed-out high school guidance counselor who helps his students by murdering their abusive relatives, Scott walks a fine line between sympathetic and sinister, in a film that never really finds its purpose."
0,Fresh,"Feels warm and genuinely affectionate in a way that's impossible to manufacture. You've seen this story before, but maybe not populated with personalities this fully realized and alive."
1,Rotten,James Mangold counts Stanley Donen's Charade and Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest among his inspirations for Knight and Day and I'm still wondering why.
1,Rotten,The same saccharine joy that made The Lego Movie so great is cloaked all over Gotham City and it just doesn't sit quite right.
0,Fresh,"Revisiting the painful aftermath of Vietnam from the perspective of American-bound refugees, Timothy's film is an honorable if not great companion piece to his brother Tony's Three Seasons; both films played at the Sundance Festival dramatic competition"
0,Fresh,"an alarmingly topical comedy-drama that dredges up far more issues than it can address in its two-and-a-half hours. But give Nichols, writer Elaine May and everyone else an 'A' for effort."
1,Rotten,"It's a long way from 'worst' anything, but the movie otherwise lives down to its not-so-great expectations."
1,Rotten,"You know how people who go out of their way to seem mysterious or interesting are really just annoying? Turns out that applies to fictional people, too."
0,Fresh,what you thought would happen does... and doesn't
0,Fresh,"As polite, charming, and English as its star Gemma Arterton, who sails through the chaos and calamity with the good sense, pluck, and grace of a motherly angel."
0,Fresh,It is easy to imagine Calle 54 having a long shelf life on home video after its run in theaters. It can be played over and over again with increasing satisfaction.
1,Rotten,A laughably absurd fantasy that goes nowhere fast.
0,Fresh,"You don't have to be ""bi curious"" to appreciate it, your love life doesn't have to be in shambles, you don't even need to take a date to see and enjoy the film."
0,Fresh,"You know, if you're not familiar with the television series ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" then you might as well not waste your time reading about ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters."""
1,Rotten,Virtually everything about this production feels thrown together.
1,Rotten,Unsure why it took five different writers to pen this many stereotypes and genre tropes into one of the year's most forgettable scary movies.
0,Fresh,Good low-calorie fun.
1,Rotten,This film contains the stereotypical western adventure movie material.
1,Rotten,This is a $70 million movie with A-list stars who really should have known better and fails to deliver much more than the odd bit of interesting monster design and frequently unintentionally hilarious dialogue.
1,Rotten,"The result is disappointingly televisual, the verdict wholly predictable."
1,Rotten,The only thing Fifty Shades Darker succeeds at is making Fifty Shades of Grey look like a better movie.
0,Fresh,It overflows with middle-aged angst over lost youth. And laments the generic nature of our corporate-driven culture.
0,Fresh,"Although slowly told, Seraphine never drags."
0,Fresh,A universal coming-of-age story as illuminating as it is entertaining.
0,Fresh,"This isn't the meaningful movie it pretends to be. But as a goofy entertainment that speeds through the latter half of the 20th century, stopping here and there to snap a photo or two, Forrest Gump does just fine."
0,Fresh,M*A*S*H* stripped from its wise-guy veneer
0,Fresh,The Post is a call to arms for a battle that's already mostly lost.
0,Fresh,"Funny, if not gut-busting, and well-executed, if not a masterpiece."
1,Rotten,This is a movie you watch with minor pleasure when you happen upon it channel surfing on cable TV. Leaving home for it and selecting it over and above a city's full cinematic outlay is another matter.
0,Fresh,"Too many side characters and too little character development aside, this feature-length car commercial will please petrolheads."
0,Fresh,"Nowhere Boy is fully accessible for everyone, not just fans."
0,Fresh,"Leaving tells the kind of painful story -- of passion, betrayal, revenge -- we might read about every day in the papers, but it is the cool manner of its telling and an outstanding central performance by Kristin Scott Thomas that sharpen our interest."
1,Rotten,"In spite of excellent performances by the three main cast members -- Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte and Daniel Grao -- you may find your mind wandering."
0,Fresh,"Despite its many issues, Ready Player One is still an enjoyable ride that ticks all the boxes of a big summer blockbuster."
0,Fresh,"Pacino is at his best: precise, internal, magnetically cute, and expert at capturing the fear in this man's turtle-like existence and his longing for change."
0,Fresh,The film has a surprising low-budget feel that's well-suited to Chazelle's style and doesn't stray far from his indie film roots.
0,Fresh,"A sexy, seductive portrayal of one young man's downward spiral into existential Hell on the chilly Parisian streets."

1,Rotten,A cinematic lump of coal.
1,Rotten,"Abrams, unfortunately, is not Spielberg. But why should he be? Who else is?"
1,Rotten,"If you're expecting another Enid, forget it. That kind of lightning only strikes once."
0,Fresh,"Campos's good intentions notwithstanding, there's still something uncomfortable - perhaps even exploitative - here, yet an absolutely mesmerising Rebecca Hall is clearly, deeply invested in the role."
0,Fresh,A B-movie worthy of the term.
0,Fresh,In the Fade is a sketch of one woman's grief in the face of hate.
0,Fresh,"At the very least, the film makes up for the (awful) live action adaptations that Universal thrust upon moviegoers a decade ago."

0,Fresh,"Filmmaker Kevin Smith is delighted to be playing with his old toys again, and it shows in the funny, heartfelt, and meta ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot."""
0,Fresh,"Lorna's Silence is not only a beautiful film, but also one that moves the filmmakers' art forward a small step or two -- a tectonic shift for these art cinema old faithfuls."
0,Fresh,"A fright fest of fun with more gore than scares, although there are a few tense scenes, that's balanced by a healthy dose of comedy."
0,Fresh,It continues to be a project of unquestionable importance and unrivaled influence more than 50 years later.
0,Fresh,"Despite its shortcomings, its ramshackle portrait of the band captures their combustible spirit and frequently shows The Who at their very best."

0,Fresh,"It's a dream of the past, a dream of the town that makes our dreams come true."
0,Fresh,"It might take a little bit of extra effort to find The Last Word, but the cinematic experience and Maclaine's wonderful performance is well worth the journey."
1,Rotten,"Next to the subsequent Jayson Blair debacle at The New York Times, the Glass affair is about as scandalous as a condom found in the parking lot at a National Youth Christian Leadership Conference."
0,Fresh,"a ghost train hardly inferior to the first Poltergeist (which has come to be somewhat overrated in the memories of Generation X), but more up to date."
0,Fresh,"[A] stunning film, sometimes remarkably moving - at times sublimely beautiful, often sickeningly brutal, but never banal, nor specifically blameful."
1,Rotten,"[An] unrelentingly grim, plodding, and close-to-incoherent adaptation of Tom Rob Smith's best-selling mystery."
0,Fresh,"The Meg delivers exactly what its advertising campaign promises, with no unexpected surprises, pleasant or otherwise."
0,Fresh,"The Post bills itself as a feminist movie, but it's portrayal of female empowerment is remarkably dated."
1,Rotten,I guess the whole problem is that there's just not enough grifting going on.
1,Rotten,"It finds its filmmaker completely lost between impulses to pay homage, play it safe, or offer something--anything--new."
1,Rotten,"Romance-Sweet, Movie-Not"
0,Fresh,It is a film of our time. It is about how even moral victories are corrupted. It will make you weep and will make you angry. It will tear your guts out.
0,Fresh,"An engrossing, densely plotted thriller."
1,Rotten,"Yikes. Cribbed dialogue from The Empire Strikes Back is this film's only attempt at quality, and even that falls flat."
0,Fresh,"Prince-Bythewood is stingingly astute at what fame does to objectify women. And Gugu Mbatha-Raw, so good this year in Belle, is a shining new star."
0,Fresh,"It's like a giant sculpture that is so strange and off-putting, it's instantly, intriguingly post-modern. Swept up in the film's pile-driving self-assurance, even Bay-haters may absorb the pain to enjoy the gain."
0,Fresh,"At this point in their careers, Hanks and Roberts know a lot about how to make movies and how to reach audiences; these are relaxed and professional star performance, long on charm and short on theatrics."
0,Fresh,There is something to giggle at in nearly every frame of the movie.
0,Fresh,Feels more like a race than a film.
0,Fresh,Crowe hasn't exactly ruined what the original [Abre los Ojos] has offered...even if he's reduced its sense of pathos. The bottom line is that Vanilla Sky still offers more than the average Hollywood film.
0,Fresh,"A series of spectacular set pieces filled with eye-popping special effects, although [director Simon]West does fall back on his trademarked overuse of sound."
0,Fresh,"That said, [Chris] Hemsworth and director [Nicolai] Fuglsig do enough to steer you in the direction of Stanton's book - another must-read to add to that list."

0,Fresh,"A lovely movie, one that allows its characters unexpected spurts of growth and regression, darkness and grace."
1,Rotten,"Realistic and refined, but uneven and disappointing."
0,Fresh,"Appearing in every scene, Denzel Washington renders his most impressive performance since Training Day in a film that's effective as thriller, morality tale, and above all character study, likely to get the attention of Oscar voters."
0,Fresh,... has a lot of humor but is very serious about its premise ... about as good as Hollywood blockbusters get.
0,Fresh,Every theater showing this film should be contractually obligated to smell bad. It's a toxic little picture -- and also something of a masterpiece. See you in Hell.
0,Fresh,Little Monsters could so easily drop into heavy-handed sentimentality but never does. It's clever humor and complete understanding of its premise allows it to balance those dramatic moments with the often times raunchy humor.
0,Fresh,"True to the Will Ferrell formula, going for the joke trumps plot and character development at every turn, with the trademark humor coming via nonsensical slapstick and such Seventies-era fashion statements as cotton-candy afros and loathsome leisure suit"
0,Fresh,"American Psycho is half of a brilliant movie, before it hacks itself to pieces during the final reel."
1,Rotten,Guest of Honour is memorable mainly for the wrong reasons.
0,Fresh,"It's tough to get worked up after watching superior films like Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers."""
1,Rotten,A brilliant concept in search of a movie. Starts off really strong with sly humor and wit that devolves into cheap kiddie jokes.
0,Fresh,"It's a heartbreaking performance by Moore, who never forgets she's portraying a woman whose professional success has been built on intellectual rigour and self-discipline."
0,Fresh,"Given the current discussions in this country on how our school system is failing our kids, the movie's plea for creativity over tests will have surprising resonance for parents too."
1,Rotten,"I've slogged my way through worse films than Post Grad, but what it lacks in sheer awfulness it more than makes up for in utter pointlessness."
0,Fresh,The list of great moments is virtually endless!
0,Fresh,"Through it all, Stalberg and company manage to create some creative visuals involving the paranoia and/or the ecstasy of being high, even if the sequences begin to blur into one hazy memory after awhile."
0,Fresh,"Made more for fans of the original than for new audiences, this installment has plenty of fun and horror goodness to please them while possibly picking up a handful of new converts."
0,Fresh,There's an edge of psychological horror in director Oliver Parker's third Oscar Wilde story that tells how Ben Barnes' Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil in return for his youth and beauty
1,Rotten,"I'm basically exhausted with super hero shenanigans, whether its live action or animated."
0,Fresh,It's not your Roy Rogers western.
0,Fresh,"The film uses rap to express metaphors about racial tensions, prejudice, and the democratization of existing ethnic and cultural stereotypes in an American society tarnished by political correctness. [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,...Gareth Evans has reinvented the action movie once again.
1,Rotten,They say Sanctum was inspired by true events. I can only hope the people in the true event died so they avoid the torture of seeing their story portrayed this way on screen.
0,Fresh,"It's not a perfect movie. At times, it's not even a movie. Yet the overall taste Boarding Gate leaves behind is intriguing enough to appreciate the whole elongated enterprise."
1,Rotten,"The presence of the star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon also emphasizes the utter lack of elegance in Bulletproof Monk's enervating series of gravity-defying, heavily CGI-enhanced feats."
0,Fresh,"Now, Voyager contains one classic image and one classic line of dialogue. As for the rest? It's soap opera par excellence."
1,Rotten,"Somehow dull and exhausting all at once, and the central concept (monsters who fear humans) was explored with far more wit and elegance in Pixar's timeless Monsters, Inc."
0,Fresh,"Impressively directed and superbly written, this is a fascinating and gripping story that packs a powerful emotional punch, thanks to a pair of terrific central performances from Guillaume Canet and Emir Kusturica."
0,Fresh,"The rough edges of Sun-Higginson's Kickstarter-funded feature lend it an ingratiating, unpretentious modesty."
0,Fresh,"A fun house mirror world that never looks quite right because it never is, and never was."
0,Fresh,"A beautifully shot movie that constantly runs the risk of wearing out its welcome. The story and characters are not given their due, yet the film is still enjoyable."
1,Rotten,"J.Lo romcom bursts with frank pregnancy, sex talk."
1,Rotten,An all-too-familiar wallow in urban woe and artfully photographed isolation.
1,Rotten,"'Boat Trip alone left many unanswered questions,' said CNN fixture Larry King as a production assistant shoveled porridge into his mouth."
0,Fresh,"What they've managed is a fair portrayal of group dynamics among weird, artsy types; that it doesn't venture onward to any further points is mitigated by the fact that it feels real, if not profound."
0,Fresh,"Enchanting, edifying and exhilarating."
1,Rotten,"A thing of great beauty, but not much more."
0,Fresh,"Tommy Lee Jones' bracing bigscreen directorial debut, which copped acting and writing awards from the Cannes Film Festival jury, connects with both the head and the heart."
0,Fresh,"With the likes of Nicholson, Keaton, Reeves and Peet -- and a fleeting, funny few minutes with McDormand -- Something's Gotta Give is never less than entertaining."
0,Fresh,"The performances are all very good indeed, and the film's serious, concerned tone suits the subject matter."
0,Fresh,"This successful take on the darkly humorous children's book series is a fantastically painted beauty, its characters rich with flaws and quirks and tragic circumstances."
0,Fresh,A remarkably beautiful film.
1,Rotten,"Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot, no real conflict, no real point."
0,Fresh,One of the finest filns of the year and absolutely worthy of many repeated viewings.
0,Fresh,"The movie isn't about eloquence, it's about giving Mr. Schwarzenegger a chance to take on new enemies that include advancing age."
1,Rotten,Gremlins 2 might have been a better movie if it followed the old Hollywood notion of ingenuity over abundance in special effects. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,Gives the impression at times that filmic history is being rewritten before our eyes.
0,Fresh,"The story is a neat mix of politics, Hollywood manipulation, and family life."
0,Fresh,Very moving.
1,Rotten,"The movie is a colossal letdown on almost every front, but in some ways, it was to be expected considering the magnitude of what DC and Warner Bros. wanted to accomplish only two films into their shared universe"
1,Rotten,"Regrettably, and despite a lot of effects -- including those watery tentacles he seems so fond of -- Kelly delivers a Big Reveal that is, frankly, boring."
1,Rotten,"When ""Love"" works, Noé achieves a lulling, melancholic frenzy about sex and memory, but the foundation isn't strong enough to make his movie ever seem more than a stereoscopic fermata: one envelope-pushing note held way too long."
0,Fresh,"Visualmente espetacular (...),  repleto de momentos que surgem poticos de to evocativos."
0,Fresh,"The joy of Fargo is that everything that goes wrong does so in a perfectly realized universe of icebound Minnesotan understatement, a landscape so muffled by snow and Scandinavian-bred, low-affect courtesy that even murderous passion comes out goofy."
0,Fresh,"Where are the scenes of the undead feasting on entrails? The atmosphere of creeping dread? The subversive satire? But take Forster's movie on its own terms and it delivers pulse-pounding, adrenaline-pumping excitement."
0,Fresh,"Davis is the main attraction of the movie. She looks like a delicate flower, but she's smart and sarcastic!"
1,Rotten,"A refracted glimpse of American suburbia through the eyes of three pre-teens grappling with grief, reprisal and loneliness, the film boasts some great adolescent performances but can't overcome a rigidly partitioned structure and tonal inconsistency."
1,Rotten,"I'm not his manager, but I wonder if Kevin Spacey would profit from laying off the sardonic, disaffected, emotionally numb characters for a while. They're criminally easy for him at this point in his career."
0,Fresh,Definitely one of my favorite films of the last five years.
1,Rotten,"There are also the usual scenes in which cars climb telephone poles, characters do cartwheels in midair, dogs drive ice cream wagons and Keenan Wynn blusters."
0,Fresh,Hero is without question the year's most beautiful film.
0,Fresh,The film treats the subject of the investigation with the utmost respect and gives it the weight that it deserves.
1,Rotten,Has aged about as well as a banana in the sweltering sun...
0,Fresh,"The plot is light and inconsequential, but for a slice of steampunk noir-lite, it's great fun."
0,Fresh,It's an arcade-game romp done with flair.
0,Fresh,"With this gritty, savvy and finely wrought drama, J.C. Chandor establishes himself as one of the most exciting directors of his generation."
0,Fresh,A tired retread that a well-paid lead actor walks away from? Doesn't sound like screen magic in the making. But darned if Mr. Waters and his writers didn't pull it off. With a lot of help from a pinch-hitting Mom and a teenage Disney remake veteran.
1,Rotten,"It's well-constructed and acted, but mainly just left me feeling like I needed a shower after an exercise in voyeurism surrounding an event that's still hard to watch."
0,Fresh,A welcome return to the Western and more specifically to the romantic West.
1,Rotten,The Walk is a minor Zemeckis film.
1,Rotten,Winkler's writing works too hard to achieve the frothy quality that he attempts.
0,Fresh,The animators lure us in with clever jokes and ingenious visuals and then sucker-punch us by revealing the characters' surprising emotional depths.
0,Fresh,"You can't look away, but it's almost painful to watch."
1,Rotten,The astonishing footage of apes in their natural environment is made perfectly accessible and then nearly undone by a narration track that plays to the audience's basest desires for gag-inducing cuteness.
1,Rotten,"Where the original grounded itself within its conceit, Ralph Breaks the Internet's much broader one inevitably consumes it."
0,Fresh,"Glorious artwork, stirring music and a compact story line make this film a winner."
0,Fresh,The last act overcomes a sluggish middle and is as thrilling as this franchise ever gets.
0,Fresh,"The actors appear to be having a grand time. And when Parker isn't driving them at full gallop, their merriment is highly contagious."
0,Fresh,Movies like this are beyond criticism.
1,Rotten,"Its linear plot proceeds step by obvious step, following an anti-hero who is alone in possessing any twinkle of subjectivity."
0,Fresh,"That being said, the movie is not without its flaws, but all in all, it's a beautiful, moving production."
1,Rotten,I'm grateful that I (presumably) never have to see any more of these ever again.
0,Fresh,"This is a ride, a carefully crafted experience, and it is precisely because it is so immersive and controlled that I would recommend it."
1,Rotten,"[It] does pick a solid lead actor in Dominic Cooper, whose impressive performance does a lot to distract from the story problems and strange tone shifts."
0,Fresh,Theo James has gotten good at playing this one kind of protagonist; he's like the exact midpoint between all of the overwhelmed-but-capable disaster movie heroes you've ever seen.
0,Fresh,"Hamburg's serio comedy is a leap forward compared with his former banal work, but dealing with male camaraderie, it suffers from lack of chemistry between Rudd and his fiancee, making it all the more apparent that he has better time with his buddy Segel"
0,Fresh,"The Favourite marks [Lanthimos'] most dynamic work yet in its dissection of class structure and gender politics, doling out pity and hilarity with equal aplomb."
1,Rotten,Things get so bad at points during 'Man on a Ledge' that you might be inclined to join the more nasty elements among the sidewalk onlookers and shout 'Jump already!'
0,Fresh,"Though it's nothing you haven't seen before, it's so artfully made and skillfully executed that you won't care a bit."
1,Rotten,"What we care about in Assassination Tango is the tango, not the assassination."
0,Fresh,Backgrounds are crammed with detail and sly visual gags that warrant a second or even third viewing.
1,Rotten,"Offers decent enough thrills, but a few too many of them feel a mite cheap."
0,Fresh,"The mother lode of the horror genre, this German Expressionist movie is directed by Robert Wiene and presents a full smorgasbord of pop-eyed terror, lunatics, murderers and possessed somnambulists in its eerie shadows."
0,Fresh,"Heinzerling combines Noriko's drawings with contemporary footage to create a story that isn't only a tale of creative minds, but an honest love story."
0,Fresh,"The third major screen version of the story, has much to recommend it."
1,Rotten,"Its central gimmick runs out of steam pretty quickly, causing the story logic to crumble and the suspense to dwindle."
0,Fresh,"""Ernest & Celestine"" draws on plenty of classics, animated and otherwise, for inspiration, but the film manages to be delightful on its own offbeat terms."
0,Fresh,Someone Great takes the romantic comedy down new paths.
1,Rotten,"It all sounds rather grandiose, but it's hardly a surprising view from folks accustomed to thinking big."
1,Rotten,"[This] movie symbolizes the continued erosion of the Merchant Ivory brand into an entity producing films that belong on cable television, not in movie theaters."
1,Rotten,"There's some sharply written dialogue, and a few strong performances in supporting roles. But much of the action onscreen doesn't ring true."
0,Fresh,"When Nicole Kidman has full control of her facial muscles she is unrivaled in her ability to play cold, distant emotionally scarred bitches. Its a marvelous performance. That said, the film itself can be so anguished that you will need counseling upon exit"
0,Fresh,The mixture of old school crime caper and Looney Tunes-style slapstick lends it a pleasant retro feel for adults even if kids might find Surly a poor relation of the acorn-obsessed squirrel Scrat in the Ice Age series.
1,Rotten,The film largely evades any perspectives that might question the institutions that put our soldiers in harm's way.
1,Rotten,"While it's impressive in scope and special effects, it comes across as a mish-mash of sci-fi films -- everything from Dune to Star Wars to Battlefield Earth."
0,Fresh,An enjoyable distraction that's thankfully not afraid to be a bit more adult about matters of sexual attraction.
0,Fresh,"One of the best things in this new film is the music. You can feel it in your chest, your head and almost believe you are in their territory."
0,Fresh,"As the film sprawls across nighttime Berlin, fluidly moving and moving and moving, it's impossible not to feel a giddy sense of awe. Which, various criticisms aside, is certainly one reason to go to the movies."
0,Fresh,Hope Davis shines!
0,Fresh,The first film felt like a blender set to 'high'; the second sits down and contemplates what came splattering out.
0,Fresh,"[The] animated sequences, candy-colored and typically comic-booky over the top, only underscore, by stark contrast, the film's unvarnished depiction of teenage life as hard, confusing, and awkward."
0,Fresh,"Gerald Di Pego's intelligent, articulate screenplay provides plenty of opportunities for both intellectual and emotional swordplay in this ultimately gentle romantic comedy"
0,Fresh,High school kids solve crime; violence and language.
0,Fresh,"An assault on reason, logic and complex characterisation, but in an enjoyable way, like a slightly less camp dramatisation of the Village People's finest ship-based sing-song."
0,Fresh,"Although we get to see the same story again, the perspective changes with the performance of Moore. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,Fun little dark comedy from the days when DeVito still knew how to make a dark comedy fun.
1,Rotten,"No doubt the concept is fascinating, but too bad the movie itself fails to capitalise the potential."
0,Fresh,A few lively song-and-dance numbers + the voice talents of Jamie Foxx and will.i.am earn an extra star.
0,Fresh,"...there's a nifty, nasty little grindhouse pic at the heart of Traffik (it could use a new title that's more on point, like, say, Racists Ruined My Proposal!)"
0,Fresh,"A mostly absorbing tale of the hunter being subverted into the hunted, No Country For Old Men deserves to be lauded for its gripping, relentless thrills rather than its flawed denouement."
0,Fresh,"Blessed with candid subjects, a sure sense of emotional honesty and an eye for drawing out the power of small moments, Opper has produced a memorable, deeply affecting film."
0,Fresh,"It's a superb piece of acting about acting, and a harbinger of great things to come in this young actor's future."
0,Fresh,The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson...
1,Rotten,The bad news is not limited to Arquette's annoying accent.
0,Fresh,"The movie is aimed at teenagers, but like all good comedies, it will appeal to anyone who has a sense of humor and an ear for the ironic."
1,Rotten,"We Are Still Here is more or less a 90-minute tribute to the superior haunted house features that came before. Great poster, though."
0,Fresh,"While I will always hate Bay, this is actually an okay movie."
0,Fresh,"""Strange Magic"" is a movie that's easier to appreciate and admire than to actually swoon over. Not bad for an orphan."
1,Rotten,"Vanilla Sky is a long, complex, ambitious thriller that doesn't quite work."
0,Fresh,"This proves to be more than just a ghost story, as the twists turn it into a full-blown mystery that stirs up memories of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca."
1,Rotten,"Into The Woods is excellent proof that we, as a society, need to rise up and stop Rob Marshall from directing a movie ever again."
0,Fresh,It's best to just relax and enjoy the Party.
0,Fresh,"A spellbinding mess of Greco-Roman, Irish and Native American myth, revisionist chic and theatrical tradition."
1,Rotten,"There are very few surprises, pleasant or otherwise, in the film's interminable two-hour running time."
0,Fresh,"This modest, warmhearted character study is carried by a solid lead performance from Anthony LaPaglia, who plays a man unable to express his feelings through anything but underhanded snark."
0,Fresh,A slightly underwhelming sequel to the great Escape from New York. But not without its cheesy only-in-the-1990s charm.
0,Fresh,"Believe the hype. As a sci-fi thrill ride, and a provocative commentary on xenophobia, District 9 is definitely all that it's cracked up to be."
0,Fresh,"Com um estilo marcante j no filme de estria, os irmos Coen criam uma obra noir tensa, envolvente e que faz do absurdo uma de suas principais armas."
0,Fresh,"Epic, thrilling 3-D adventure sequel is outstanding."
1,Rotten,The shift in focus defuses what might have been fresh in the story.
0,Fresh,"With first-time director Paul Dano at the helm, Wildlife benefits from a stand-out performance from actress Carey Mulligan."
1,Rotten,Feels like an outline spun by an ambitious Hollywood executive rather than anything resembling real life.
1,Rotten,"We never remain long enough with any one person to get more than a cursory idea of their story, and so over the course of the film's 140 minute runtime, we end up with a sense of the crisis as a tragedy, yes, but a choral, abstract one."
0,Fresh,It's the kind of movie that is both unsettling and inspiring.
0,Fresh,"Although the style of László Nemes' Holocaust drama at times threatens to overwhelm the substance, the movie has a cumulative power that's difficult to shake."
1,Rotten,The Transporter Refuelled has a good core but not much more.
0,Fresh,Bob Fosse captures the atmosphere incredibly with a multi-layered musical that continues to hold up over the years
0,Fresh,"If a syllable could kill (and it can, can't it?), the movie would be the Texas Chainsaw Massacre of the stiletto-heeled and dagger-toothed."
1,Rotten,"Duke appears to be aiming for a Tyler Perry-style mix of the taboo and the saintly, but his touch is so leaden that one ends up giggling, not weeping."
1,Rotten,"Plod, plod, plod."
0,Fresh,Y'all NEED to see this film. Just be prepared to get emotional and mourn the loss of a man who devoted his life to being kind.
0,Fresh,"[I]'s not about aliens: it's about us. This isn't science fiction: It's a bleak fantasy about karma being a bitch. It's about collective cultural guilt. Looked at from that angle, Battle: Los Angeles is fascinating."
0,Fresh,"When the character suffers, you feel it, even if it's removed in a way."
1,Rotten,Unbelievable.
1,Rotten,"Jennifer Beals shouldn't feel bad. She is a natural talent, she is fresh and engaging here, and only needs to find an agent with a natural talent for turning down scripts."
1,Rotten,"The Frank Miller Universe at its most reductionist, self-parodying and content-free … There is nothing at stake … only a pointless, shapeless exercise in wildly veering moods and styles."
0,Fresh,"Despite under-imagined action sequences, the movie's intentional humor and Tom Hiddleston's well-played Loki save it from mediocrity."
0,Fresh,The Lego Movie 2 ups the ante on the first hit with its elaborate setup and eye-popping new characters.
0,Fresh,"Those looking for a heartwarming, funny and adventurous story about wild animals will certainly find it in Two Brothers."
0,Fresh,"It seems to have hopes of becoming a science fiction classic. It's not -- it's just a popcorn movie -- but it's loud, smashing fun, if you accept it as a high-tech piece of silliness."
1,Rotten,A woefully thin and pointless musical comedy.
0,Fresh,"This is definitely a film to watch - but only as part of a discourse on what love is. Despite a very committed vision and understatedly solid actors, somehow this never quite feel like what Emily Brontë intended."
0,Fresh,"If you're not weak of stomach, heart, or mind, go see Serial Mom."
0,Fresh,"A rousing, old-fashioned biopic of patriotic showman George M. Cohan, played with energy and gusto by Jimmy Cagney in his only Oscar-winning performance."
1,Rotten,"I like Stiller and Wilson, but they need better material than these witless mainstream flicks."
0,Fresh,"Where the format comes into its own is in intense, action-packed territory. An Unexpected Journey's battle sequences are especially striking."
0,Fresh,"Travel from Mars to Earth is an amazing feat, but not much more remarkable than reviving a sitcom that had been dead for a third of a century."
0,Fresh,As thought-provoking as it is hilarious.
1,Rotten,"Director Andrzej Bartkowiak wants to give us the ultimate sugar rush, but all we get is the rush with none of the sugar and the come down is headache inducing."
0,Fresh,"Billy Elliot es una oda al espritu humano, as como un recordatorio divertido y sincero de la importancia de luchar por los sueos"
0,Fresh,Burton pulls back on his traditional Goth goofiness to give these characters and their story the respect they deserve.
0,Fresh,Jake Gyllenhaal continues his streak of brilliant performances the Academy will likely ignore.
0,Fresh,"A spry romp through the seven years leading up to the drafting of the Communist Manifesto, Raoul Peck's biopic of Karl Marx's early years feels like a mix between a prestige BBC drama and a Marx For Dummies primer."
0,Fresh,This Chucky lacks the potent fear-inducing malevolence that the previous installments had.
0,Fresh,Osgood Perkins has managed to single himself out as a horror director with a unique and terrifying voice.
0,Fresh,Chronically Metropolitan is a coming-of-age dramedy but it doesn't come without some cynicism.
1,Rotten,This would have worked better as a short documentary.
0,Fresh,For all its attention to John's victimization -- and exacting an emotional response from its audience -- the film takes a surprisingly schizophrenic view of capital punishment.
0,Fresh,"[Eliza] Hittman's lighting - with cinematography by Hélène Louvart - pacing, and camera angles are taut and lyrical."
1,Rotten,"Adkins, Van Damme, and Lundgren turn in far more compelling work than they did in their last film together, Expendables 2, though maybe that's not saying much."
0,Fresh,"As a sweet comedy, it's enjoyable enough, as long as you don't expect it to carry the burden of an entire ethnic or sexual community on its shoulders."
1,Rotten,"There is no redemption, no surcease, and as the film ends the barbarity continues. This film made me intensely uncomfortable, but that was its intention."
0,Fresh,A cinematic Columbine filled with wanton carnage designed to validate the bloodlust of every ostracized loser stuck in a dead-end job and daydreaming of evening the score by going postal.
0,Fresh,"In a world choked with animated films -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- it's hard to be either original or great. Yet director Gore Verbinski has done both -- and without 3-D..."
1,Rotten,"Grandma's Boy is an Adam Sandler comedy without Adam Sandler, which is kind of like getting a root canal without the dentist."
0,Fresh,Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago.
1,Rotten,One must ask why sequels such as this come to be.
0,Fresh,"While the film doesn't stray a lot from its genre roots thanks to its take no prisoners attitude and largely because of Brody, Polley and especially Chanéac it's always easy to watch."
1,Rotten,Every early attempt at proving this won't be a standard teen flick is eventually negated by a cop-out later on in the film.
0,Fresh,"Brie's performance is powerful and the film's editing does a superb job of mixing Sarah's obscured perception with reality, succeeding in offering an unsettling look into the mind of someone who suffers from a severe mental illness."
1,Rotten,"It's not a feast, it's a quick fix. You want bombs? You want quips? You want tech? You got 'em. Now go away . . . and come back next July."
1,Rotten,An unexceptional if inoffensive movie with some lovely music.
0,Fresh,"As Folman makes peace with his past, he also makes a strong argument against war. Waltz with Bashir is a haunted and haunting film, one that resonates long after the final fadeout."
0,Fresh,"Despicable Me 2 is not what I'd call a 'good' film, but it's funny enough to make up for it."
0,Fresh,The film could be sharper and tighter - ten minutes and at least four endings shorter - but the moments of success in What Keeps You Alive out-weigh the film's faults.
0,Fresh,A reasonably suspenseful thriller that may require a second viewing to iron out the complex plot.
1,Rotten,"The silly recurrence of an early-movie villain at the end may make you say, 'Hell to the no!' for the first time, and the same goes for the awkward emotional coda."
0,Fresh,Who DOESN'T know how lethal Halle Berry can be behind the wheel?
0,Fresh,"Disney may be squeezing the franchise to the fullest, but as long as it continues to produce Star Wars movies of this quality, I doubt many people will complain. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"A melodrama with a comic touch, Big Eyes, is not meant to be a masterpiece, rather, an entertaining piece of art."
0,Fresh,"The down-to-earth quality of the human dynamics, which are completely absent of superhuman behavior, give the characters a credibility that allows audiences to believe their lives in these treacherous waters are at stake."
1,Rotten,"If you love this movie, you're figuratively obeying the title's injunction."
1,Rotten,"Maybe I could say that if Christopher Guest rounded up his usual troupe and did a verbatim, shot-for-shot remake, it would be one of the funniest films of the year."
1,Rotten,"Shadow Recruit isn't awful, but it doesn't possess the depth nor the thrills to join the ranks of Bond, Bourne, or even TV's Bauer."
0,Fresh,"A timeless portrait of two individuals' awkward, euphoric first encounter with love."
1,Rotten,I'm selling my shares in Dell and socking it all into Tylenol as soon as possible.
0,Fresh,"Military Wives is very much that sort of British picture - funny, feelgood but with a generous dollop of heart-wringing emotion, too."
0,Fresh,Leisurely paced and very easy to watch.
0,Fresh,"Bigger and even richer than the terrific 2010 hit animation, this sequel is also quite possibly the best action-adventure movie of the year."
0,Fresh,"This movie is short on nuance, but at least it treats Lovelace with a respect she didn't often find in her difficult life."
0,Fresh,"Any time Bullock and Thornton share the screen, Our Brand Is Crisis jumps to life."
0,Fresh,Bradley Cooper makes an outstanding directorial debut and Lady Gaga proves herself a movie star in this electrifying remake of an oft-told show-business tale.
0,Fresh,"While a little overblown and overly long, a wide range of people will find at least something to like here."
1,Rotten,An almost inconceivable disaster.
0,Fresh,[Kevin] Smith needs to focus on this genre for a change.
0,Fresh,"Teplitzky has structured his film masterfully, as the way this tale is told, intertwining between various flashbacks, is completely seamless."
0,Fresh,"There's a fine line sometimes between daring and ridiculous, and although Austrian director Michael Haneke's drama The Piano Teacher comes perilously close to the hysterical edge, it is also a shocking movie."
0,Fresh,The Bill Murray Stories: Life Lessons Learned From a Mythical Man addresses the very real title star's amusingly bizarre habit of casually barging into regular lives.
0,Fresh,"For any American even mildly ignorant of the rich, complex legacy of Civil Rights within our decidedly disunited country, this should be mandatory viewing."
0,Fresh,This is the sort of film that warrants a second viewing.
0,Fresh,"The success of any biopic rests squarely on the shoulders of the actor playing the subject, and Natalie Portman harnesses every bit of the strength and fragility she displayed in her Oscar-winning role in 2010's Black Swan to astounding effect."
0,Fresh,"What emerges from this delightful, brief documentary doesn't debunk Vermeer's genius, but certifies it."
1,Rotten,I spent most of the film's 148 minutes just wanting to slap these women because I grew weary of their whining.
1,Rotten,"Once the screaming begins, so will your laughing"
1,Rotten,It's consistent with the duller examples of Hollywood's animated output.
1,Rotten,"My dog has the common sense to know his limitations. But then he's probably got an IQ point or 50 on poor Andy, if Hot Rod is indicative of how deep the waters of Lake Samberg go."
1,Rotten,"Snyder is slavishly reverential to the source work. Too faithful, to the point that film's greatest irony is that it lacks an identity of its own."
1,Rotten,"David Green structures the film in the mold of the time-honored boys-into- men military exercise, but don't go looking for The Sands of Iwo Jima."
0,Fresh,"You're still left breathless, wowed and wanting for more."
0,Fresh,"The movie isn't as dynamic as it could have been, but it gets to the core of what big, important social change means - and how little glory there is in ground work."
1,Rotten,"The best thing about ""Sundown"" is that it's too dumb to be offensive."
0,Fresh,"Lucas has delivered new worlds, characters, and creatures but has left in little of the humor that sparkled throughout the original Star Wars."
1,Rotten,"Middle-School boys are the target audience for the shifting personalities, robot minions and building-smashings. People above that age will mostly just endure it all..."
1,Rotten,"Woodley's a first-year Girl Scout surrounded by troop leaders, making action scenes stiff and tedious."
1,Rotten,"While Pride does have a lot to like about it, including a fantastic ensemble and a positive, uplifting message, sadly the film is smothered in a little too much excess, which in turn makes it not work as well as it might have."
0,Fresh,"A first-rate, intelligent thriller/courtroom drama of the kind we see all too seldom these days."
1,Rotten,The result is a tad predictable.
0,Fresh,"A complex portrait emerges of two people, without revealing or settling too much of anything."
1,Rotten,This movie will satisfy Reeves fans in search for a good-looking action flick.
0,Fresh,"[Ramirez's] performance works as a miniature study of machismo, which can be both a show-offy radiance and a kind of shade-a safe, sheltering rock for a man to hide behind."
0,Fresh,No one gives a dull performance and the story is compelling enough to keep you hooked from beginning to end.
0,Fresh,"OK, so we never have much doubt about what will happen, but Fincher pulls out all the visual stops to crank up the heat in this tale of five people in a Manhattan house on one dark and stormy night."
0,Fresh,Channing and Stiles share an appropriately uneasy chemistry together.
0,Fresh,Jack O'Connell is electrifying.
1,Rotten,Adam Sandler has succumbed to the Eddie Murphy syndrome. He's afflicted with the belief that we can't get enough of him.
0,Fresh,A satisfying and original picture.
0,Fresh,A genuinely funny road movie that sees two fine actors dealing with personal and global issues in a fresh and emotionally engaging way.
0,Fresh,The kids are charming and the supporting cast lift this comedy from above its direct-to-video ambitions.
0,Fresh,Imagine it: Liz Lemon and Michael Scott. Married with kids. I want to go to there.
1,Rotten,"Blame the paintings! Its darkly satirical, ironic and over the top, and leaves a bitter taste."
1,Rotten,Only Tomei's thoughts sound like actual thinking.
0,Fresh,"Indebted as director Jeff Tremaine is to Artaud's Theater of Cruelty and the works of Luis Buuel, ""Jackass 3D"" remains surprisingly accessible."
0,Fresh,"The pleasure of seeing Arnie back with a (large) gun in his hand, cracking the odd joke at his own and his team's expense, and all the collected weight of a thousand years of action hero experience to call on. Van Damme it, it's a blast"
1,Rotten,Fantastic Four is actually very true to its source material - often literally so - but generally misses the spirit entirely.
0,Fresh,"The stripped-down production looks more like a play than a movie, but all the actors do a decent job with a script which turns increasingly preposterous at every turn."
1,Rotten,This film begins well... but after a while it becomes way too ordinary. [full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"In terms of dramatic tension, Best in Show is more compelling than a lot of formulaic sports movies."
0,Fresh,Journalistic scandal story best for older teens.
0,Fresh,"Real Steel has the kind of joyful silliness of a film like Face/Off or Mission Impossible, coupled with a good dose of genuine heart."
1,Rotten,"Landscape trumps character in The Way Back, just as the Siberian and Mongolian wilderness overwhelms the seven gulag escapees at the heart of Peter Weir's 1940-set film."
1,Rotten,"If you find hedge funds hard to wrap your head around, the movie ""Human Capital"" won't do much to ease the confusion."
1,Rotten,"This was not a sequel that anybody needed, outside of the accountants. And there's another already planned."
0,Fresh,"The film is not only a feel-good affair, though it certainly is that - it has something of significance to say."
1,Rotten,Words cannot possibly do justice to what a total monstrosity this film is.
1,Rotten,"Running With Scissors is alternately grating and boring, as deadly a combo as one could imagine sitting through for two unendurable hours."
1,Rotten,"Class conflict, broken hearts, self-sacrifice and the muddy, senseless folly of war are all lightly touched upon in a starchy, old-fashioned drama."
1,Rotten,"Overall, an underwhelming effort."
0,Fresh,"...it is [Baldwin's] voice that is the greatest takeaway here, Baldwin's passionate and deeply considered arguments irrefutable. Peck's painstaking work is as powerful in content as DuVernay's ""13th"" and a poetic tribute to Baldwin's life."
1,Rotten,"Cedric the Entertainer inhabits Kramden's role comfortably, but there's no rage or bite in his acting."
1,Rotten,"I found it grandiloquent and emotionally vacant, notwithstanding some hilarious sendups of the period's pretensions."
1,Rotten,"And while Meryl Streep's performance is largely worthy of its laurels ... the film around it is much harder to forgive. Beyond Streep, Sophie's Choice is little more than a tediously assembled WWII drama of interminable length."
0,Fresh,One of the happiest surprises of this woman on the verge delight is that Pippa Lee's private lives are not what you'd think they are.
0,Fresh,"Even a 4-year old can see the twists and turns coming a mile away, but everyone is so likable"
0,Fresh,"The combat scenes alone make it a must-see, but I sometimes wished I could fast-forward through the rest."
0,Fresh,"Slowly paced and almost painfully detailed, Andrew Dominik's film more than fulfills the promise of Chopper (2000), another study of the violence inherent in celebrity."
0,Fresh,It looks great and moves well; it's exciting and funny in all the right places.
0,Fresh,Despite its frustratingly crude formal construction proves an equally sorrowful and stirring portrait of selflessness in the face of tragedy.
0,Fresh,"The funniest, most unassumingly subversive teen movie since 2000's Bring It On."
0,Fresh,"It's an accomplished potboiler entertainment, as calculated and clever as the stories Irving spins to stay afloat in the growing sea of his own lies."
1,Rotten,The brash English filmmaker has made a film about a winner that is a loser.
0,Fresh,Ultimately the acting and character interactions are what makes this movie fun.
0,Fresh,"Though 'The Dark Knight' may be the better, shrewder film, its sequel improbably turns out to be more personal"
1,Rotten,"Devolves into a predictable man-against-nature, and man-against-fellow man, affair."
1,Rotten,"In The Black Dahlia, narrative strands tangle and wither, and minor characters clutter the plot."
1,Rotten,"Greg Heffley... will learn some further lessons about not being a preteen jerk, but his audience will still be encouraged to find hilarity in crotch injuries and budding homophobia."
1,Rotten,"Rarely do the well-financed wizards at Walt Disney Pictures cook up a movie this badly written, acted, and directed."
0,Fresh,"Unsuprisingly, Robinson never really gets anywhere either, but her film at least gives a convincing flavour of the time."
0,Fresh,"$90,000,000, a hundred, whatever they spent: this is a taut thriller built for audiences but also one of the most expensive experimental movies ever made. It's a thrill ride, but a work by a visual artist at the extremes of his acuity."
1,Rotten,Collette never gives a less than watchable performance but she is asked to overplay her hand with diminishing returns.
0,Fresh,"Under the Sea 3D is one of the best of the genre. If it doesn't serve oysters, per se, this submarine wonder offers marvels in abundance."
1,Rotten,"Although the picture consumes only 90 minutes, it somehow seems draggy, for the reason that everything other than the scenes with the three principals seems extraneous and tends to clog the progression of the tale."
0,Fresh,"Bigger in scope than the original, the film's nonstop mayhem includes cartoonish battles, geysers of CGI blood and seemingly impossible stunts, with the geriatric gang of beloved icons placed centre stage for maximum thrills."
1,Rotten,"It's comprehensive, but that doesn't make it complete."
1,Rotten,"Look, let's not kid ourselves. Every third person on the planet will go to see this movie, and they will find exactly what they seek, nothing more but certainly nothing less. It's that nothing more part that ultimately disappoints."
1,Rotten,Cult director Takashi Miike's English-language Sukiyaki Western Django has style to burn but self-destructs like a wildfire as it attempts to spoof spaghetti westerns -- a passé endeavor -- and Sergio Corbucci's Django in particular.
1,Rotten,A lifeless piece of work that sits there on the screen and doesn't even take the most tentative steps to engage the viewer.
1,Rotten,"Morris' choice of title may be ripe with ironic intent, but the film is what it is: an arrogant, obscene, inexcusable example of tabloid exploitation."
0,Fresh,Color Out of Space explodes off the screen with luscious vitality like every trailer and marketing still assures.
1,Rotten,[A] disjointed and clumsily made biopic of rock icon Jimi Hendrix.
1,Rotten,"While the world's desperate cries for more sequels to The Santa Clause go unanswered, Universal Pictures brings us the next best thing."
1,Rotten,The movie's winsome artificiality may drive you bananas.
1,Rotten,There's nothing new or noteworthy here.
1,Rotten,"The film badly needs an edge, one that isn't borrowed from a film from more than a decade ago."
0,Fresh,"Sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. And with The Dark Knight Rises, Nolan's masterful coda, he has done just that."
0,Fresh,"In a remarkable way [Jumanji is] developing a different epic that, without a doubt, will bring more productions as soon as possible. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"The material is beautifully put together, and it is powerful."
0,Fresh,"Incredible by name and incredible by nature -- brilliantly acted, wonderfully animated and hysterically funny throughout, this is one of the best films of the year. Unmissable."
1,Rotten,The big problem with the premise is that jealousy is not funny... the film follows the same plot as all 'outrageous wedding' movies.
1,Rotten,"Often it's a thin line between genius and madness, and director Danny Boyle just tips the balance the wrong way with this psychological heist thriller."
1,Rotten,"As is, this tale of friendship and companionship between man and man's best friend is bogged down in weepy cliches ripped straight from the Art of Making the Audience Cry handbook."

1,Rotten,"Look at Richard Dreyfuss on the poster, weep for him, and then rent something else."
1,Rotten,"I'd claim it was a blatant rip-off of Kinji Fukasaku's fantastic 2000 cult masterwork Battle Royale, but then I'd have to try and compare this insipidly inert monstrosity with that explosively sensationalistic classic."
0,Fresh,... Likely to be one of the year's best comedies.
0,Fresh,A truly chilling movie.
1,Rotten,A disposable film. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"It's derivative and drowning in stagnant machismo, but stark enough to work."
0,Fresh,"[VIDEO] Trading on hockey's blood-splattering brutality as a ripe source for comic possibilities, ""Goon"" is a good-hearted sports comedy with a romantic left hook."
0,Fresh,The film captures Vreeland's perhaps unwitting philosophical integrity just as much as it drowns us in the exuberance of her work.
0,Fresh,"If nothing else, it'll make you think twice about dropping a Cornetto wrapper on any English heritage site - or not without checking over your shoulder first."
1,Rotten,It fails at romance and comedy. It fails to make the lead characters interesting and their love affair believable. And it fails to develop a consistent tone that would enable viewers to suspend their disbelief.
1,Rotten,"In settling for caricatures and contrivance, Pushing Tin is closer to the sitcom."
1,Rotten,"The preponderance of middle-aged men doesn't help: world-weary, seasoned villains they may be, but you wouldn't bank on any of them breaking into a sprint without pulling something."
0,Fresh,"From the past to the present to the future, from savagery to civilization to a kind of cybernetic autism. Babel does what a movie can do. It whisks us away."
0,Fresh,"The spirit of genre-busting, racial-stereotype deconstruction is so strong and heady in Undercover Brother that it's hard not to completely fall for its comic charms."
0,Fresh,Expect this to emerge as the best comic-horror pic of 2013.
1,Rotten,It's just a series of nicely shot and over-bright sets with the cast blocking your view of the background.
0,Fresh,"What crystallizes the film, especially for veterans of the Star Wars franchise is the sense of history and consequence from the last film in the storyline."
1,Rotten,About the only redeeming aspect of the entire film is Dawson's performance.
1,Rotten,"The movie has amusing moments, but they feel prepackaged with everything but a sitcom laugh track."
1,Rotten,Anti-Democrat docu has strong political agenda; violence.
1,Rotten,"Mr. Judge has done better, more pointed work before, notably in the cult-favorite workplace comedy Office Space."
0,Fresh,"The Reader trips over itself now and then, but it remains wonderfully acted and beautifully realized. And it has something profound to say about shame, confidence and justice."
0,Fresh,"Whether watching Kirk and Sulu skydive from space, a rural Mid-West dotted with vast interstellar towers, or Kirk do battle with a very ill-tempered beastie on a frozen moon, it's hard not to gape in wonder."
1,Rotten,"It's a hollow attempt at modernisation, and quickly grows dull. Watson's big dilemma - whether to quit his life with Holmes for marriage to lovely Mary has, at heart, all the depth of a Wham! song."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately too cautious for even a Valley of the Dolls insider expose. It lambasts these walking movie biz clichés, but everyone's gotta get a happy-enough ending."
0,Fresh,The potty-mouthed script deserves a parental warning and casts the only regretful shadow on an otherwise sterling popcorn adventure...
1,Rotten,"The only thing to keep this effort from sinking completely, like a snitch with cement shoes, is Kevin Pollack's broad portrayal."
0,Fresh,"Zodiac has perhaps the most perfect tagline for a movie of its mannered intricacy in years, and an evocative, metaphorically-on-point poster to boot."
1,Rotten,"Kelly tries to gather so many ideas under this movie's umbrella: He has strong ideas about the necessity of compassion in everyday life. He wonders what awaits us after death. But he can't flesh out all of these ideas properly, or even haphazardly."
1,Rotten,"Rotten. Horrible. Watch it and you'll be ""trading films."""
1,Rotten,"Obviously, the hole in Dreamcatcher was a little too small thus allowing a lot of the bad aspects of the film to stick in the web along with the good."
0,Fresh,One terrifying scene involves the sewing up of Bauby's paralyzed eye. He can still out of it but can't blink to lubricate it. The scene's as scary as anything in a horror film.
0,Fresh,"A perceptive, bittersweet, warts-and-all portrayal that feels like a love letter to motherhood itself."
0,Fresh,"Marvelously smart, funny and entertaining."
0,Fresh,"What gives the series its force is not just its universality but also its particularity. These grown-ups may be Everyman, but they are also singular."
0,Fresh,A sensitive drama about the challenges idealists and people of great passion face within the family circle.
0,Fresh,"An ambitious work, thick with history and atmosphere and clearly haunted by the ghosts of an Australian past that remains, at least where cinema is concerned, fairly obscure."
0,Fresh,"Harrowing and heartbreaking, a nightmare dystopia that could almost be a documentary. This tough but essential film slyly asks us to consider what we owe children, not just our own but the world's."
0,Fresh,"It's a cross between ""Network"" and ""Silence of the Lambs."""
0,Fresh,"Where so many science fiction visions of the era have dated, this gritty creation of a depressed (and depressing) future... looks all the more real."
1,Rotten,"In a year that has given us some of the worst films of all time, this must surely rank as the worst -- and that's a hard thing to do opposite Master of Disguise."
0,Fresh,"More mature than Fatal Attraction, more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1/2 Weeks, Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema."
0,Fresh,"Toy Story 4 is a straight-up sequel with all your favorites returning - if nostalgia is more your thing, you know what to do."
0,Fresh,Jake Gyllenhaal shines but there is not a lot more to this journey into home grown psychotherapy.
0,Fresh,"While T2 may never become as iconic a film for those who lived through the first outing, it's definitely got the ability to become a firm-favourite for them... and a younger generation."
0,Fresh,Christian McKay's performance is an extraordinary immersion that rivals the legendary portrayals of icons in movies past.
0,Fresh,"This film is loaded with top acting talent. There is also plenty of action and the pace of the film is fast. There are strong characters and a breezy humor to lighten the mood. This is an enjoyable, entertaining summer film."
1,Rotten,"This is a film with neither heart nor mind. Adapted from Alice Hoffman's bestseller, it substitutes set pieces for drama and music for dialogue."
1,Rotten,The plot holes in this new XXX are XXXL - big enough to drive a tank through.
1,Rotten,"If you don't love to watch fashion shows and Vogue photoshoots and designer wedding planning, ""Sex and the City"" and its consumer-driven fantasy world may elicit little more than yawns."
0,Fresh,"In short, I enjoyed a beguiling bittersweet wallow."
1,Rotten,"Sadly though, nothing sticks and it's easily forgotten soon after you see it."
0,Fresh,"The film initiates as a social drama, but, from a point on, it transforms into claustrophobic, violent thriller, with the fog surrounding the boat being one of the most important factors in the shaping of this atmosphere"
0,Fresh,A deliberately paced thriller that quickens the pulse.
0,Fresh,...probably the most lavish car commercial you'll ever pay to see.
0,Fresh,"I knew no details and found myself caught up in the drama, even if parkas and goggles and wind-suppressed dialogue prevented me from understanding who was who at every turn."
1,Rotten,"While I recognise the truthful and splendid depiction, like the characters whose lives are depicted, I found the journey frustrating and difficult"
0,Fresh,A modern western starring a woman. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,The Yes Men are dissidents of such fearless ingenuity that you want to believe them at face value
0,Fresh,It's a thrashing good time.
1,Rotten,"In their natural pen and paint environment, Rocky and Bullwinkle shine. But they seem as dull as dishwater, and completely out of place, in a live action world. Hence, their Adventures never connect with viewers."
0,Fresh,"The aspects that make the film entertaining are not solely reduced to Quinn's central protagonist, but in [director Cathy] Yan's style, in collaboration with [cinematographer] Matthew Libatique. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"Even if the similarity to The Raid: Redemption is pure coincidence, Dredd 3D suffers greatly by comparison, as it fails to muster even half of the thrills of its predecessor."
0,Fresh,"As an exercise in style, it's diverting enough, but these mean streets are so well traveled that it takes someone like Eva Green to make the detour through them worth the trip."
0,Fresh,"An unusual one but a great one, it will have you asking questions about the true nature of love for some time afterwards."
0,Fresh,"A self-described ""niche"" brand, Birbiglia ambles around the stage and lands almost every joke while discussing ""late people"" versus ""on-time people,"" the challenge of scratching an itch while handcuffed, and how he became a Muppets villain."
1,Rotten,Goes for cheap and easy laughs way too frequently.
1,Rotten,"There are a few thoughtfully placed cameras and thrilling moments - Bruce Willis vs. a door, for one - but they're not nearly enough to make this self-conscious live-action comic book worthwhile."
0,Fresh,Director J.J. Abrams reaches for the stars...and mostly succeeds in getting there.
0,Fresh,A bold step forward in Bergman's analysis of human isolation.
0,Fresh,"The Waiting City is an immersive film, but also a contemplative one."
0,Fresh,"Fiennes adequately plays out his part as reader anti-climactically: Kross is a superb presence and much missed as the tragedy is played out. A serious, reflective film, with much subtlety at its heart. I hope it wins many awards."
0,Fresh,The Survivalist...is as terrific and as suspenseful a post-apocalyptic thriller as any I'll likely see this year.
0,Fresh,"One of the best pictures of the year...King of Kong is an uproarious, unsettlingly observant, and romantically biased documentary on the golden years of classic gaming."
0,Fresh,"There are moments of pleasure, humor and, yes, terror to be had here all the same."
0,Fresh,"There will be enough tears to fill a small inflatable pool, if not an ocean."
0,Fresh,"A sleek, slick war movie that works as an adrenaline-pumping action ride and as a great recruitment ad for the U.S. Navy."
0,Fresh,"""Mom and Dad"" is absolutely insane, and that's meant as a compliment."
0,Fresh,"slyly inverts all manner of gender conventions by having its narrative orientation gradually shift from a rather unengaging, anodyne hero to an altogether more dynamic and self-reliant heroine (the girl of the title)"
0,Fresh,"Jessica Chastain is relaxed with some actual lion cubs, and there's a bunny that should win an Oscar. But when the film pivots to the scared human beings down below, you get a hint of the weirder, tougher drama it might have been."
0,Fresh,"Miyazaki, the master animator and director of the enchanting Kiki's Delivery Service and Princess Mononoke, leads us through the looking glass as never before in Spirited Away."
0,Fresh,The Village is a film wherein the whole is sadly less than the sum of its eerie parts.
0,Fresh,"Content merely to continue the story...It answers the question ""Where are they now?"" but has no new thoughts or insights regarding the stories we know."
1,Rotten,"The film lost me there (it seems much more likely he would simply have left the baby in the car), so what follows didn't work for me either. But if you can buy the premise, you may enjoy this film."
0,Fresh,The film is beautifully shot and the performances are outstanding.
1,Rotten,"A good/bad way of seeing Bill Murray at its worst. It's him indulging in his laziest and most clueless tendencies, among them ignoring an obviously sloppy and dumb script that teems in Ugly Americanisms."
0,Fresh,Ari Aster is undoubtedly a master of his craft
0,Fresh,"Light and likable, Rio 2 doesn't dazzle us with originality, but it's attractive and it's fun, good enough reasons to go see it with the family."
0,Fresh,"Vulgar, ridiculous, offensive and absolutely riveting."
0,Fresh,Whilst it plays it safe and conventional in every way - it still somehow manages to entertain and engage for much of its run time
1,Rotten,"Tim Burton is like a billionaire fanboy who buys Bela Lugosi's Dracula cape: he has a perfect right to it, but that doesn't mean it looks good on him."
0,Fresh,"Upbeat and dramatically subdued,...it's characteristically handsome but uncharacteristically warm-hearted for a Scott film."
0,Fresh,"Even allowing for its slow start, wooden acting and wall-to-wall screaming, there is something ageless and primeval about King Kong that still somehow works."
0,Fresh,"Critics need a good laugh, too, and this too-extreme-for-TV rendition of the notorious MTV show delivers the outrageous, sickening, sidesplitting goods in steaming, visceral heaps."
0,Fresh,"The comic voice of Ricky Gervais comes through loud and clear, and Koepp's vision of a classical Hollywood comedy creates a confluence not only of great performers but of considerable wit and heart."
0,Fresh,"The best movie of 2004, edging out Sideways by a half-whisker."
0,Fresh,What happened to these women after the rape often shocks and disturbs them as much as the physical act itself.
0,Fresh,"""Rocketman"" has the pleasing aesthetic of a storybook jukebox musical but is punctuated with a piercing and unescapable sense of melancholy."
1,Rotten,"Veers all over the place in tone, especially in the scenes with Linney, who seems so much like a part of a different movie that I almost feel like she should only be mentioned in a different review."
0,Fresh,"It has a sharp and smart script, which plays with the genre's archetypes in order to develop unique situations. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"A manipulative, tearjerking thriller that, functioning as a sustained, anguished primal scream, is as emotionally devastating as any film, fiction or non-, released this year."
1,Rotten,"A contrived romantic comedy that can't decide whether to be charming or crass, ""50 First Dates"" tries to have it both ways and winds up achieving neither."
0,Fresh,"Through the years, [it's] become genre classic of its own."
0,Fresh,"After I Killed My Mother and Heartbeats, 23-year-old filmmaker Dolan gets even more ambitious with this epic-length romantic drama."
0,Fresh,"If Inside Man isn't the best movie Lee has done, it's probably the most purely exciting and enjoyable."
0,Fresh,"... one of Bay's better efforts to date, and a reminder that he remains an audience pull for a reason."
0,Fresh,"Oblivion is not perfect. But in a genre typically earmarked by superficial sturm und drang, there's an undercurrent of seriousness here that's refreshing"
1,Rotten,"Billy Crystal and Bette Midler play dysfunctional grandparents. Ouch, and twice ouch."
1,Rotten,"... slick and unpretentious, it wants nothing more than to be this year's Cellular -- and for maybe an hour or so it succeeds."
0,Fresh,This great film by Anthony Fabian tells this story through the eyes of a happy girl who grows into an outsider.
0,Fresh,"We've seen many an insider doc about films destroyed by their creators' chutzpah (Overnight, Lost in La Mancha), but what's most wrenching here is McQueen's displays of vulnerability and tenderness."
0,Fresh,What a blast!
1,Rotten,"Like another annoying stuffed animal, Ted just keeps on going and going and going . . ."
0,Fresh,"At least, the director's imagination remains as freeflowing and fervent as ever."
1,Rotten,"This is all too bland, too serious. The characters needed a significant injection of charisma."

1,Rotten,Born to be reviled.
0,Fresh,McEwan's genius is in allowing us to read the minds of his protagonists while reminding us that they cannot read each other's.
0,Fresh,"Seven years after Fuller's death, 24 years after its initial, botched release, and almost 60 years after V-E day, The Big Red One is finally here, in a form close to what Fuller intended."
1,Rotten,The dramatic structure of the possible conflict lacks inspiration. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,I Am Mother is undoubtedly a strong calling card with plenty on its mind. I just wish it had figured out what to do with it all.
0,Fresh,"Tough story but, hang in there, you'll cheer through your tears. This Dumbo is set in 1911 but for all intents and purposes, is as modern as this minute. Get out your handkerchiefs and enjoy yourselves!"
0,Fresh,"This whizzy and outrageously colourful family action romp is a visually breathtaking hybrid of animation and live action. The story may feel about as gripping as a videogame, but the film is pure eye candy."
0,Fresh,The Great Buster: A Celebration is a well-deserved cinematic tribute to Buster Keaton--one of the greatest silent comedy stars to have ever lived.
0,Fresh,Fans of Sex and the City will love the movie version.
0,Fresh,"It's not for everyone, but for me, it works."
0,Fresh,"""Michael Clayton"" is an up-to-the-minute allegory about the devastating power and malicious intent of a corporation that conceals its unethical actions with television commercials featuring close-ups of verdant nature."
0,Fresh,"Utterly stupid, not to mention rude, crude and irreverent in the extreme, A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas is exactly what the fans are hungering for."
1,Rotten,Watchable only because of the terrific stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen.
0,Fresh,"Resurrecting the Champ is authentic in its newsroom scenes, and appropriately concerned at how entertainment value trumps diligent reporting."
0,Fresh,The 3-D in Coraline is so low-key that I forgot it was there for much of the film. But maybe that's less a knock on the visuals than it is a compliment to the movie's ability to pull me into its zany world.
1,Rotten,"As one of the cops in this awful police thriller might say, ""There's nothing to see here, folks."""
0,Fresh,"Rademacher comes up with compellingly unfamiliar documentary footage. ... Firefights caught unvarnished and in the moment are harrowing because the cameraman himself is, well, harrowed."
0,Fresh,The winning aspect of this adaptation of a best-selling autobiography is in the director's management of the points of view.
1,Rotten,... watching this movie feels like plopping down on the couch as the series finale of a three-season miniseries begins and asking your roommate/significant other to give you a plot recap.
1,Rotten,"The writers may have figured The Tuxedo was tailor-made for a Chan/Hewitt pairing, but both may want to go back into the acting closet and pick out a film -- and a co-star -- that's a better fit."
1,Rotten,"With its stabs at profundity, Ad Astra seeks to merge the visionary grandeur of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the domestic drama of The Tree of Life. In the end, it doesn't get close to either. If you're seeking intelligent life, best to look elsewhere."
1,Rotten,"It's a 9/11 version of Life is Beautiful, or a Forrest Gump on antidepressants if you prefer. I prefer to vomit."
1,Rotten,Great to have Indy back. Wish he had more interesting stuff to do.
1,Rotten,"Perhaps you remember ""The Pick-Up Artist,"" the movie that single-handedly killed Molly Ringwald's career? That was another Toback production. ""Black and White,"" for all its arty pretensions and supposed shock value, doesn't break his losing streak."
1,Rotten,"Aesthetically, 'Iron Man 2' is a polished flick. Plot wise, it's almost as bad as 'Catwoman.'"
1,Rotten,"It's mix-and-match thriller MacGuffin clichés, but the movie barely pretends to be interested in this generic crime plot."
0,Fresh,"Mahalo, Alexander."
0,Fresh,"It is refreshing that Allen has shaken the Manhattan dust off his shoes and brought his filmmaking talents to Paris, London and, now, sunny Barcelona."
0,Fresh,"The ephemeral fireflies, which fascinate the children and accompany them everywhere, become a potent and lyrical symbol of the fragility, brevity and beauty of life."
0,Fresh,"Contrived, but beautifully cast and very entertaining."
0,Fresh,"It isn't a perfect movie, but it is a rewarding one, thanks largely to its superb cast and its willingness to stray into thought-provoking territory."
0,Fresh,"The film opened with a Star Wars-styled text scrolling, about how Austin Powers was frozen in 1967 and defrosted in the 90s to battle his nemesis Dr. Evil. After succeeding and banishing Evil, Powers settled down with his newly-wed wife Vanessa..."
0,Fresh,Onetime Saturday Night Live castmates Wiig and Rudolph make Annie and Lillian's friendship believable. Which is why Annie's shenanigans are sad -- and hilarious.

0,Fresh,The film strives at all moments to be faithful to the time period. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"The movie attempts to satirically explore the single-ladies world of bad dates, bad boyfriends, and bad bosses in the age of the #MeToo zeitgeist, but it does little more than nibble on the ubiquitous sexism that women experience."
0,Fresh,"Siberia is effectively well-paced, offers instances of tension, and doesn't cheat at the end."
0,Fresh,"Tiny Furniture is an observant portrait of those frustrating, entitled, complicated, unflattering moments when you suspect you could be everything but feel like nothing."
0,Fresh,"It's pretty formulaic stuff, but Levring has a good eye; it's a handsome film to look at."
0,Fresh,"This is consumerism run riot without a moral compass, not the redistribution of wealth, but its pure celebration."
0,Fresh,One of the problems with Denial is that it lacks the fire of conscience and replaces it with cool legal strategy.
0,Fresh,Arrives with the gale force winds that signal a major new international talent in Kim Ki-Duk.
1,Rotten,Feels like it could be the death knell of the middling monarch movie genre altogether.
1,Rotten,"Hyper-violent, mean, and more interesting in what it does wrong than what it does right"
0,Fresh,Raiders! is less an ode to the classic Spielberg film than a long form exploration of the fantastical manifestation of the inner lives of three young boys.
1,Rotten,One would presume that a behind-the-scenes look at the process of naming a new Pontiff would provide ample fodder for observational humor.
0,Fresh,There are many good reasons for going to see The Preacher's Wife.
1,Rotten,"Here is a movie in which old people are scary because they're senile and icky and incontinent and do baffling things. And they're, you know, so old and wrinkly."
1,Rotten,Likable but hopelessly folksy.
0,Fresh,The ability to compress such a hilariously complex story into 97 minutes of film is a tribute both to Wilde's astounding economy with words and Parker's mastery of his source material.
1,Rotten,There's little in the way of forward momentum until the final 30 minutes; stretching out this picture to longer than two hours was indefensible.
1,Rotten,"A film that's so recondite, it's barely there."
1,Rotten,Let's just call this movie the turkey that it is and move on to the next entry in this disappointing year of crappola at the movies.
0,Fresh,"The sustained force of Bruno Dumont's vision of existence as a swirl of brute instincts may not be easy to absorb, but it marks him as a major filmmaker."
1,Rotten,Cage delivers one of his most vibrant performances in years. But it's in the service of poorly choreographed action scenes and a script in which the Ryans' midlife crisis is set up by an awkward flashback.
0,Fresh,At the last... Footnote is so intelligently and deftly made that we are glad it exists.
0,Fresh,"The Hitman's Bodyguard is the kind of film you discover while channel surfing, stop on, and end up watching the whole thing without any previous intention."
0,Fresh,Baby Driver should be seen simply because it is such a bold and wonderful idea. That's why I kind of hate to say that it doesn't pull it off fully.
1,Rotten,"The Seinfeld of this year's Sundance, basically a movie with a lot of talking about nothing."
1,Rotten,"A big-screen adaptation of Men's Health and Fitness magazine, 300 is about as involving as sitting in front of a video game demo at Best Buy."
0,Fresh,The action sequences here are so big and so effortless that you wonder why Jerry Bruckheimer and all his imitators can't muster up the ability to do things half as well.
1,Rotten,"Beyond the fact that Hesher is a character to be despised instead of admired, Hesher is distanced from its characters and their situation in its apathy toward them."
1,Rotten,"It's too uneven for me to recommend. But, man, there is some good stuff here that I didn't expect that I wish had been saved for another better movie. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
0,Fresh,"Powerful and spellbinding, but not for the squeamish or the incurably romantic or people who don't want to know how difficult it can be to keep love alive."
1,Rotten,The only thing missing from this slight comedy of misunderstandings is Mr. Furley - and a scene set in the Regal Beagle.
1,Rotten,"While much of the banter between the characters is inventive, the plot turns are predictable - complete with a romantic misunderstanding straight out of The Karate Kid (and 20 other films)."
0,Fresh,The Florida Project is magic in the real.
0,Fresh,"The titular act of violence is the best scene in the film, radiating a kind of unavoidable fatality that elevates the lethal gunshot from a just another bang to something triggering a very strong sense of epochal change."
1,Rotten,"Snow Blind calls itself a documentary, but it never stops feeling like the in-house channel on a ski-lodge television."
0,Fresh,"A masterpiece that merges the Bard's bittersweet wisdom with the wit, style, and idealism of '30s Hollywood musicals."

0,Fresh,An awe-inspiring survey of global surf culture.

0,Fresh,"This much I can guarantee, as you keep trying to guess where the story is headed, you will not be disappointed when it gets there."
1,Rotten,"Whether or not people believe that these Virgin Mary visions really happened, Fatima does a disservice to the story by presenting the people involved as tedious and forgettable characters instead of fascinating people."
0,Fresh,"Works pretty effectively both for those who know the rest of the series and as an individual, enjoyable ghost train of an experience in its own right."

0,Fresh,"It's a wobbly but amusing film that only really raises eyebrows at the end, when it briefly behaves like a cry for global economic justice."
1,Rotten,"A deeply irritating horror-comedy that might have worked as a ""Funny or Die"" short but which is pretty much DOA as a feature-length concern."
1,Rotten,"It's a movie that could have packed an emotional punch and considered the cost of pursuing purity, but instead it settles for schmaltz."
1,Rotten,It's not a lack of originality that makes Shopgirl too Saks for its own good; it's the attempt to make a distinctive item into a blue-light special that betrays it.
1,Rotten,Slumdog.

0,Fresh,"Sucker Punch is superficial and erotic visual stimulation, much like the kind of experience some might have when they immerse themselves in a video game to do battle with the enemy."
0,Fresh,"Wolverine is big, dumb fun, a popcorn movie if ever there was one. And it's probably the only movie this summer to feature a superhero whose most dazzling talent seems to be shuffling a deck of cards."

1,Rotten,"In short, anything for laughs, which are far outnumbered by the dismayed, unbelieving groans issuing from viewers who have to sit through it."
0,Fresh,"There are flashes of visual invention scattered throughout and Helen Mirren steals the show with a stunning vocal display of austerity, but this is very much a case of Pixar going through the motions..."
1,Rotten,"The film is tiresome not merely because of the familiarity of the material, but because there's little verve surrounding the proceedings."
0,Fresh,What the film does have is some fantastically cheesy lines combined with some humorous social commentary.

0,Fresh,"The fictional family that has defined satire on the small screen since 1989 has finally found a 'Home, Sweet Home' on the big screen."
1,Rotten,"They could play John Williams' ominous ""Imperial March"" over scenes of Uncle Deadly from the Muppets lobbing Green Goblin pumpkin-bombs at Scrat the saber-squirrel (I mean, they literally could, legally...), and many of us would still feel emotions stir."
0,Fresh,"A pretty entertaining movie, in a kick-you- in-the-pants kind of way."
0,Fresh,"A gloriously understated, muted production."
1,Rotten,To call this immeasurably terrible movie 'stupid and nonsensical' would be an insult to stupid and nonsensical movies.
1,Rotten,Keeping the Faith's hipness is limited to a couple of one-liners. Its exploration of faith and love is skin deep.

0,Fresh,"""5 Flights Up"" is far from perfect, but it's also undeniably touching."
0,Fresh,"[It's] an original and intriguing film that offers a unique perspective on the idea of self, the movie presenting an odd mid-life crisis at twenty-something."
0,Fresh,"Rare is a character who has both a one-note comedy beat (executed beautifully) and an extreme amount of emotional depth. What makes Forky so compelling is not his existential crisis, but his deep empathy for others..."

0,Fresh,"All in all, serviceable, if unremarkable extras - befitting the film they come from."
0,Fresh,Drive is a triumph of minimalist cool.
0,Fresh,"It's fluffy and enjoyable, with an infectious Randy Newman song score and sumptuous animation to compensate for a bland story that goes on longer than it should."
1,Rotten,A lot of people put a great deal of effort into this movie to create great effects and exciting action but the whole thing is led by a man who directs by numbers.
1,Rotten,"Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is the good king of the title, and while the actor may look fetching in a crown and cloak, he doesn't have half of the gravitas of Sean Bean's Boromir in the first film."
1,Rotten,"Even at under two hours, Shanghai Noon feels lengthier than a double bill of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West."

1,Rotten,... the film never digs far enough below the surface of this male pinup ...
0,Fresh,"Interesting, though always difficult, viewing."
1,Rotten,[The Coen Brothers'] token irreverence might be misplaced with Spielberg who veers into a Capraesque sanctimony that stops just short of jingoism.
0,Fresh,"Mesmo sendo um pouco mais longo do que deveria, o filme conta uma historinha simples, mas agradvel - e se beneficia enormemente do carisma de Hugh Jackman como um dos personagens-ttulo."
1,Rotten,The cautionary tale warning us about the dangers of gambling might be worth a small wager for some punters.
0,Fresh,Necessarily dark and disturbing.
1,Rotten,There's no likeability anywhere in this film.
0,Fresh,Green Room is one of those rare horror movies that actually gets better rather than worse as it proceeds.

0,Fresh,"An atmospheric haunted-house fright tale involving paranormal activities, ecological themes, folklore tales and lots of scares."

0,Fresh,...simply one of the best pictures of the year.
1,Rotten,"The movie is a chore to watch, more fun to talk about than to endure."
0,Fresh,"It's good, in a sturdy, muted, unsurprising way."
1,Rotten,The problem with all this sneaking around is that it is rarely ever all that suspenseful.
0,Fresh,This Romanian movie defies categorization -- it's halfway between a black comedy and a Fred Wiseman documentary. And it haunts you like the ghost of any dead person you've ever ignored.
1,Rotten,"If only the script had more attention given to details, then The Identical wouldn't have ended up looking like a pale imitation of what could have been a better movie."
0,Fresh,The film has a powerful undercurrent suggesting the feverish workings of a troubled yet brilliant mind.
1,Rotten,"Ungerer is certainly an irrepressible force, but beyond his surreal erotica getting him blacklisted from picture books in the early '70s, his life isn't very dramatic, and Bernstein's film pads it with historical footage and precious animations."
0,Fresh,"A sweet, wispy little romantic comedy."
0,Fresh,"Deerskin is a mordantly funny commentary on the fragility of identity, livelihood, and masculinity."
0,Fresh,"The imagery in Mr. Dosunmu's film is consistently surprising and lush. Even the straight-ahead portraits of his characters, used as emotional caesuras, are rich in colors and textures. But he's a storyteller, too ..."

1,Rotten,A really awful story that feels ripped from The Bold and the Beautiful.
1,Rotten,"Stone does everything he can to do justice to the real-life people he's depicting, and yet nothing he does can cover up the film's single but overarching weakness: The personal story he uses to portray the larger event is limited in scope and impact."
0,Fresh,"Murphy's tour de force as the eternally optimistic Patrick surely deserves an Oscar nomination. Thanks to Jordan's bravura storytelling, Breakfast on Pluto is one of very few movies this year truly worth remembering."

1,Rotten,"""Red Sparrow"" mistakes a slow pace for a slow burn. For a film that aims to be tense and thrilling, to keep the audience on a wire, there's little suspense."
0,Fresh,"one of Elvis' most compelling works, despite a forced, artificial ending."
0,Fresh,"The picture holds the interest by its fine, sentimental story, rather than by brilliance in writing or action."
1,Rotten,"[Director] Sarin was aiming for an epic and arrived at episodic. That might have been okay if the episodes weren't so partitioned from each other, the flashbacks failing to illuminate the present action."
1,Rotten,"Fred Claus seems a clever installment, not a seasonal classic, a buffet whose many nibbles you sample, move on and quickly forget."
0,Fresh,"A refreshingly exhilarating, emotional and ultimately uplifting examination of youngsters forging an unbreakable bond in the face of a malignant force far beyond their control."
0,Fresh,The film's ambiance is so wonderfully rendered and Coppola's perspective is so distinct it makes it all the more unexpected how slight the end result feels.
1,Rotten,"Whatever you want W. to be, you'll almost certainly be disappointed."
0,Fresh,A highly flawed but entertaining drama.
1,Rotten,"It's a strange feeling to see the summer's most promising premise self-destruct into something bizarre and unsatisfying, but that is the Hancock experience."
1,Rotten,"""Beyond the Reach"" is a grueling, unsatisfying thriller that fails the logic test in spectacular ways."
1,Rotten,A nostalgia factory of popular music that is less a movie than it is a vehicle for baby boomer reminiscence.
1,Rotten,"Me, I'll stick to appreciating Worm Rodman in his true and natural element: the 96-foot hardwood floor."
0,Fresh,"While Zohan purveys the familiar Sandler mix of Jewvenile humor and geriatric love, it's less about a manic manchild than it is a raunchily wholesome message movie that deploys stereotypes in order to smash them."
0,Fresh,"Written by Weir and John Collee, this is a faithful adaptation of the O'Brian novels told with a well-paced, rousing exuberance and uncommon intelligence and humanity, richly detailed in both character and action."
0,Fresh,The characters were no longer constrained by rubber suits or the laws of physics.
0,Fresh,"A skittery, rambling but often absorbing portrait of the Chelsea Hotel."
1,Rotten,"On a hot summer day, a family trip to the movies can be a time-filler or a time-waster. Apprentice honorably fits the second category."
0,Fresh,Good clean family fun even as the ultimate Oedipal wish.
0,Fresh,"An utterly beguiling, magical film from start to finish."
1,Rotten,"Not every director is well-suited to Bondland. ""There's something horribly efficient about you,"" Kurylenko says to Craig at one point. The same goes for the film."
1,Rotten,"100 percent of the laughs come courtesy of Faris, who's particularly good in the early going, when her babe-in-the-woods act reaches Homer Simpson-like heights of comic obliviousness. As usual, the movie eventually lets her down."
0,Fresh,"Sitting in the middle of Silence is a powerful, intelligent, moving, series of thoughts about how religions might change and shift and adapt when they move from country to country, from people to people."
0,Fresh,...never lacks for a sense of excitement and enthusiasm.
0,Fresh,"Hanna and Juran make up for their lack of supernatural thrills by packing lots of talking, fighting, dancing and drinking -- as well as a few lame jokes -- into the movie's harmless 65 minutes."
1,Rotten,"Although Rickman pours on the lavish set and costume design and would-be-witty court repartee (it is not), the film he has fashioned is strangely inert and unexciting."
0,Fresh,"The coldest, most alienated Hollywood film from an era of suspicion and anxiety, a time in American life when we realized that ordinary discourse had to be decoded, that the unseen forces controlling our lives were sinister, and knowledge was fragmentary."
0,Fresh,"Director Mark Decena and co-writer, Tim Breitbach, have formulated that rare screenplay that adapts out of its characters and not a predetermined road. The camera doesn't just love Sabrina Lloyd - it's looking to get down on one leg and propose."
0,Fresh,"""Virtual reality without the headset"", [Nolan] calls it, and it's no idle boast. Everything has been meticulously -- and effectively -- designed to dissolve the barrier between you and the screen."
0,Fresh,"There's a real sense of period, even if the film does occasionally become over-sentimental."
1,Rotten,"Slavishly reverent, it is accidentally hilarious in its earnestness -- and in its sincere attempts at a touch of humor; it will please believers who don't want their faith tested in the least..."
0,Fresh,"In all honesty, there's not a lot of deep laughs. But Room for Rent is a funny, light comedy that stays a step ahead of the audience. It's solid story and with solid performances worth checking out."
0,Fresh,"Writer-director Leigh Whannell takes the basis of H.G. Wells' 1897 novel of ""The Invisible Man"" and gives it a Hitchcockian-like psychological horror-thriller spin made relevant for today's #MeToo era."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, there are hints that Cop Out was supposed to be something smarter and less lazy, but no-one involved seems to be able to counter the truly terrible script."
0,Fresh,Suburban malaise has seldom been better looking or better acted.
1,Rotten,"The film's primary pleasure is watching James communicate Duncan's growing confidence in the acceleration of his stride or the occasional unguarded smile. It's a likable acting turn, though one the film does not always serve honestly."
0,Fresh,A wonderful Korean film that is a tutorial on the miracles that can be wrought by unconditional love.
0,Fresh,"Watchable comedy with superb comic performances and a steady stream of decent gags, but it's also a good twenty minutes too long and is occasionally let down by some lazy plotting."
0,Fresh,"Directing duties go to Frank Marshall who makes a brilliant debut, effectively weaving together thrills and humour in equal measure."
0,Fresh,"Tempering its sweeping scope with wit, humor, and just a little dose of dramatics, Thor is a super-charged fantasy epic that can stand alone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
1,Rotten,"The whole movie feels extrapolated from the five-second clip of a scheming chipmunk on YouTube, bulked out with shots of Fraser being thwacked with some generic crunch noise and falling backwards with his feet in the air."
0,Fresh,"The moments when the movie puts the audience into the freakish environment of its characters are its most fun, and best experienced in a theater with loud speakers."
0,Fresh,"It's the most essential ""see it on the big screen or else"" experience since 'The Walk'."
0,Fresh,"""Run All Night"" proves once again that you shouldn't mess with Liam Neeson's kids."
1,Rotten,An overbearing lampoon of American war profiteering -- a comedy so leaden it could make a liberal hate liberal Hollywood.
0,Fresh,"It's like Zombieland, but without the laughs . . . or the zombies."
0,Fresh,"Zhou, in particular, gives a heartbreaking performance."
1,Rotten,"Bright is a film trying too hard, with an execution that leaves something to be desired."
1,Rotten,"For all its great potential, Reign of Fire turns out to be just another bughunt movie -- a disappointingly talky, haphazard one."
0,Fresh,Strong central performances make this harrowing chronicle a gripping tale.
0,Fresh,Portman gives a meticulously controlled performance that culminates in the most haunting and grandiose cinematic coup de grace of the year.
1,Rotten,All told - and this film knows exactly who its audience is - a reminder of what famously enriching company habitual stoners are.
0,Fresh,An energetic and often quite diverting Technicolor musical which pokes fun at the state of turmoil in Hollywood when silent pictures suddenly became unsaleable.
0,Fresh,"Most of the story, about a police investigation of a teenage suspect, unreels at a measured pace that will drive some viewers crazy. But the ending justifies the buildup."
1,Rotten,Julie & Julia seems satisfied to fall short of its potential - whether as an insightful romantic comedy or an exploration of food lust - relying on Streep to carry the film with her witty turn as Child.
0,Fresh,"... What it lacks in originality - it's basically ""Toy Story"" with animals - it makes up with laughs and charm."
0,Fresh,"What makes it great is the long relationship we've had with Sandler, the downs we've experienced as fans, and the pleasant surprise of an unexpected return to glory. Welcome back, Sandman."
1,Rotten,"Vastly disappointing, an uneasy mixture of characters and events, artifice and realism."
1,Rotten,"Too many threads are woven together here, but occasionally, it just connects."
0,Fresh,"Red Hill might be a bit of a mixed bag, but as a striking introduction to Patrick Hughes and a big screen Ryan Kwanten, it's certainly an exciting new frontier for Australian cinema."
0,Fresh,"There's more drama, backstabbing, temper tantrums and shocks in The Last Stand than in a season of ""Dynasty"". So far, it's the best event movie of the year."
0,Fresh,The wild and wonderful adventures of an oddball outsider with a terrible physical affliction who makes the most out of his journey in the company of a lovable band of eccentrics and misfits.
0,Fresh,Blessed is the go-for-it movie that can make room for dissonances and weirdness.
0,Fresh,"The movie taps into a vein of Dickensian sentiment, nightmare and idealism, ribaldry and tragedy that give it that part-dark, part-shining fairytale quality that imbues most King tales and all three of Darabont's features."
0,Fresh,"There's more to a Hollywood musical than the musical. There's fantasy. There's magic. There's a genre which isn't afraid to recreate what romance actually feels like. And that's where ""La La Land"" soars."

0,Fresh,"Mamet's film isn't sure what the hell to make of Spector. But, strangely, that's part of what makes it so compelling."
1,Rotten,The story overall is unimpressive and unconvincing.
1,Rotten,"A lot of it is klutzier than you may remember it being, and it leads to a wretched climax involving the fakest-looking octopus since Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster."
0,Fresh,The story is often wildly funny along the way...
1,Rotten,"Documentary about the three-day music festival preceding the famous Ali-Foreman fight has its moments, but plays too much like what it is: outtakes from the Oscar-winning When We Were Kings."
0,Fresh,Interesting film that's just a little too much like an expanded X Files episode
1,Rotten,"It's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer, squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain."
0,Fresh,"A small, dark, simple love story with big, burning, complex emotions. If this really is Phoenix's final performance, it's one hell of a way to go."
0,Fresh,The Lighthouse is a fascinating work... a risky and unconventional project. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"A simplistic, featherweight cornball."
1,Rotten,"So we've got a paper cut and a phone call, and a romance that never feels as big as the movie tries to make it seem."
0,Fresh,"Guardians of the Galaxy may have done it first, but Thor: Ragnarok does it best."
0,Fresh,The Sea Inside is one of the best films of the year with a bravura performance by Javier Bardem that is both tender and poignant.
1,Rotten,"The well-established Big Momma combination of cheap and cheesy chuckles, sex-obsessed banter, and slapstick so broad even the biggest of mommas could easily hide behind it."
1,Rotten,That's what drove me nuts about the new comedy Coffee & Kareem; there's genuinely funny stuff on the margins that kept getting pushed back by a tired central premise.
0,Fresh,"Shamelessly preachy, but so slickly made that it works despite itself."
0,Fresh,"The Sentinel winds up being a cool way to spend a couple of hours. For the average moviegoer of late, that's almost joyous news."

0,Fresh,Philosophy's never looked so cool.
1,Rotten,Spends too much time on dull shenanigans by military men and sound effects of the screech-knock-bang variety.
0,Fresh,Mesmerizing ...
0,Fresh,...nearly topples over from the weight of its social commentary.
0,Fresh,"It is a polished effort and a worthy film, if you let go of expectations of a biography, and a strong showcase for Joaquin Phoenix and Jonah Hill, who may get some attention come awards season."
1,Rotten,"This film is only superficially illuminating, briefly informative; the drama is only mildly engaging, the imprisonment distantly horrific. It insists upon keeping us at an arm's length for its not inconsiderable running time."
1,Rotten,"Three Amigos is likable, but it never really finds a distinctive style. Not quite parody and not quite serious, it's more like a lengthy costume party."
0,Fresh,"Reynolds is fantastic as the deeply confused protagonist, while Arterton and Kendrick do some very subtle work in the margins. Don't read anything more. Just see it."
1,Rotten,"It's definitely a cute, workable premise, but as mishandled by director Shawn Levy, the inspiration that was required to make Museum fly is seldom on exhibit in this interminably monotonous production."
0,Fresh,"The curious thing about The Visitor is that even as it goes more or less where you think it will, it still manages to surprise you along the way."
0,Fresh,"Lawrence, so good in Winter's Bone, comes as a revelation."
1,Rotten,"The movie's giddy brio can leave you punch-drunk, and oddly unsatisfied."

0,Fresh,[Playmobil: The Movie] is a fun but bumpy ride.
0,Fresh,"Deathtrap, like many intricate stage thrillers, reveals its artifice on the screen but remains crackling good fun."
1,Rotten,"Engages the plight of the Mujahideen with a humanizing, doc-like approach (fascinating to witness, all these years later, when the ally/enemy tables have turned so drastically)."
0,Fresh,An eerily credible imagining of a U.S. that could be just around the corner.
0,Fresh,"Even if you can't explain the Standard Model or define ""supersymmetry,"" you'll walk away with a conviction that you've vicariously participated in a historic event."
1,Rotten,"A couple of brakes-off set pieces to the side, the antics here are strained, graceless and tiresomely crude, the sorts of things audiences feel they're supposed to laugh at rather than well-developed situations that generate genuine amusement."
0,Fresh,"The Main Event is pretty much what you'd expect ‒ noisy, overlong, wall-to-wall CG effects and arcane superhero lore ... Yes, it's all fairly formulaic, but on a Wow! scale never before experienced."
1,Rotten,... a dark comedy that doesn't provide nearly enough laughs to make us embrace the nasty vibe
0,Fresh,"It's witty, clever and pushes the technical limits of computer animation but it's as much an imitator as it is an innovator."
0,Fresh,"Shot - a little obviously - in black and white, Ian McDonald's film is otherwise a winning documentary that develops into a story as intense and focused as his subjects."
0,Fresh,A sweet little heart-tugger ... served by a plot that dares to go in directions we would not have supposed.

1,Rotten,"Violent and on-the-edge of funny, ""Fargo Lite,"" right up to the end, where the wheels come off."
0,Fresh,"An entertaining film if not an amazing one. It's not Del Toro's worst hour, but it's also not his finest."
1,Rotten,The Art of Getting By is a coming-of-age story about a geeky misfit who won't do any school work. It's not as riveting as it sounds.
0,Fresh,"What begins as an apparently simple tale of sibling interaction reveals a complex web of pain, guilt, and uncertainty."
0,Fresh,"There's little that's unfamiliar about director Jonathan Sobol's switchbacking caper so he winningly cashes in on the strength of his cast, particularly Russell's world-weary con and a scene-stealing Stamp as the languidly insolent Brit."

0,Fresh,"You've seen found footage horror and Nazi zombies before, but Frankenstein's Army mashes them together in a way that breathes new life into tired genre conventions."
0,Fresh,BlacKkKlansman is urgent and vital. It stands next to Do the Right Thing as one of the best movies ever made about racial intolerance in the United States.
0,Fresh,"You need to know right up front that I'm a music junkie, a person who cannot stand to go very long without hearing music I love. Although I count hundreds of musicians among my favorites, The Beatles are in my top 10."

0,Fresh,A splendid evocation of its literary inspiration.
0,Fresh,"The flirty tension between the two feels quietly credible, the camera occasionally shuddering with desire."
0,Fresh,"[Murray] proves he's lost none of his caustic charm. In St Vincent he's vinegar, adding just enough acidity to a screenplay that without him would have been sickeningly sweet."
0,Fresh,"The film's effectiveness largely stems from the flat-out lameness of the opposition arguments, the lack of scientific credentials of those making them, and the self-interest of their corporate bosses."
0,Fresh,"First-time director Stu Zicherman deserves the most praise just for assembling this cast, and particularly for giving Scott such a big role. These are astonishingly talented people who do most of the heavy lifting."
1,Rotten,Sinbad is a movie that suffers from a glaring lack of inspiration.
1,Rotten,"Hot Summer Nights is more interested in style over substance, character tropes over character. Without that, the audience is just as lost as the characters on screen."
0,Fresh,An uncomfortable but significant success.
1,Rotten,Rehashing the cliches from several beaten-to-death movie categories doesn't add up to much.
1,Rotten,"Unless you're a fan of Keret's, you likely won't get much out of this odd, R-rated trifle."
0,Fresh,"The very idea is staggering, and your first reaction is wonder, sharing in the puppyish delight the brothers take in each other."
0,Fresh,"A clanging, thrashing threequel that represents a near-complete upgrade over 2009's critically-despised Revenge of the Fallen."
0,Fresh,"In a medium where the important decisions are almost always dictated by commerce rather than art, Brokeback Mountain is as close to perfection as we are likely to get."
0,Fresh,"Much like Rutger Hauer's turn as a replicant in Scott's Blade Runner, Fassbender's performance may launch Prometheus into the cult stratosphere."
1,Rotten,An utterly inane whodunit more in search of a cheap joke than the perpetrators of any crime.
0,Fresh,Gains artful integrity from Zhao's favored docu-fiction technique - roughly tracing a script around the experiences of her non-professional actors - and dusty-dreamy visual style.
1,Rotten,Surely this is it for Sylvester Stallone.
1,Rotten,"[I]t's a tedious, preposterous story about how men use, misuse, and misunderstand female sexuality."
0,Fresh,It's the rare action picture whose adrenaline-driven thrills neither overshadow the characters nor degenerate into cartoonish preposterousness.
0,Fresh,Feels like such a throwback to the '80s that it's hard to believe it wasn't brought forth in a time machine created by Doc Brown.
1,Rotten,"Sean Bean is too intelligent an actor for the part. He lets slip little flickers of pain and remorse that strongly suggest he has reasons for his behavior. When they're never revealed, we feel like the picture is wasting our time."
0,Fresh,"No movie in memory feels as necessary as Selma, while the history it portrays is echoed by current events. When the value of black lives is asserted in the streets by marchers of all colors, spurred by wrongs to be righted, indignities to overcome."
1,Rotten,"Even if stars Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson are mom's all-time favorites, don't subject her to this cloying, plotless dose of saccharine unless she's done you wrong."
0,Fresh,This is a fine film that is as much about the struggles with and consequences of faith as it is the recounting of a religious tale.
0,Fresh,"After watching this film for the zillionth time, there's no doubt in my mind that this 'little doggy' belongs at the top echelon of any list having to do with great crime pictures."
0,Fresh,"Despite some elemental flaws in logic and plausibility, this is a tense and potent film at times that hints at the sort of greatness that we can find to a greater degree in Ms. Arnold's other works, Wasp and Fish Tank."
1,Rotten,"The jokey elements are artificial, and strike a note of banality that undermines whatever sense of transcendence the film might be attempting in its stark, sweeping cinematography and mystical, dreamy milieu."
0,Fresh,"It turns out to be every bit as crass, offensive and incorrect as you'd expect, but it's also - gulp! - really very funny an awful lot of the time, as well as bizarrely gripping."
0,Fresh,"Like the wild things inhabiting Max's world, it's fascinating but also lumbering -- and (to paraphrase The Troggs) it's unlikely to make everyone's heart sing."
0,Fresh,"It's themes of spirituality, religion and love eternal in an increasingly secular and jaded world is wonderfully presented and touching in its tangibility, although it often ventures into brazen territory."

1,Rotten,Imagines Heaven and Hell as places so deeply mired in the business- as-usual hassles of earthly life that the battle between good and evil becomes a downright dull affair.
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, this is the Cliff Notes version of a religious epic, a greatest-hits package that skips all the hard parts. Incidents are shown but not examined, and anything that requires more than a superficial explanation is simply ignored."
1,Rotten,"Individual set pieces work nicely, but the story bogs down and certain subplots are dropped almost entirely. ... NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM had the potential to be so much more and in the hand of a real visionary, it could have been something. As it is, it's a p"

0,Fresh,'Robert the Bruce' is an enjoyable sort-of-but-not-exactly spinoff of 'Braveheart.'
1,Rotten,"After The Tailor of Panama made it clear that Brosnan can slide into character-based comedy with ease, Evelyn proves that his more challenging, dramatic work is in desperate need of being vigorously shaken and stirred."
0,Fresh,"Craig is a marvel, but the decision to have Bond engaged in a game of Hold 'Em poker is a betrayal of the character and an embarrassing bit of pandering. Small detail, I know."
1,Rotten,There's a certain disarming sweetness to the film. The scenes are lit in amber warmth and Joyce's Dublin fable of lost hopes and living memories is treated with respect. But the acting pool is only adequate.
1,Rotten,"The episodic plot encompasses a series of familiar gags about casual sex and finding your soul mate, few of them delivered with much enthusiasm."
0,Fresh,"Fascinating still, but suffers from lack of more sophisticated special effects. Still...imagine Raquel Welch moving around inside."

0,Fresh,"Super's arriving in UK cinemas only now, to avoid any direct comparisons with Matthew Vaughn's brilliant Kick-Ass. So naturally that's why there's a massive ""MUCH BETTER THAN KICK-ASS"" quote on the poster."
1,Rotten,A rather stagy and creaky early talkie (1931) by Alfred Hitchcock.
0,Fresh,"It's a female led comedy with heartbreak, self-worth and self-realization at its core. The film is both raunchy and emotional, and is backed by an outstanding cast."
0,Fresh,"Fun, action packed movie that starts off as a complex mystery, but devolves into an implausible chase movie. Then, you realize it doesn't matter because you are enjoying yourself."
0,Fresh,It ... shows how much can be done with a business-as-usual CIA-thriller script when it's bolstered by effective acting and expert direction.
0,Fresh,I don't know that I've ever seen a film that works so well on both the emotional and intellectual levels.
0,Fresh,"Old-fashioned but enjoyable and touching, the Swiss Vitus contributes to a growing body of films about dilemmas faced by a child prodigy and his parents, much in the vein of Seraching for Bobby Fischer; as the boy's grandfather, Bruno Ganz is terrific"
0,Fresh,"The film gives Pace a blank canvas on which to deploy more screen presence than everyone else combined, often just by directing a deep gaze in the general direction of the camera."
0,Fresh,"Taissa Farmiga gives a spectacular, spine-tingling performance in Anna, and that should be more than enough for viewers to look past this thriller's weaknesses."

0,Fresh,"This is a very different film to Audiard's most recent release - the impressive A Prophet - but it has a similar sense of maturity about it, and could well have acting awards aplenty heading its way in the coming months."
0,Fresh,"Bring your rom-com Bingo cards out as few cliches go ignored, but the film is enjoyable enough even if it's far from perfection."
0,Fresh,"There is nothing new under the sun, but at least the talented Boyle still brings the heat."
0,Fresh,Imagine if Sam Peckinpah had directed an Amblin movie with a screenplay by Jim Thompson. That's COP CAR in a nutshell.

1,Rotten,"Moronic, but even moronic humour can be passingly entertaining, in parts."
0,Fresh,"By rights The Kid should be dreadful. Surprisingly enough, it often soars to heights of not bad."
1,Rotten,"Why is such a talented cast doing such weak material? This finally becomes clear an hour in, when most of the actors get to do what they love: play emotional breakdowns."
0,Fresh,Kubrick's spellbinding 1980 horror epic is one of the true masterpieces to come out of the genre. And Nicholson's descent into unbridled insanity is simply unforgettable.
0,Fresh,"A heady spirit of spontaneity permeates the proceedings, suggesting the entire pic, much like the concert it documents, was conceived, planned and completed in a single burst of creative enthusiasm."
1,Rotten,I can't help but think that Killing Ground leans on the concept of spiritual comeuppance for Indigenous genocide as a potent but lazy background theme with which to bolster an otherwise rote narrative and set of filmmaking choices.
0,Fresh,"With its spectacular, brutal battle sequences, it has the sword-and-sandals historical scope of 'Gladiator' - but not the heart."
0,Fresh,"Information enters the screen from too many directions ...This is distracting at first, but the movie smooths out and finds its rhythm, and the closing passages are quite moving."

1,Rotten,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy begins to seem phlegmatic after a while."
1,Rotten,"It's stuck in a big-budget-movie middle ground - not quite thrilling enough to be an action movie, not quite funny enough for a comedy - and, once you've pondered the impressive size of the beanstalk, there's not much else there."

0,Fresh,"Much of Elizabeth Meriweather's dialogue is snappy, and ""No Strings Attached"" - though overlong - is mostly painless."
1,Rotten,"Though Iraq War is in the background, Lucky Ones is yet another disappointing 9/11 film; it's a known fact that for a road picture to work, you need interesting encounters, revelations, self-discoveries, humor and color, all of which are in short supply"
0,Fresh,"Luhrmann is quite content to stay on the surface, to rub elbows with tuxedoed gents and bewitching flappers."

0,Fresh,Tomb Raider doesn't have the most compelling story but we so rarely get to see female characters in roles this physical it keeps the movie interesting enough to watch.
1,Rotten,"This is Eastwood's weakest work in years, perhaps because it yokes itself to a hot-button theme instead of a story that resonates."

1,Rotten,"For fans of Danny Boyle, Trance is a dreamy disappointment but you can't help thinking that during the making of this film his mind was transfixed somewhere else in East London."
1,Rotten,"Kevin Kline is by far the best thing in this movie, which is otherwise so overloaded with oddball characters that it never finds an even keel."

0,Fresh,"Overall, ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" feels like a movie that didn't need making, but at least it justifies it existence."
0,Fresh,A breath of champagne on a warm summer night.
1,Rotten,"Yet another dull, overdone and predictable horror movie."
1,Rotten,"I don't mind a film with a surprise ending but, rather than enhancing the film, the climactic revelation in Fight Club cancels out everything previously seen. In fact, the bitter end of the film is a hypocritical cop-out."

1,Rotten,"Even if you erase the messy gender politics, you're still left with a mildly watchable actioner defined by unremarkable set pieces, a generic script, and flat characters."
0,Fresh,It's clear that both Rocky and Hoover have been greatly changed by their experiences; what's more surprising is how effective Blood Brother is at moving the audience as well.

1,Rotten,An incomprehensible furball of grungy kids running around screaming.
0,Fresh,It just never takes off.
1,Rotten,"The combination of director George Stevens and source novelist Edna Ferber, both given to expressions of overblown high seriousness, yields a long, slow, achingly self-important movie."
1,Rotten,That they should learn Greek dancing from a Mexican-born actor in a film produced by 20th Century Fox is somehow less ironic than just about right for a movie like this.
1,Rotten,What begins as an intelligent horror film ends up a trivial and uninspired schlock movie.
1,Rotten,Emotions in this film operate on a made-for-TV level; they don't engage you.
0,Fresh,"The violence is gory, gratuitous and convincingly staged, a credit to effects duo Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero, whose carnage looks impressively (or nauseatingly) real, even if the boobs are not."

0,Fresh,"Harry Brown thrashes, telegraphing its punches from a mile away and whiffing every other knockout attempt, but when it connects, it's a whopper."
1,Rotten,"Like a Boss could be a good uplifting film, a narrative about independence and beauty in the face of misunderstanding. Instead, it buckles and falls into the uglier portions of what's inside."

0,Fresh,"While entertaining enough, McQueen feels more like an attempt to protect the estate than to understand the man."
0,Fresh,"Fantasia, with dead chickens."
1,Rotten,"An instant cult movie, and while it certainly succeeds on that level and members of the cult will embrace it for that very reason, the uninitiated--though impressed by its style--will probably be more exhausted than delighted."
1,Rotten,"Granted, not even Morgan Freeman could make the African Cats narration endurable, but Jackson really suffers his way through it, alternating between cloyingly overplaying things and rattling off sentences in a bored monotone."
0,Fresh,"Hosseini and Alidoosti find the truth of every scene, and their performances keep The Salesman vital even as you sense the director pulling its strings."
1,Rotten,"Other than an unflinching, intense and extraordinary performance from Al Pacino as the Cuban-born gangster Tony Montana, this gruesome offering has little to recommend."
1,Rotten,"The camera bounces along, its path blocked frequently by the back of some fleeing figure, so that you're never quite sure where you are, where you're going or what you're looking at..."
0,Fresh,Just an old-fashioned love song.
1,Rotten,Grade-C SoCal exploitation.
0,Fresh,"[The film] isn't without clich or convenience, but it possesses enough heart to combat them."
0,Fresh,Her sincerity and compassion are her greatest super powers of all.
0,Fresh,"Payne's characters might have become caricatures, but he has too much affection for them--and too much respect for his audience--to allow them to be anything less than real."
1,Rotten,The futuristic thriller is overly familiar and never especially gripping -- and too somber and cerebral for the young action crowd -- but it looks terrific and is in no way an embarrassment.
0,Fresh,"It is a romantic comedy in the best classic Hollywood style, albeit one with some sharp writing and genuinely human as well as funny moments."
1,Rotten,Takes some of Hollywood's grandest silk purses and makes a bunch of sow's ears.
0,Fresh,"The Last Jedi suffers from occasional inconsistencies in character and plot, but these quibbles are easily absorbed into the impressively vast and colorful canvas that Johnson paints with such passion and empathy."
1,Rotten,"Yeah, the puppets look neat; too bad the story's stupid and the voice-acting sucks."
1,Rotten,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters is now the worst American Godzilla movie. Say what you will about Roland Emmerich's, but at least he showed Godzilla a lot."
1,Rotten,"These characters, archetypes all, never come to life, never engage us, never make us feel."
1,Rotten,Still Alice is so busy being compassionate that it forgets to be anything else.
0,Fresh,"Alarming, both for the way it allows its antihero to fully fall into madness and for the violence that this fall involves."
0,Fresh,There's so much going on behind Murray's sad eyes that words aren't necassary. A great performance.
1,Rotten,"Stiles looks mildly annoyed by the whole exercise, as if she thought this feather-light material was beneath her ample acting talents."
1,Rotten,"It's all meant to be a sexy, tony thriller, but the script embroils Moore and Seyfried in such mortifying tawdriness that it exposes Chloe for what it is: soft-core porn without the courage of its convictions."
0,Fresh,The very Tom Cruise-like Sean Faris makes this respectable portrayal noteworthy considering the gritty sport's irrelevancy to most Americans.
1,Rotten,"[Far from] the rebellious spirit of Carrie, Repo Man and Some Kind of Wonderful, the only teen outsiders Hollywood now deals with are the over-privileged."
1,Rotten,"There are scenes during which Everett's Wilde commands our wide-eyed attention, still mesmerizing despite his physical and psychological decline. Yet in between those quickened moments, The Happy Prince trudges forward with monotonous uniformity."
1,Rotten,"Robert Tannen's first-produced screenplay certainly doesn't lack for story -- or clichs, for that matter. Nor does Tannen skimp on trite, predictable plot twists, or well-worn, stock characters in his pedestrian script."
0,Fresh,Ugly drama about the troubles during the dark Middle Ages.
1,Rotten,"It's somewhat interesting to witness the events that led to one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century, but not 2 hours, 5-minutes worth of interesting."
0,Fresh,"In his striking American debut, Bayona (Orphanage) achieves the almost impossible task of balancing a disaster movie of epic proportions with intimate family drama, anchored by Oscar-caliber turns from Watts and McGregor."
1,Rotten,"[Robert] De Niro is fine in the role, but every time he opens his mouth on stage to make a joke, he's just not funny."
0,Fresh,"The skillful Patrick Marber adapted this gripping drama from a novel by Zoe Heller, and it's both literate and urgently plotted, with a voice-over from Dench that cuts like broken glass."
1,Rotten,"A dull, unfocused and poorly directed documentary that lacks insight and fails to coherently and engagingly illuminate the subject of black metal."
1,Rotten,"""Lucy in the Sky"" says it's inspired by a true story, and while it draws some of its details from what really happened, there is very little inspiration evident on screen."
1,Rotten,The silence became deafening at the end of a promotional screening when one person slowly clapped three times. It sounded exactly like the one-man applause gag that signed off '60s-era 'Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In' each week -- only without the laughs.
1,Rotten,In college they warn you against the kind of history where things had to happen because they happened the way they happened. Thus we miss the question of what kind of plotting Mary had been up to -- real or imaginary.
1,Rotten,A thoroughly repulsive picture that's even worse when it tries to add some dark humor to the grisly mix of carnage and gore.
1,Rotten,"Seed of Chucky is so self-referential that despite some inspired madness, it's less a movie than a celebration of its own snarkiness."
0,Fresh,"Tautly written and performed with intensity, Queen of Earth isn't afraid of portraying unlikable characters, exposing their flaws and insecurities to the viewing audience."
0,Fresh,"Braveheart is beautifully shot, well-acted, and offers an interesting, but an untruthful, story about what many believe to be a great Scotsman."
1,Rotten,Goes down in a ball of flames
0,Fresh,"As impressively mounted as Braveheart and Gladiator, but as directed by Hong Kong action master John Woo, it easily surpasses them in terms of style and grace, action and cinematography"
0,Fresh,"Look out for perky Brit Ophelia Lovibond, who provides a perfectly pleasing performance as Popper's alliteration-prone assistant, Pippi, who peppers her pronouncements with a profusion of p's."
1,Rotten,It's just one self-indulgence after (or before) another.

1,Rotten,The very first scene in the new Madonna movie The Next Best Thing stumbles and the movie never recovers.
0,Fresh,What makes Creed work as well as it does is the same thing that made the first Rocky the sleeper hit it was in 1976; writer Aaron Covington and writer/director Ryan Coogler give as much attention to what goes on outside the ring as within it.
0,Fresh,"You know how horror sequels tend to be a load of old guff? Not this one. In fact, 2's about as good as they get."
0,Fresh,A quirky drama written and directed by Robert Duvall in which he plays a hit man enchanted with the dance form that most exquisitely gives expression to his soul.
0,Fresh,The film is a declaration in favor of clean humor and adventures without larger concerns. [Full Review in Spanish]

0,Fresh,Yanagimachi's inventive film about a collegiate film school project contains tangled webs of melodramatic fun along with moments of self-reflection
0,Fresh,"It's a powerful, moving story, but that doesn't mean it moves quickly. [It's a] very serious and often grim film."
0,Fresh,"A funny tongue-in-cheek comedy, cinematic commentary and murder mystery all rolled in to one."
0,Fresh,"The fact that this romance unfolds on screen in the form of an explosive musical, capturing JJ's transmutation into Jordan, the edgy artist, makes the film an absolutely engaging affair."
0,Fresh,"Being 17 boldly examines the fear of letting go and giving in - the terror, in short, of becoming an adult."
0,Fresh,"More slapstick than gumshoe, The Nice Guys is at its best when riffing broadly on the chaotic chemistry between its chalk-and-cheese male stars."
0,Fresh,"Prometheus elicits Alien memories for viewers who have them, but works on its own, too, as a model of a contemporary (and, as is the contempo mode, long-winded) sci-fi horror pic."
0,Fresh,The script is really well done and if I was a teenager I would love this movie to pieces.
0,Fresh,"Making sure those differences between its countless characters are both heavily discernible, and endlessly interesting, is what allows the individuals of Slacker to come alive as people."
0,Fresh,The Boxtrolls has a few fun moments that children might enjoy and a great vocal cast that adults will appreciate including Nick Frost and Richard Ayoade as henchmen Mr Trout and Mr Pickles.
0,Fresh,"As we often do with these kinds of movies, we mostly sit there thinking, ""Nobody talks like this."""
0,Fresh,"[Davis'] homage -- tender, never hagiographic -- also contains some biting analysis of the racism, both overt and insidious, that the artist was up against."
1,Rotten,"Pollack makes a solid job of it, as does Cruise. But solid isn't enough when it comes to thrillers -- or courtroom dramas, for that matter. Solid is great when it comes to office furniture."
0,Fresh,"A Fantastic Woman rests on the shoulders of Daniela Vega's performance as Marina. Vega smoulders, seethes, and occasionally implodes. It's a piece of work of astonishing, internalised power."
1,Rotten,The cast excels at transcending its material. The script by Justin Haythe matches Francis Lawrence's direction; it's workmanlike and steady and pretty flat.
0,Fresh,"The Wind Rises becomes a near-Edenic look at the world, full of casual heroism, and a long, long string of romantic and emotional triumphs."
0,Fresh,Everly could be a spinoff in the world of Kill Bill. It feels lovingly irreverent towards assassin tropes.
0,Fresh,Editor David Teague skilfully places original animated inserts and favourite movie scenes to allow us a brief glimpse into Owen's wonderful Disneyfied psyche.
0,Fresh,A slew of terrific performances help to elevate Wilder's twist-ridden courtroom drama above your standard fare in the genre.
0,Fresh,"Nurse Betty's two hallmarks are originality and star quality, both of which combine to draw the viewer through the film's occasional rough spots."
0,Fresh,"Intended or not, it felt like an incredible metaphor for a world built on images that don't represent the reality behind them."

0,Fresh,"Apesar de levemente inferior ao longa chinês, este é um filme vigoroso que demonstra a habilidade de seu diretor em conduzir tramas violentas e complexas."
0,Fresh,"What will rouse empathy and exasperation, though, is one teacher's attempt to act more like a colleague or mentor than an intimidating white male authority figure%u2014a teacher a student can call un ami."
1,Rotten,The film just translates the basic idea for a new generation under the ill-conceived notion that it was necessary.
0,Fresh,"An intelligent, slow-burn political thriller boasting stellar performances from its talented ensemble cast that compensate for the screenplay's minor shortcomings."

0,Fresh,Mainstream American animation hasn't produced anything this memorable since Aladdin.
1,Rotten,"The trash heap of ""There's Something About Mary"" ripoffs grows a little higher."
1,Rotten,If Pasolini had something more than grubby fantasy on his mind -- and presumably he did -- it isn't immediately apparent.
1,Rotten,"Given a more credible narrative that cared a little about the characters, Shanghai Knights could have been solid entertainment. As it is, it ranks no higher than a passable diversion."
1,Rotten,An experiment in tedium that's filled with more of the sickeningly gory nonsense we've come to expect from the Friday the 13th series.
1,Rotten,Too dark for kids but too juvenile for adults.
0,Fresh,"...expertly built around a story that just can't match the superior technical details. For most, none of that will matter. It is a cut above most of what is new and available on VOD and will make passable, if unnerving, date night viewing."
0,Fresh,"A blunt reminder that everything in this story concerning a craven, paranoid president's loathing of an aggressive free press did not exactly vanish with the Nixon administration."
1,Rotten,"Apparently, characters are supposed to be so racist, controlling, and narrow-minded, it's funny."
0,Fresh,Visually delightful film that makes that practically nothing feels a repetition with respect to the Harry Potter saga. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Reminiscient of Keith Gordon's fantastic A Midnight Clear mixed with a healthy dose of Rod Serlingism, Straight Into Darkness is a dark and stark little tale."
0,Fresh,"Emotional nuance, outstanding voice performances (particularly from Bennet) and artful animation all combine to lift the film."
0,Fresh,The Armstrong Lie is eye-opening and myth-shattering and more than a little depressing.
0,Fresh,"The special effects are dizzying and truthfully, director Baltasar Kormakur seems to have dedicated most of his effort to giving the audience the feeling of being right there with the climbers."
0,Fresh,A peaceful and gently stirring documentary that considers faith and architecture and human achievement in something like geologic time.
0,Fresh,O filme mais corajoso da carreira de Steven Spielberg.
1,Rotten,"Tolkien isn't necessarily a bad movie, it's just a messy one. Parts of it feel relevant and emotional, while others feel distant and disjointed."
0,Fresh,"Kore-eda's sense of style remains enticing, but he might just as well have made a pulpy John Grisham-type yarn."
1,Rotten,A frantic sequel that is tamer than the original but no more appealing.
0,Fresh,"Jackie is a hard movie to love, but its brittleness might be its most admirable quality."
1,Rotten,Either very brave or very stupid for Jennifer Tilly; I was glad to have it end.
0,Fresh,"Stands on its own, apart from its predecessors as a faithful and pretty fantastic ""Transformers"" installment."
1,Rotten,"For a film with such a sense of social consciousness, Traffik comes off as a by-the-numbers action thriller that throws in a misguided ""the more you know"" message after the fact."
0,Fresh,"The film betrays a deep empathy for the titular character, Goold treating Judy to a warmth so often denied her in her personal and professional life."
0,Fresh,"This docu avoids so many pitfalls that you have to admire the subjects' courage and directors' approach: It's emotional without being sentimental (as most kids pics are), factual but not manipulative, and it earns its inspiration sans being earnest."
0,Fresh,"Branagh's performance is a minor miracle, building a poignant portrait of a man whose painful and belated acquisition of self-knowledge finally saves him and enriches everybody around him. If Shakespeare wasn't like this, he should have been."
0,Fresh,The stakes were a good deal more than just winning or losing on the ice
0,Fresh,"So much of the film's comedy and sweetness stems from Eddie acknowledging that its time to grow up and take personal responsibility. You know, the stuff that's usually jammed into a third act montage in most comedies."
0,Fresh,"THE BOOK OF LIFE is funny, familiar, and fanciful, and it is one of the best animated features of the year."
1,Rotten,"So while I admire the effort and appreciate the drive, that's as far as I can go with praise."
1,Rotten,It looks great but the stagey dialogue grates and the plot leaves a bitter aftertaste.
0,Fresh,"Teeth-clenching, white-knuckle thriller!"
0,Fresh,"Worth the price of admission for the wildly creative (and brutally bloody) taxicab scene alone. Merciless, uncompromising, and unforgettable."
1,Rotten,"Conjuring magic, it goes abracadabra and snaps its fingers, but nothing happens."
0,Fresh,Ventures to the bleak side relentlessly and without apology.
0,Fresh,Such technical brilliance from Aardman Animations should be no surprise by this stage. What really hits you is the persistent level of charm and hilarity as it coasts along.
0,Fresh,"Wilde provides the quips, Helen Hunt the acting chops, Scarlett Johansson the ample bosom, and all of it is filtered through golden mediterranean light."
0,Fresh,"There's something so compassionate and warm about Jacob Hamilton's Jump Shot, a film that is on one level about the history of basketball but is really more about legacy and impact."
0,Fresh,Bully is a powerful megaphone amplifying the call to stop bullying in schools.
1,Rotten,"Petersen's Poseidon is a ridiculous collection of disaster clichés, eye-rollingly obvious symbolism, and two-dimensional stereotypes."
0,Fresh,"Rudely funny and gleefully violent, the film is a wound-up genre exercise that doesn't dip even a toe into reality but is a good time if you can get past that."
1,Rotten,"We get a vague movie that a few successful but chronically dissatisfied men will be able to call their own. The rest of us will see the film for what it is: a long, cold mumble from the heart."
1,Rotten,"Curiosity triggers our interest at first, but eventually, the tedious nature of the drawn-out exposition is akin to watching grass grow"
0,Fresh,"While it won't be everyone's cup of tea, especially paced as it is, Ad Astra is a true work of science fiction art."
0,Fresh,"An adequate updating of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" tale for a sliver of young film fans"
0,Fresh,"Unlike last years rather uninspiring What Happens in Vegas, the hysterical The Hangover actually ends up doing Sin City proud."
0,Fresh,"Filled with an empowering message and sharp-elbowed clapbacks at the toxic male naysayers of the Marvel fanboy universe, Captain Marvel is just what the MCU and fandom in general needs right now."
0,Fresh,Bay manages to tap into the child in all of us despite the film's awkward form and ridiculous script.
1,Rotten,From The Terrace builds up to one big cliche.
0,Fresh,"Performances are strong, the chemistry is palpable and romantic sorts will get something from the Stockholm syndrome story."

0,Fresh,Otto Preminger's formally dazzling 1958 film is an edifice constructed of contrasts.

0,Fresh,It's a visual joy to see Ozon's beautifully composed shots.
0,Fresh,"If you ignore the plot and just approach the flick as nothing more than a 21st century update of a Busby Berkeley-style musical, you will not be disappointed."

0,Fresh,The kind of movie that sinks under your skin.
0,Fresh,This is the fall film to see -- but just once.
1,Rotten,"Like a sputtering career, Ellie Parker pretty much goes nowhere, and it's difficult to imagine that it would be of interest to many beyond the Hollywood community."
1,Rotten,"First-time director, Janusz Kaminski, a well-known cinematographer, was very focused on the images of the film, perhaps at the cost of such things as story and character development."
0,Fresh,"Arrival is a smart film, but it's not a cold or clinical one."
0,Fresh,"While most may be familiar with the broadstrokes of this event, the script is still rivetting storytelling."
1,Rotten,The movie's too mellow cool for its own good.
0,Fresh,"What's truly remarkable is how, after half a century and an uncountable number of zombie films, novels, comics, TV shows, and video games, you can watch the original Night of the Living Dead and it still feels fresh and terrifying."
0,Fresh,The material is inherently compelling and anchored by Washington's performance.
0,Fresh,"The film ultimately works because of the inherent dramatics of the script, the magnificent cinematography/editing and the performances of Walken, DeNiro and Streep."
0,Fresh,A deft and hilarious blend of fiction and reality.
1,Rotten,What does it all mean? We are never quite sure. All we learn from this relentless saga of mental and physical solitude are the many varieties of suffering one can endure when one feels alone in the universe.
1,Rotten,The action veers between horrible sentimentality and worryingly tasteless violence.
0,Fresh,"Rick Sr. is a study in contradictions. McConaughey approaches the task with nuance and empathy, and the result amazes."
0,Fresh,A pretty good disaster movie despite some silliness and lapses in logic.
0,Fresh,"A sad, lyrical reflection on the foolish worship of movie stars."
0,Fresh,The latest film from pugnacious director/writer Paul Schrader is as austere and revelatory as a church confessional...It's a bleak portrait of a man in the midst of a spiritual breakdown that is only slightly undone by its rather unsatisfying conclusion.
0,Fresh,...a briskly-paced and mostly engaging romance that benefits rather substantially from the affable work of its stars...
0,Fresh,It could almost be accused of 'middle-class whining' -- something Linney's character frets about -- if not for its sharply observant conversations and strikingly personal performances.
0,Fresh,"This pic could make for a good date night, but renting the original would make for a better one."
0,Fresh,True story about underdog teens is predictable but sweet.
1,Rotten,"Despite an enjoyable turn from Brittany Murphy, the clichd plot (local poor boy pitches his way to the Major League) ensures that's the best this forgettable teen fodder can hope for."
0,Fresh,"A deliriously wild and totally charming ride from start to finish, as Cowboy, Indian and Horse charge all over the world in a whimsical assault of fun."
1,Rotten,"Great acting, stylish cinematography, nifty scares; too bad the story makes absolutely no sense, leaving an unprecedented amount of ""but wait, how did.."" questions unanswered."
1,Rotten,"""Don't See It"" is the kindest phrase I can use to describe this film."
0,Fresh,"After the initial establishment of character and atmosphere, the laughs come thick and fast, most notably from the marvellous [Roberto] Benigni."
1,Rotten,"Proving a third visit isn't always a good thing, ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" is a film that feels like it is stuck in idle."
1,Rotten,An almost astonishingly terrible horror anthology...
0,Fresh,The film represents an agreeably old-fashioned alternative to all the modernized reinventions of Arthur Conan Doyle's venerable detective in recent years.
0,Fresh,"Genuinely understands and tenderly expresses how messy, complicated, troubled and compassionate familial relationships can be."
1,Rotten,"Saitzyk's sappy pontifications on loss, redemption, and zealotry don't register as headily as they're meant to, and the spirituality invoked feels about as sincere as the Christian who only attends Christmas mass."
1,Rotten,"This film is one hell of a weird, hot mess."
1,Rotten,Let's fast-forward to the end of this review: This movie sucks!
1,Rotten,"This writer would like to thank the young gentleman who vigorously kicked the back of her chair during the family preview screening, thereby keeping her awake."
0,Fresh,"Alex of Venice succeeds because Messina, to use the locally appropriate parlance, doesn't ""get worked"" by weightier issues."
1,Rotten,"'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past' lacks energy and originality, + the characters are too shallow to care about. But Michael Douglas is delightful."
1,Rotten,These daffy sea creatures pale enormously next to the infinitely superior joys of The Incredibles and The Polar Express.
1,Rotten,...despite every intention the movie can't quite shake its American male point of view.
0,Fresh,I expect many of the film's worst reviews to come from critics disappointed that Robin Hood isn't the laughingly-bad disaster so many were expecting.
0,Fresh,A cunning and immensely likeable coming-of- parenting-age saga that repeatedly flies in the face of its own sitcom impulses.
0,Fresh,Julianne Moore is wonderfully good as Alice and her performance will bring a tear to many eyes.
1,Rotten,"There is scarcely a minute's worth of believable human behavior on display in G, which builds to a climax as incoherent as it is ludicrous."
0,Fresh,A solid bundle of modest charm.
1,Rotten,"Mr. Fessenden's ambition is admirable, and there's more than a little raw skill on display. If this, his first feature, isn't always worth recommending, his talents are certainly worth encouraging."
1,Rotten,"Rush Hour 3 is an exercise in critic-proofing: If you like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like."
0,Fresh,"While sympathetic to their plight, the directors prove alert to the story's wider impact, speaking to proud parents and outraged opponents alike."
0,Fresh,More banter and character interest would have livened things up but it's a solid action thriller that shows the stars are still prepared to sweat it even if the pay cheques boast a few less zeroes.
0,Fresh,"It's exceptionally tight work from director Robert Wise and screenwriter John Gay, who pays attention to fiery dramatics."
0,Fresh,"In spite of being presented in an unhurried, episodic manner, you will not find this over two-hour long docu-style indie film sluggish, for it showcases the minutiae of everyday life beautifully."
0,Fresh,"Steve Jobs, a study of the late co-founder of Apple that takes place in the hours and minutes prior to three separate product launches, is a powerful film with little subtlety."
0,Fresh,"The suspense and supernatural elements-especially as filmed in film-noir, 35-millimeter black-and-white-are as palpable as they are astonishing. A brilliant achievement."
1,Rotten,...a film that's an early favorite for worst comedy of the year.
1,Rotten,"Fails to ensnare its audience thanks to fatiguingly frequent ""ah, bet you didn't see that coming"" narrative twists."
1,Rotten,"Even for the realm of YA sci-fi, the boy-befriends-a-gun storyline of Kin is pretty messed up."
1,Rotten,The definition of 'rock' here seems to be winsome be-yourself ballads with a smattering of guitar.
1,Rotten,"Though timely and well-intentioned, this immigrants saga is too contrived and schematic to generate credibility or feeling for the characters and will suffer in comparison with other crisscrossing L.A. stories such as Crash."
0,Fresh,"Glows on the screen, rich with history."
0,Fresh,"An overall delightful film that will become a gem on your shelf, with stellar performances, a unique script, and stunning directorial choices - A Quiet Place will leave you speechless."
1,Rotten,"Pitch Perfect 3, like so many movies with the dreaded 3 after the title, is a misfire."
0,Fresh,"There were moments when I considered whether this is Brett Ratner's best film. It's really too flawed to allow the word ""best"" to be used. How about, ""it doesn't suck?"""
0,Fresh,One of the three or four best American films of the year.
0,Fresh,"More about humor and hero worship than plot, which is fine, and the movie ambles along mostly at a moderate pace, both a laid-back blessing and its too-lazy curse."
0,Fresh,A Birder's Guide to Everything should be standard issue for anyone looking to relearn the importance of a flock.

1,Rotten,Every book needs an editor.
0,Fresh,"Fast-paced, nonsensical, and often hilarious!"
1,Rotten,"Institutional racism as inspirational melodrama, it's regressive entertainment, our very own Triumph of the Will."
1,Rotten,"With junk like this, only fools rush in."
0,Fresh,"While B-movie humor loses its sheen in later acts, downright vile acts of slasher violence call back to scrub-yourself-clean titles of 80s cable box fame."
0,Fresh,"Calling American Wedding unabashedly and unashamedly crude, lewd and rude is to concede it achieves exactly what it set out to do."
1,Rotten,"Unlike the flowers and the women of Yorkshire, Calendar Girls hits its stride early on, and goes to seed well before we can enjoy its full bloom."
1,Rotten,"Sad to say, Little's magical spell goes poof halfway through."
1,Rotten,This rote buddy-cop action comedy is instantly forgettable.
0,Fresh,"Even at their most inane, Joel and Ethan Coen have managed something that is at the least, more entertaining than most of the other comedic dreck lurking around in the theater."
1,Rotten,This is a movie that thinks the deepest way to engage with the race and class issues it raises is by showing an enlightened white woman ... quoting and then dancing to Bob Marley.
1,Rotten,"The tangled three-way friendship of Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali and Federico Garcia Lorca could make for a fascinating movie. Instead, we have Little Ashes."
1,Rotten,"Ainda que tecnicamente bem realizada e beneficiada pelo charme dos dois personagens-ttulo, esta  uma continuao desnecessria que abandona as mensagens do original e investe numa historinha boba que renda ao estdio um dinheiro fcil."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, not even Sandra Bullock's ability to make us almost forget the ridiculous plot forced upon her can save 'Premonition.'"
0,Fresh,"The kind of horror movie that can't be made in Hollywood today -- serious but not high-minded, meticulously crafted but not showy."
1,Rotten,The latest calcified bore by Sofia Coppola is less pretentious than Marie Antoinette but every bit as inertly stupefying as Lost in Translation.
0,Fresh,A splendid example of how to tackle the daunting duty of turning a beloved work of classic literature into a movie.
0,Fresh,The funniest part of Cuban Fury is that there's actually nothing to laugh at. There's plenty to laugh with instead.
0,Fresh,"Tackling this saga of corporate malfeasance with all comic cylinders firing might have been the only palatable way to present such a downbeat tale. Otherwise, if we weren't busy laughing, we'd be busy crying."
1,Rotten,"For all its hysterical bleating about the pervasive evils of corporate control, The Corporation is itself a conformist piece of propaganda that has its own corporate mindset."
1,Rotten,"One question hovers over the carnage, though: Whom the hell are we supposed to root for? The closest the movie comes to sympathetic assassins are its hit ladies, yet the payoff to their subplot is the weakest of the bunch."
0,Fresh,"Delivers exactly what you'd expect: gushers of blood, ripped flesh by the kilo, and acres of bare booty and boobs (some of them real)."
1,Rotten,There's no difference between the movie and the end-credit outtakes.
0,Fresh,"Writer-director Alex Garland is certainly carving out a niche for himself, with movies in which people literally carve into themselves (or others) to check if they're still human."
0,Fresh,"Often intense but thoroughly likable and relevant. (Writer-director Xavier) Dolan's best film out of the five he has made to date. It is likely premature to call it his masterpiece though, since he is all of 25 years old."
0,Fresh,"OK, I'll get this out of the way: I'm a David Mamet fan."
0,Fresh,"[Craig's] portrayal feels grittier and more complex than previous 007s. This is also partly the result of a better script, by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Oscar winner Paul Haggis, as well as top-notch directing by Martin Campbell."
0,Fresh,The movie is best when it stops trying to be outrageous and simply goes about documenting the awful universals of the food-service experience.
0,Fresh,"An operatic extravaganza of thrilling action and nearly non-stop mayhem ... exhilarating, deranged and exhausting in almost equal measures."
0,Fresh,It's cute and sweet and funny.
1,Rotten,"""Rise of Skywalker"" operates as if the only cinematic tradition at its disposal hails from a galaxy far, far away."

0,Fresh,"If you're looking for something to make you feel good about chubby, cherubic Ted, the venerable lion of the Senate, this is not your movie."
1,Rotten,"On the whole, Baldwin seems pretty dim for a renowned cyber-anarchist. Also, he simply isn't in the same class of actor as Tony Curtis. Or Laurence Fishburne, who swaggers through this mess with his usual suave manliness."
0,Fresh,"The pacing is spot-on, and Fey's Russian guard and Ty Burrell's Interpol agent are wonderful human additions to this comedic romp."
0,Fresh,Take the plunge.
0,Fresh,"Sure, it's just a movie but A Quiet Place is so effective that you'll be deathly afraid of making a sound - just like the main characters."
0,Fresh,"Costner baseball flick is great at motion, not so hot at emotion."
0,Fresh,"With kinetic camera work and dynamic editing, Rodriguez constructs action sequences that leave a lot of big-budget movies in the dust. Besides, the movie's history has become part of its charm."
0,Fresh,"Readers tempted to write off that episode as yet another paranoid fantasy of The Left should take heed: The U.S. vs. John Lennon includes the firsthand testimony of the spies themselves, from apostate FBI agents to the unapologetic G. Gordon Liddy."
0,Fresh,Snatchers is far funnier than most unintended pregnancies and an experience you'll want to enjoy more than once.
0,Fresh,"Retro comedy about doo-wop singers hoping for one last score has great harmony, but lacks a catchy beat."
0,Fresh,Thomas brings a light campy touch as she did in 1995's The Brady Bunch Movie.
1,Rotten,"Decent actors wasted; impossible, idiotic plot twists; an unimaginative shooting style; an okay but unspectacular bit of action. Yep, it's a February movie all right."
1,Rotten,"Apart from Chapman's dry observational tone and the others' silly voices, there's not much here to touch Python fans accustomed to soaring in a higher stratosphere of humour."
0,Fresh,"Take away (the) gratingly whiney soundtrack anthems by Bryan Adams, and Spirit has the heart of a winning animated mini-epic."
1,Rotten,"Maggie is a one-dimensional portrayal of a father coming to terms with his daughter's zombie diagnosis, with ineffectual characters and more tears than emotion."
0,Fresh,"Equal parts suspense thriller, unrequited love story, case study of what binds a marriage, and paramilitary dark op shoot-em-up."
1,Rotten,Mowgli mistakes action for meaning and visual effects as the primary reason to tell a story.

0,Fresh,a thrilling visual experience directed with a very personal style
0,Fresh,"A powerful portrait of emotional endurance, propelled by the outstanding performances of Bassett and Fishburne, both of whom lend a crucial dimension to the gradual redundancies of Kate Lanier's otherwise insightful screenplay."
0,Fresh,Boiling these two romances down to one overlong was simple common sense-- or an act of mercy
0,Fresh,"As a joy ride, 2 days in the Valley is like a drive down Sunset Boulevard in a convertible Cadillac -- so very Valley, it's shallow but fun."
1,Rotten,"The banter ... is thick enough to rake -- and often way too thick to swallow, even for those who might not mind spending a couple hours with a bunch of baby boomers wasting their time by sorting through wasted time in the past."
0,Fresh,The movie also does well to let the supporting characters carry the comedic load.
0,Fresh,"Unusual for this genre, the script doesn't insult the audience's intelligence, and it mercifully soft-pedals its message about the virtues of reading."
0,Fresh,"Mann, Cooke and Cyler deserve to be stars of tomorrow, right now. This film geek's dream of a movie pulls the ground out from under you, but stays smartass to the end. Sweet."
1,Rotten,"Wastes whatever potential it had with bland, jokey dialogue and mediocre action that is expensive yet looks cheap."
0,Fresh,The performances by Michael Sheen and Timothy Spall give the picture the dramatic heft it needs to tackle a narrative far beyond the purview of a standard sports flick.
1,Rotten,"In ""Taking Sides,"" Harvey Keitel has interpreted ""powerful performance"" as loud, aggressive, and singularly one-sided, despoiling an otherwise thought-provoking film."
0,Fresh,"Say what you will about Sex and Lucia, but don't call it boring."

1,Rotten,The homoerotic farewell to what the X-MEN has really been about - the unresolved passion between Xavier and Magneto.
0,Fresh,"It is original and audacious, but the film never soars as I had hoped - one idea is stretched to the limit. Although, what's not to like when hearing 15 of the Beatles' best?"
1,Rotten,Nothing more than Jarmusch's worst film since Night on Earth.
1,Rotten,"Exuberant, colorful, viscerally exciting but overly flashy and sadly disorganized."
0,Fresh,It's hard to shake the feeling that this is merely a lesser rehash of Mendes' more accomplished film American Beauty.

0,Fresh,This may be the best film ever about the effects of divorce on children.
0,Fresh,"This matter-of-fact thriller disdains sensationalism. Yet, the situations have you holding your breath as each new challenge or obstacle impedes the astronauts as they use their knowledge to find ways to stay alive."
1,Rotten,"With all the film's technical efficiency, the introduction of the black-clad internet trolls/criminals does not work. Their presence pixelates the screen, taking us out of the action. It's a step too far, instead of making us wonder..."
1,Rotten,"The film's biggest problem, though, is that it spends so much time in a vacuous Hollywood demimonde that some of the emptiness inevitably rubs off."
0,Fresh,"With a running time of 99 minutes, Plus One is a charming and delightful take on the romcom. A refreshing and spirited sorbet to the many saccharine movies that pop up around this time of year."
0,Fresh,"A coming-of-age tale conveyed with deftly handled emotional complexity and chilling thematic subtext, Raw is above all else a gut twisting work of classic body horror."
0,Fresh,"An inspiring drama about a man who possesses great perseverance, a spiritual character quality that includes patience, flexibility, and resilience in the face of challenges and constant change."
1,Rotten,Indistinguishable from an Afterschool Special.
0,Fresh,"What makes The Incredible Jessica James stand out-other than terrific performances from Williams and co-stars- is in the effort it puts towards being a romantic comedy that emphasizes the ""comedy"" part."
0,Fresh,There is something thrilling about Loach's dedication to exposing the horror and mind-numbing pointlessness of bureaucracy with as little drama as possible.
1,Rotten,Munich rarely rises above its own predictability to become more than a noble failure.
0,Fresh,The tone of documentary accuracy makes the film even darker.
1,Rotten,Leviathan is mostly a test of the viewer's nerves and endurance that imparts little knowledge about its ostensible subject matter.
1,Rotten,"Clearly, this is a subject Jordan cares about passionately, but he hasn't found a form to make us share his passion. Unless you come to Michael Collins with strong feelings about its hero, it's unlikely you will be deeply engaged."
0,Fresh,A wholly magical experience - a refreshingly old fashioned fable for the young and the young at heart.
1,Rotten,"Never scary, but manages to squeeze some effective gore and several laughs out of its derivative little soul."
0,Fresh,"Look at it from an entertainment standpoint. What you'll find is that it's a very entertaining, sometimes very funny and always extremely playful film."
0,Fresh,This is a sequel that easily surpasses its predecessor by turning its previously dull hero into one with unexpected but logical depth.
1,Rotten,I couldn't find much humor in this supposed dark comedy.
1,Rotten,"It wants to be a thinking man's action movie, but it's really a by-the-numbers revenge movie for people who thought The Butterfly Effect was profound."
1,Rotten,"A flat, boring, and simple-minded fantasy flick about the battle between the dark forces and the forces of light and goodness."
1,Rotten,"Within Clay Pigeons is a smaller story that might have involved us more, but it's buried by overkill."
0,Fresh,"There are no wasted moments here. There are no wasted characters. The film is as much about Martin Luther King Jr. as it is about the people he worked with, and fought for."
0,Fresh,"As a Disney fan, it is also neat to see many of the legendary animators like Lee and Mary Blair, Walt Disney, Frank Thomoas, Norman Ferguson, and more in the film."
0,Fresh,"Contrary to what some critics have said, this is a taut thriller with a conclusion that is not ""risible"" but credible and cathartic."
1,Rotten,"One of those almost unbearably classy movies, like A Man for All Seasons and Becket, that have a way of elevating the reputations of moviemakers without doing much for the art."
1,Rotten,"Eleven-year old boys may very well enjoy Dragonball: Evolution, but anyone outside that target demographic might well be advised to skip it."
1,Rotten,"A delightfully underplayed turn from Michel Piccoli as a newly-elected Pope paralysed by feelings of inadequacy, a large dose of widescreen confidence and some moments of delicate human observation fail to make up for the unresolved feel."
0,Fresh,The most gutbustingly weird comedy since Being John Malkovich.
1,Rotten,The plot? Wish you hadn't asked.
1,Rotten,"Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder, however, Kilmer seems to be posing, rather than acting. And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea."
0,Fresh,"When they're on-screen together, it's better than electrifying -- it's rhapsodic."
0,Fresh,A great story and a wonderful cast combine to make this drama a must-see.
0,Fresh,"For all its taut direction and editing, its thunderous sound and its historic origins, the film doesn't quite move us as deeply and as often as we expect. Perhaps Nolan is trying too hard to construct the mood with the tools at his command."
0,Fresh,"With its gorgeous big-sky vistas, stirring shots of the majestic mustangs and intimate bits between trainers and trainees, ""Wild Horse"" proves a warm and memorable ride."
1,Rotten,"Although ""Kin"" doesn't cut it, some of its ideas are worthy of further development."
0,Fresh,"""The Fits"" is unlike any dance film you'll ever see, which doesn't automatically make it good, just different. The film suffers from being diminutively compelling throughout, regardless of how deeply under your skin the score gets."
0,Fresh,"Bullock seems to really be enjoying herself in this role, and Affleck is uncomfortable. I don't know whether this is because his role dictates it or if it's just a natural reaction, but it works."
0,Fresh,Trumps Hotel Rwanda in its you-are-there immediacy and unflinching gaze.
0,Fresh,"There's something unshakable about it, and something remarkable about the fact that it exists at all."
1,Rotten,"After repeated taunts to ""Bring it,"" increasing evidence of the barely-there story, and a war's worth of bullets and fireballs, The Expendables gets pretty tiresome."
1,Rotten,"In a film where ghostly children attempt to force other kids to watch horror movies only to be repeatedly told ""I don't' want to"", this somehow manages to be a microcosm for Sinister 2. I don't want to watch any more either."
0,Fresh,"May not be the most smoothly organized documentary of the year, but it certainly fires a lot of arrows at its target."
0,Fresh,"Movies like this don't need to be smart, they just need to be entertaining, and The Purge: Anarchy is, if nothing else, entertaining."
0,Fresh,"Without any narrative heft, these sights don't last in the mind much longer than they linger on screen. And yet they thrill in short-lived bursts that Singh doles out carefully, keeping pace with the audience's appetite."
0,Fresh,It builds suspense as it unfolds in real time--which is the film's biggest asset.
1,Rotten,"Big Fish has a hook, a line, but it's a sinker."
0,Fresh,"Happy Happy Joy Joy makes it clear it wasn't just Kricfalusis that made Ren & Stimpy special, it was a collaborative effort with the crew that shaped it into a classic."
0,Fresh,"While the film sorely misses the guiding hand of director Whale, it has enough of the old Universal atmosphere to be of interest."
0,Fresh,"It's all a bit mad, but ultimately rather moving."
0,Fresh,"Between Russell Crowe (after he lightens up a bit...), Cate Blanchett and Max von Sydow, the acting chops are formidable."
1,Rotten,"Some of the talent - like The Hangover's Ed Helms - manage to escape with their dignity, just about intact, but the film's attempts to justify its adult rating become increasingly desperate."
1,Rotten,It does not prove to be an ultimately rewarding experience.
0,Fresh,Certain Women's whispers are more penetrating than most film's shouts.
0,Fresh,"Savages is Oliver Stone doing what he should have done a long time ago: making a tricky, amoral, down-and-dirty crime thriller that's blessedly free of any social, topical, or political relevance."
0,Fresh,The most interesting interpretation of Romeo and Juliet since Baz Luhrmann's groundbreaking 1996 version.
0,Fresh,Matthew Goode delivers a wonderful performance as Tom. He's a character that you want to sympathise with but he makes it difficult with some of his not-so-likeable outbursts.
0,Fresh,Anyone who's ever had a little girl will have a difficult time not liking the film.
1,Rotten,"""Vacation"" attempts to recreate the charm of the classic with actors who know how to read the lines but don't embody the characters. And they're forced to speak within a lazily written story that doesn't add enough to justify coming back."
0,Fresh,This mouthy express train of a movie has giddy charm to burn.
0,Fresh,"It is a thoroughly valuable and absorbing film, with some terrifically managed suspense sequences that might conceivably have been admired by Gillo Pontecorvo."
1,Rotten,"I, Frankenstein leaves itself open to be franchised, but the chances of that happening are equal to Eckhart putting this film at the top of his resume."
0,Fresh,"The drummer boy is a misanthrope who hates all of humanity, which makes for a surprisingly entertaining character to follow around. Rankin/Bass was terrified of playing up the darker sides of its characters. It shouldn't have been."
0,Fresh,Ejiofor's performance masterfully walks the line between showing Northrup's unbowed spirit and giving him superhuman levels of fortitude.
0,Fresh,"History, mystery and romance come together like a fine dance in this superb period drama."
1,Rotten,"The Equalizer 2 tries hard to re-create that primal red-meat formula, but it takes far too long puttering around to really deliver the exploitation goods. Just get to the equalizing already!"
0,Fresh,A wonderfully drawn and utterly charming portrait of dysfunction that doubles as a curious love letter to the American family.
0,Fresh,"Not the best animated film of 2017, but lyrical enough to warrant its nomination"
1,Rotten,"The idea of picking up the Robin Hood legend 20 years later seems okay at first consideration, but Goldman and Lester never got beyond the premise."
0,Fresh,"Combine the characters, the story, the message, and the acting, and it's easy to see why It's a Wonderful Life isn't just a holiday favorite, but a great movie by almost any standards."
1,Rotten,It barely matters that Zombie Strippers is a tediously overextended satire. It's called Zombie Strippers.
0,Fresh,"There are some clever and nicely conceived sequences, and some bursts of wit - though given the writing firepower involved, there should really have been more wit."
0,Fresh,"Like the pounding waves that recur throughout, this is a vibrant and confident feature debut for the director, and her arrival on cinema's shores signals big things ahead."

0,Fresh,So creepy it had me squirming in my seat.
1,Rotten,"Filmmaker Love brings these characters to vivid life, but they're all so hateful, racist and idiotic that we don't like them at all!"
1,Rotten,A scattershot cop comedy that aims its parodistic firepower not at any single target -- least of all its namesake -- but at an entire decade.
0,Fresh,"Weaves its power through, instead of above us, in the effort of its own testament that the inner horrors of our time on Earth should be a uniter and not a divider, no matter who the decider might be."
0,Fresh,"If Oscar overlooks Franco, it would be a travesty. It would also be a shame to avoid seeing 127 Hours simply because the subject matter makes you wince."
1,Rotten,"Gathering together the distinguished selection of Hudson, Dickinson, and Savalas for a story so deliciously eccentric is perhaps its greatest success."
1,Rotten,I just couldn't get behind the characters.
0,Fresh,"Certainly, there's a comedy to be made about multigenerational conflict. But ""Peace, Love & Misunderstanding"" never quite finds its groove."
1,Rotten,"As an expression of from-the-gut anti-war rage, Redacted is admirable, but as art, it's undercooked."
1,Rotten,This dopey piece of fantastical folklore takes a long time to get to its awe-inspiring ending.
1,Rotten,Katniss looked tired and emotional throughout most of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 and the tiredness was definitely contagious!
0,Fresh,"Poetic, bewitched, disturbing and unforgettable."
0,Fresh,"Snowden is a solid, yet unremarkable, portrayal of an intriguing incident that asks the audience to contemplate serious questions."
0,Fresh,A classic example of how much an audience can forgive if there's a great opening and terrific ending.
1,Rotten,"The lead performances of Brooks, MacDowell, and Stone are critical to the story's success, and ultimately fall flat."
0,Fresh,Hayley Mills rocks in her dual role as twins.
0,Fresh,The film is a searing portrait of collective denial - a diagnosis from which Ms. Schwartz doesn't exempt herself.
1,Rotten,"If any movie proves that Mel Brooks' genius for skewering creaky genres has evaporated, it's this anemic attempt to draw new blood from low-flying vampire high jinks."
0,Fresh,"It's the sort of impressionistic pastiche, the tweaking of iconic Americana, that defines so much of the Coens' best work. The other chapters have their moments"
0,Fresh,"The movie gives thoughtful viewers plenty to ponder, and plenty of situations in the story have two right answers, but no definitive one."
1,Rotten,"I loved Ferrell in Stranger Than Fiction; liked him in Old School and Talladega Nights. Yet, except for a skyhook or two, his work in Semi-Pro is strictly amateur."
0,Fresh,"Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are perfectly cast in this movie, and Winslet's Oscar nomination was well-deserved. The writing, direction and acting are all top-notch."
0,Fresh,"Dragonslayer is an amazing window into a particular part of the culture and how we live now. You'll think about Skreech -- his father's day gift for his son, his new job at a bowling alley -- for a long time after you leave the theatre."
1,Rotten,The story turns the Messiah into a family therapist who reveals his own neuroses in snippy exchanges with the Devil about their Father.
0,Fresh,"Several beautifully intercut musical numbers keep the action moving and the dialogue in between is sweet, tart and subversive."
0,Fresh,"While there's nothing unusual about seeing a teenager trying to break free of the unindividuated and invisible state of childhood, the way in which it unfolds in Eliza Hittman's debut feature is deeply uncomfortable."
0,Fresh,"It's a lovely attitude in an engaging dramedy, and I hope Mendes has a few more of these within him before he lurches back to the dark side of human behavior."
0,Fresh,...captures the madness of a societal menace without ever losing sight of his humanity.
0,Fresh,"Ayckbourn's quintessentially British tale of death and infidelity in rural Yorkshire translates surprisingly well into Resnais' auteurist form, making for a delightful postmodern experiment in the intertextuality of art."
0,Fresh,"While PONTYPOOL is a thought-provoking and suspenseful film, some of the flaws will really take the audience out of the movie."
1,Rotten,"You can detect a flicker - one might even say a ghost - of an interesting idea beneath its polished shell. But at every turn, Ghost in the Shell sacrifices the opportunity to actually say something interesting."
1,Rotten,The laziest and least inspiring of movie genres has gone self-referential.
0,Fresh,It is Colin Farrell as villainous Bullseye who steals the show.
1,Rotten,I found it sucrose and glib.
0,Fresh,"Yes, there is quiet, but there is calm within moments of stress and strain and trying just to keep it together through the day in a rural world where you still have to deal with other people... It all flows like cool, clear water."
1,Rotten,"Coming from a filmmaker capable of wowing with his visual flair, Wonderstruck fails to illicit much wonder .... This one could have been a heck of a lot better."
0,Fresh,Maddeningly uneven but mildly amusing.
1,Rotten,"Beyond the philosophizing, Mean Girls is a standard collection of low comic jokes ... and a vindication / revenge fantasy directed at moviegoers who are still sad the popular kids didn't like them back in the day."
0,Fresh,"Matt Scudder, say hello to Dirty Harry. I think he got here first, but welcome aboard."
0,Fresh,"Ohana means family, and family in this fun and feisty 2002 animated Disney feature means a little Hawaiian girl, her caretaker sister, the sister's boyfriend, and a mutated monster of an alien that little Lilo adopts, thinking he's a dog."
0,Fresh,"The Shaun the Sheep Movie manages to be smart, moving and hilarious without the inclusion of a single word of dialogue."
1,Rotten,Part of the pleasure of the film is supposed to be the anachronisms. But most of the fun is in the first part of the film and the anachronisms long outlast the fun.
0,Fresh,"On par with Little Children in terms of the writing and performances, including one of Kate Beckinsale's shining moments."
0,Fresh,A satisfying and often exciting film.
1,Rotten,"By the time the last reel has unraveled, so has the movie, whose endless puzzles keep accumulating until the ideas that once fueled them have turned on themselves."
1,Rotten,"It's all you can do not to laugh. Oh, go ahead. But be forewarned that there are many miles to go before we get to the end and it will feel like an eternity before any of it makes sense."
1,Rotten,The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads.
1,Rotten,"Compltement manqu, drivatif et souvent ridicule."
0,Fresh,"An engaging and frequently moving drama with strong performances and a handful of genuinely stunning sequences, not to mention some world class horse-wrangling."
0,Fresh,"Abrams had a responsibility that most other action film directors never need to worry about. He succeeds in parts, maybe enough for the young, modern audiences for whom the film has been made, but old Trekkies may have some issues."
0,Fresh,"Bold and entertaining, this is not as sleek or clever as X-Men:First Class, but makes up for those lapses with McAvoy's fiercely emotional performance and dazzling set pieces."

0,Fresh,"Pixar's best feature... As fresh as it is funny, as heartwarming as it is innovative."
0,Fresh,The type of gem you trot out when you want to share something offbeat and intelligent.
1,Rotten,"An incredibly frustrating drama that starts off promisingly, featuring a talented ensemble, but devolves into too much repetitive rhetoric and a predictable non-conclusion."
0,Fresh,"It'd all be for naught if not for the excellent script by Michael Lloyd Green, who puts us so firmly in Daughter's shoes that it almost doesn't matter that we've seen several of these tropes before."
1,Rotten,"Eventually, it's all too apparent that nothing here really works. Even at 82-minutes, much of the film feels like wheel-spinning."
0,Fresh,An enjoyable comedy about three avid birders who wind up as competitors on a quest to see who can spot the most species of birds in North America
0,Fresh,"When that music swells, it's as infectious as it was in 1991."
1,Rotten,"Nolan's aesthetically beautiful, large-scale sci-fi drama is admirable in its ideas and style, but lacking in its storytelling and execution."
0,Fresh,"Although nothing really happens throughout the 93-minute run time, the emotional conflicts that envelop the character of Camille kept me wondering, too - why is she there?"
0,Fresh,"Help! is a Beatles movie, but even without the fab four, it would be an important film."
0,Fresh,"A film which, mobile phone-related plot aside, feels like it was written in the Eighties and simply sat on a shelf waiting for the cost of filming in this style to come down, Nekrotronic will appeal to fans of period genre works."
0,Fresh,"Two parts sheer brilliance, one part contrived mess."
1,Rotten,This plays like an early George Romero shocker but without Romero's humor or social commentary.

0,Fresh,"Not quite the animated masterpiece one would expect of Disney of old, but nonetheless a step in the right direction."
1,Rotten,"It's billed as a 'Hitchcockian thriller,' but frankly I see nothing either Hitchcockian nor thrilling this same-old Gallic tale..."
0,Fresh,Bittersweet and heartbreaking; words can't describe the simultaneous emotional devastation and wide-smiled happiness induced by the ending
0,Fresh,Of interest to anyone keen on laughing outloud at a charming comedy.
1,Rotten,Where originality goes to get mowed down by a Tommy gun.
0,Fresh,"multitudes seem to be going wild over Hedwig from Sundance to Berlin. Maybe this is the decade of the botched singing sex change. If so, it's nothing to complain about."
0,Fresh,"The story is moving, the acting remarkable and the music glorious, which makes The Song of Names worth waiting out its wobbly start."
0,Fresh,"The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion applies bone-crunching, blood-spurting action to the cinematic trend of super-gifted teens discovering their powers/true origins."

1,Rotten,"Far from fleshing out the universe of THE MATRIX, this cynical, self-indulgent marketing tie-in renders it less coherent. Boasts only a few memorable visual moments, and suffers from a paucity of narrative."
0,Fresh,"The film is mostly in black-and-white, and in a style that draws as much from Charlie Brown as from the style of the novel or the legacy of the German Expressionists."
1,Rotten,An exploitative and upsetting domestic thriller.
1,Rotten,"Meehl's documentary features plenty of interviews with cowboys and ranch hands who've had their lives changed by Brannaman, but it lacks the literary or cinematic magic of either version of The Horse Whisperer."

0,Fresh,It's refreshingly snarky and quick.
0,Fresh,The movie ends up being just sharp enough at its peaks to be frustrating in its valleys. But the laughs are there.
1,Rotten,"It's difficult to discuss the true limitations of the film without exposing a wealth of spoilers, but it seems Ridley Scott has already spoiled enough by returning to the realm of his finest work without a clear exit strategy."
0,Fresh,A worthy end to the series.
0,Fresh,"Obscene, is melancholic. The eerie contradiction is how chirpy and cheery this remarkable activist, and self-confessed sex addict, is at more than 80 years of age."
1,Rotten,The dilemmas faced by the characters on screen have no greater urgency than those faced by the actors in television commercials.
1,Rotten,The Men Who Stare at Goats is a magical-realist sitcom war farce that ends up being about nothing but its own slovenly smugness.
0,Fresh,May not take you into the unknown ... but it's a worthy-enough sequel that will ironically play strongest to older kids and adults who are spiritually equipped to handle its developing themes.
1,Rotten,There's very little to care about between appearances of the title creature.
0,Fresh,Imagine a clever cartoonist turning his pen from the politicians to these [Twilight] characters and you'll get some idea of the fun that can be had
0,Fresh,An entertaining and serviceable adaptation. Dennis Storhoi delivers an awesome performance. Weak aspects of story made up for by great action.
1,Rotten,"It's original, it's compelling, and it's completely mediocre."
0,Fresh,"Its impressive animation and fluid action sequences make it more than a passable two + hours, but it never becomes the great achievement it could -- and perhaps should -- have been."
0,Fresh,"It's not Barfly, but it'll do. Cheers."
0,Fresh,"Woozy, boozy, sleazy and dreamy, it's impossible not to be seduced by The Master - and, indeed, the master."
0,Fresh,"The picture is methodically constructed, to the point that it's sometimes dull. But here and there it sets off a mini charge, building up to a subtly satisfying conclusion."
0,Fresh,As long as it takes
0,Fresh,The essence of Mann.
0,Fresh,A documentary more perturbing than any horror film. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,An inspiring and well-acted film about an extraordinary African-American debating team in the 1930s with the talent and determination to excel.
1,Rotten,"It quickly becomes exhausting in adhering to its many lessons, all mostly about how women can manipulate the men in their lives to treat them better."
0,Fresh,Still better than most Sandler-written movies.
0,Fresh,"It's a stylish and amusing thriller, but a hollow one, with mostly broad-stroke characters populating an otherwise ultra-detailed fictional criminal underworld."
1,Rotten,"While the film is completely unpretentious and moves at a pleasant pace, it's also lightweight."
0,Fresh,"Another groundbreaker in horror from Hereditary's Ari Aster who mixes a modern breakup story with pagan rituals in Sweden. If you're looking for the scariest movie ever shot in blinding sunlight, the raw and riveting Midsommar is it."
0,Fresh,Black Panther isn't just a great movie for the first half of the year; Black Panther is the best movie Marvel's ever made!
0,Fresh,"Sophie Okonedo beautifully portrays Laing as a confused and scared young woman who's forced to choose a color line, but not without her share of heartache and pain."
1,Rotten,[Scores] only a handful of genuine laughs during its scant 78 minutes.
1,Rotten,"Written, disappointingly, by Wes Craven and his son Jonathan, this limp sequel to last year's remake of Wes' 1977 original feels like the work of a guy who's spent a few too many days lost in the desert."
0,Fresh,"I expect to roll my eyes several times while the kids consume their dose of morality. In contrast, El Dorado skips the preaching and focuses more on the comedy."
0,Fresh,"The film contains every established action device: exploding buildings (when a car is no longer enough), apocalyptic threat (a perennial theme in Cameron's work), and a villain with no apparent vulnerability."
1,Rotten,"Relentlessly dour, filled with unsympathetic characters, and made out of cardboard melodrama. It's the last of those sins that is unforgivable. [Blu-ray]"
0,Fresh,"A decent but not great version that makes Shakespeare's reliable play accessible, but the acting is uneven: Branagh is witty as Iago, Fishburne looks but doesn't sound right, and Jacob is pale as Desdemona."
0,Fresh,Unveils rarely seen glimpses of Saudi culture
0,Fresh,I suppose the sign of a good documentary is if it can remind me that my own problems are relatively small and I am very lucky.
0,Fresh,There is style and subtlety in this film and it makes me look forward to what Sam Taylor Wood does next.
0,Fresh,Thankfully there is Bill Nighy playing Bill Nighy. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Sayles' unabashedly partisan film moseys along in an unhurried fashion, encompassing myriad story lines yet taking the trouble to fully develop each of its many characters."
0,Fresh,"The best performance, appropriately, comes from the actor you probably haven't heard of: Austin Abrams."
1,Rotten,A routine rescue mission drama.
0,Fresh,"Everly has the heaving, bloody bosoms of an exploitation flick, yet Hayek gives the character powerful dignity. She's no victim, nor an off-the-shelf ""strong woman."""
1,Rotten,An emotionally uninvolving black comedy about an aged actor who is in a funk about everything.
0,Fresh,"Scream 4 will either fail your high expectations or go above your low ones. Whichever it is, just please don't call it Scre4m."
1,Rotten,"This movie is ""Sin City's"" evil twin. Disguised to look clever but underneath boring as hell."
0,Fresh,"Katyn is a sobering experience, at times harrowing. It's also extraordinarily compassionate, even as Wajda vents his rage about what happened and the lies that followed."
0,Fresh,A movie of great delicacy of feeling... [T]he truth of the story tugs irresistibly at your heart.
1,Rotten,All the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling.
0,Fresh,"For those who can stomach ever-escalating scenes of brutality, generous amounts of B-movie gore and a story with dialogue that is sometimes dumbfounding, ""Hobo"" is a hero."
0,Fresh,...a serviceable and nostalgic coming-of-age kiddie comedy that resonates...has enough heart and soul to capture the giddy delight of its festive confines.
1,Rotten,"Andy Lau faces an explosive situation in a tunnel, starring and producing Herman Yau's biggest film to date, though disappointingly one-dimensional..."
0,Fresh,"Secrets are revealed. Tears are shed. One revelation leads to the next, but never once does the story seem gratuitous."
1,Rotten,Everybody gets naked and plays electronic Hacky Sack or something. All attendees are required to keep a video diary of everything they do.
0,Fresh,If it was made today it would probably be tawdry and tasteless but here it strikes just the right note.
0,Fresh,"A story well told about lessons well learned, and if Clint wants to keep making more like them, he should."
0,Fresh,"Fred Ward plays dumb hicks a lot, but never with quite this much comedic energy."
1,Rotten,There's nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure. We all have them: Those movies that we know suck that we can't help but watch on cable every time they come on. But they still SUCK.
1,Rotten,Ms McCarthy deserves better.
1,Rotten,"Hall Pass is such a tiring and dispiriting enterprise in and of itself that using it as a potential springboard to contemplate why the Farrellys no longer 'matter' ... well, it just seems not to matter."
0,Fresh,"Sort of like the daytime version of Barfly's nights, Factotum is a trifle, but one filled with amusing, even touching moments."
0,Fresh,"The plentiful laughs are obvious and broad, yet they mostly play."
0,Fresh,"You probably need to spend more time than I do on sites such as TMZ to get all the jokes, but the film nails the oversharing banality of YouTube celebrity."
0,Fresh,Welcome to Sarajevo isn't just the story of an outsider's perspective of the conflict; it's a compelling examination of the role the media played in reporting and shaping the average person's views of the war.
0,Fresh,"An interesting, amusing, and cleverly composed story of first love..."
1,Rotten,"""Suffragette"" feels like a documentary in its visuals, but at the same time drowns in subjectivity."
0,Fresh,"""Superfly"" escapes superficiality thanks largely to strong performances from Jackson; Jason Mitchell as Priest's workmanlike partner, Eddie, and Michael Kenneth Williams as Priest's mentor, Scatter."
0,Fresh,Östlund uses deft editing and musical cues to place an ironic frame around the couple's decidedly first-world problems.
1,Rotten,"Though young kids are as wowed as their parents by three-dimensional effects, neither age group has an attention span long enough to sit through this yawner."
1,Rotten,"For a film about the benefits of natural food and raw milk, there is ironically nothing organic about Farmageddon."
0,Fresh,A charming French spy farce replete with homoerotic undertones
0,Fresh,Ocean's Eight is a thoroughly enjoyable heist movie and a fun watch without the need to see cars wrecked or explosions. Slick and glamorous...women can lead a heist movie
0,Fresh,A loving Buena Vista Social Club -style hymn to the rhythm and life of salsa.
0,Fresh,"A vivid, visceral reminder of just how exciting an action film can be."
0,Fresh,We can see why Warner Bros. decided to move it up a couple of months for the awards season.
0,Fresh,"Swinton, her hair white and long and her eyes tired and kind, and Hiddleston, moody and resigned, are wonderful - delivering their lines with the dry sighs of a desert breeze."
0,Fresh,"A world which conveys the best and worst about shopping: carnal, animalistic, beautiful, frightening and blackly funny, with as many touchable moments as teachable ones."
0,Fresh,"A quiet film, but it sneaks up on you, gaining in emotional urgency as it goes on."
0,Fresh,"Jarecki constructs the documentary in the same way a mystery writer would plot a brainteasing novel. After the first half-hour, you'll have strong impressions of Arnold, Elaine and their sons Jesse and David ...those initial thoughts are likely to change."
1,Rotten,"Simultaneously silly, ostentatious and terribly boring."
0,Fresh,This is a good looking film with strong performances and a rich musical score by Thomas Newman ('Skyfall'). but there are certain narrative and structural problems that hold it back.
0,Fresh,"Spanish romcom about love, family has drinking and sex."
1,Rotten,"I didn't think it was possible to make a movie involving Vikings worse than 1978's The Norsemen starring Lee Majors, but director Marcus Nispel and company have accomplished just that with this formulaic piece of poorly made PC trash."
0,Fresh,"A tense thriller full of great performances, ""The Town"" is a heist film that rivals ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""Heat."""
0,Fresh,Offers a glimpse of what happened in 1991 as Milosovich bulldozed his way into power over the corpses of his enemies.
1,Rotten,Even the look seems to be at odds with the material.
0,Fresh,"Superman is a polished piece of advocacy filmmaking, even if it lacks the rock-star charisma of Al Gore."
0,Fresh,"Fonda's physical presence throughout the film is a thing of magic, as he seems to glide from one position to the next, never looking awkward even when he is bent in three places to fit within the frame."
0,Fresh,A tour de force of emotionally aching transcendence and nearly unbearable slow-boiling dread and tension.
0,Fresh,"Newman is always at his best portraying slightly disreputable characters such as Hud, Butch Cassidy and Fast Eddie Felson. Where the Money Is proves there's plenty of life in the old (75) boy yet."
1,Rotten,"The story hits a wall with an abrupt, dismal ending."
0,Fresh,"The first of the three battle setpieces... gave me particular thrills, as a fan of both superhero action and brilliant actors."
1,Rotten,"The predictable end, which comes with an abruptness that feels altogether too constructed, completes the fantasy of transgression that's at the heart of the movie's appeal, however elaborate the trappings."
0,Fresh,It skillfully accomplishes the horror genre's most basic goal: scaring the hell out of you.
0,Fresh,This may be the first movie to capture the reckless exuberance of Pulp Fiction without seeming like a blatant rip-off.
1,Rotten,Audiences who have been wondering when we were going to get a great comedy about incest can keep wondering.
1,Rotten,A load of overwrought nonsense in which the souls of seven twentysomethings are imperilled when they disturb the undead quietly mouldering in the basement.
0,Fresh,This fantastical fable takes aim at marketing itself with an intriguing if tendentious narrative.
0,Fresh,"Although Posey renders Susan's instability and dominance with gusto, the character's vulnerability and pain are manifest."
0,Fresh,"Treat yourself, and seek out this film."
1,Rotten,"One of those cool concept, lackluster execution films that capsizes what could have been a very clever and fun film."
0,Fresh,"Eastwood scales back his style and rhetoric this time around, though not his earnestness."
1,Rotten,"A tearjerker piled on a tearjerker...a gloomily mawkish, manipulative soap opera that uses the sad historical context in a way many will consider offensive."
0,Fresh,"Director Brian Robbins keeps the special effects and animatronics to a minimum, relying more often than not on real (albeit trained) dogs. That extra bit of authenticity is refreshing."
1,Rotten,To approach spirituality on screen and maintain a sense of enchantment is a hurdle many a filmmaker have fallen over - and it's one that Stuart Hazeldine has struggled with.
1,Rotten,Drags a 60-minute B-movie premise into something twice that long.
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American, a decision that plucks ""The Four Feathers"" bare."
1,Rotten,"Princeton must have thought this film could help its reputation. It's more likely to increase applications to Yale, Harvard and MIT."
1,Rotten,"The movie has a certain mordant humor, and some macho dialogue that's funny... But the movie is not scary, and the plot is just one gory showdown after another."
0,Fresh,"""...A post-John Hughes innovator as a teen flick that ducks both Afterschool Special-isms and crass humour..."""

0,Fresh,"There's plenty of evident, if nascent talent."
0,Fresh,Visually stunning and darker than expected.
1,Rotten,"While it has its amusing moments, the uneven pace, underplotted scripting and over-reliance on improvisation eventually take their combined toll."
0,Fresh,An often thrilling piece of oriental- meets- occidental hokum.
0,Fresh,The film refreshingly portrays its kids as part of a diverse group trying to succeed in a country in which they can never find secure footing.
0,Fresh,The Way Way Back relishes in burying its protagonist in a hole so the audience can feel elation while he digs himself out again.
0,Fresh,"A stunning philosophical film without compromise. Lowery's A GHOST STORY is so original, daring and slow that it returns the medium of film into the hands of the director."
0,Fresh,"a thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride, enough to keep you scared when you go home and try to go asleep with all the lights out and the house going bump in the night"
0,Fresh,"To call it a great film would be to oversell it, but as a fun, fascinating work of kinetic art, a 100-minute visual spectacle, it's a knockout."
0,Fresh,"[This] is an exemplary, deeply humanist entry in the secular mythmaking genre."
0,Fresh,An absorbing (if admittedly flawed) thought-piece. It engaged me throughout and I found the ending to be surprisingly hopeful.
0,Fresh,"Prince Caspian is rife with Christian metaphors and mythology. Well, they're there if you choose to see them."
1,Rotten,Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany.
0,Fresh,"There's nothing original here, but the film is pleasant enough, and it's a pleasure to see Elizondo on the screen again. Pea, Obradors and Mello are fine as well."
1,Rotten,"Though beautiful to look at and graced with moments of ticklish camp, The Skin I Live In is also sluggish, arbitrarily conceived and, especially in its sagging middle, unaccountably dull."
0,Fresh,"Cinematographer Stefan Duscio's camerawork is crafty, often focusing on empty frames and spaces where Adrian might be hiding, so that every scene becomes instantly tense."
0,Fresh,Highlighted by two strong leads and solid support work but hamstrung by a low-budget sense of period and some soapy dramatics.
0,Fresh,"""Hail, Caesar!"" remains charming and intermittently hilarious, but there's a suspicious lack of oomph here, with Coen Brothers noticeably winded during this highly specific juggling act."
0,Fresh,"Although the ending is a let-down, it's still interesting to see the lessons luck ultimately teaches each of the characters."
0,Fresh,[The characters] get more charming by the minute.
1,Rotten,I needed more than paint-by-numbers scripting to fill in the blanks between those legendary speeches.
0,Fresh,"A technically compelling Hitchcock film which, while made early in his career and rather crude, displays his genius at creating visual suspense."
1,Rotten,"Crime thriller or offbeat family drama? Darkly funny or way too dreary? Trespass has all of these elements, and ultimately, this thick stew is unsatisfying."
1,Rotten,"The biggest problem is the script, which rarely rings true and is full of trite little phrases."
1,Rotten,"Teen Spirit would have benefited greatly from adding some interesting background color, instead of solely focusing on the cold character at center-stage."
0,Fresh,A corny but enjoyable disaster flick which makes up for what it lacks in polished CGI with a rattling pace and plenty of bracingly authentic scenes of screaming passenger panic.
1,Rotten,The dialogue sounds as if Allen hasn't been out of doors in the past 30 years. The characters are stale stage archetypes. And the all-star cast he's rounded up to play the parts often recognize this.
1,Rotten,Mills needs to look up from the lint that's collected in his navel.
1,Rotten,"Eclipse, like its two predecessors, is ham-fisted and obvious, a mass-market entertainment with a frustrating lack of imagination, anemic plotting (how were those novels so fat?) and no aspirations toward anything greater than box office ka-ching."
1,Rotten,"A well-intentioned look at a fraught issue, but the Damon-Krasinski screenplay ultimately opts for Hollywood oversimplification."
1,Rotten,Mamet makes movies for people who love hearing themselves talk.
0,Fresh,The Lost City of Z(ed) isn't as expansive as you might initially wish but still pulls you in and along.
0,Fresh,"Rather than some rambling, pro-pot film, this flick actually does a pretty good job of documenting the issues surrounding Chong's arrest, and the obvious intention by the Ashcroft justice department to bring down an icon of the debauched 70s."
0,Fresh,an antidote to this year's cinematic doldrums - a gag-inducing celebration of stupidity
0,Fresh,Its subject is so inherently likable that a feature-length dose of Trejo's boundless energy feels like the kind of adrenaline shot we can use right about now.
0,Fresh,"There are ceramic cardinals mounted on the wall, and Zingers on top of the refrigerator; but there are dark woods here, and they're just beyond the family's backyard deck..."
0,Fresh,Drags its all-star cast through soap-opera melodramatics of a very high order.

0,Fresh,The film has a lean cast and a very intimate feel.
0,Fresh,"Scary Movie 4 isn't a comedy classic, but it's still about five times as funny as Scary Movie 3."
1,Rotten,"The pint-sized version of World Wrestling Entertainment on display here is sport as child pornography, one in which the participating minors and their sanctioning parents are complicit."
0,Fresh,The film gets more mileage out of its setup than I thought possible.
0,Fresh,"Elvis' debut in movies, and not a bad production. Set in Civil War with nice title song."
0,Fresh,Strives to unite old and new generations of Star Wars fans and mostly succeeds.
0,Fresh,"Sunday Bloody Sunday is the song of those left behind, not the one doing the leaving."
1,Rotten,[It] isn't an absolutely awful movie. It has a diverse cast and is clearly trying to make a statement about women being able to be business together without being catty...but it's unclear which goals the film prioritizes...
1,Rotten,"Larter is just about average. Salman hasn't looked worse, with a plastic smile, a faraway look and a fake, incomprehensible accent that forces one to demand subtitles."
0,Fresh,Is it trash or art? Maybe it's a bit of both. It's certainly one of the most 'alive' films out there.
1,Rotten,"Has there ever been a time when I wanted the hero to die so badly, as badly as in this film? No."
0,Fresh,"The animals have names; call it anthropomorphism if you like, but the cat families and their gripping adventures are all the more real to child viewers for that bit of familiarity."
1,Rotten,"It's hard to feel sympathy for such a miserable miscreant. Impossible, in fact."
1,Rotten,"Glazer provides hope that filmmakers eventually will step out from Tarantino's shadow, but they have to bring something new to the table."
0,Fresh,"Um filme que exige ser visto mais de uma vez, no mnimo para que possamos ter o prazer de rever atuaes to ricas em detalhes."
0,Fresh,Immersive is too simplistic a term for the astonishing work on display in Apollo 11.
1,Rotten,Any film that sets its vision of Spain in the era of Inquisition and Napoleon against Goya's needs to have something pretty special to offer; this one doesn't.
0,Fresh,"A compact, lurid tabloid item that blows the lid off mundane human insensitivity"

0,Fresh,An exquisitely made film in direct contrast to the ugliness of its subject matter
0,Fresh,"From its enigmatic opening scenes, which sends the viewers into a mysterious voyage a la Alice through the looking glass that ends up in a movie theater, Holy Motors (2012) is a celebration of the magic, imagination, and primal power of the movies."
0,Fresh,"Yes, it's unnecessary, but the joy of Sex and the City is that it is eminently entertaining and fun."
0,Fresh,"Combining skill and kitsch in equal measure, David Lean's overbloated epic (a disappointing follow-up to Lawrence of Arabia) offers guilty pleasure so long as you don't expect a faithful adaptation of Joe Pasternak's novel about the Russian Revolution."
0,Fresh,"This is big on action and small on originality. Gorgeous visuals aside, Epic is resolutely kiddie fare."
0,Fresh,With The Astronaut Farmer writer-director Michael Polish and his co-writer brother Mark continue a foray into American mythmaking that began with Northfork.
1,Rotten,"The movie tries too hard to be edgy, to work as a sweet romance, yet lacks the courage to push as hard as it needs to."
1,Rotten,"No, it's not good, and, no, I'm not recommending The Rite, but I can't bring myself to actually dislike a movie that includes Satan's mule."
0,Fresh,There's a sincerity here that packs a surprisingly emotional counterpoint to the action.
1,Rotten,"Chock-full of obnoxious dialogue, terrible acting, and oh-so-clever product placement."
0,Fresh,"All in all, it's a highly worthwhile, professionally accomplished project, but in its obsessive devotion to precise documentation, the film forgets to inspire."
0,Fresh,"A colorful, accomplished and involving crime drama with an evocative real-world backdrop; proof that some genres can translate into foreign markets and back again, with glossy ease."
1,Rotten,Some of us may remember Akiva Goldsman for his dual Razzie nominations (1997′s A Time to Kill and 1998′s Batman & Robin). This may be the year he wins.
0,Fresh,The film's most dramatic moment is one of its quietest: Dad sits down with Jake in the boy's bedroom...apologizing not so much for his handling of the situation as for the cruel complexities of life itself.
0,Fresh,"Effectively economical adaptation of Zola's Thrse Raquin results in a handsomely produced, highly satisfying psychological thriller."
0,Fresh,the last good batman movie thanks to MP
0,Fresh,"With so many stories in our collective cannon focusing on the male gaze, Sofia Coppola adeptly gives the gaze to the women."

0,Fresh,Underrated.

1,Rotten,"A provocative portrait of the great man less based on history than imagination and abounding in cinematic clich, but showcasing a virtuoso performance by Cox."
0,Fresh,"A sly, delirious homage to the writers, producers, techies and thespians who assemble with the common mission of telling a tale, and then, many months and meltdowns later, move on to the next project -- and paycheck."
1,Rotten,"I'd always take the live stage show if given a choice but if you're a fan of The Four Seasons, there's probably nothing I can say that'll stop you from seeing this."

0,Fresh,Although ambitious...Everyday People is a disappointing step backwards for the filmmaker.
0,Fresh,"Not be as suspenseful as it once was, because we've seen many shots of the body's interior and we no longer have the undercurrents of the Cold War that made life itself an edge-of-the-seat affair. But it's still a fun sci-fi excursion."
0,Fresh,"Visually spectacular with a first-rate cast, I, Frankenstein is hampered by a predictable script."
0,Fresh,Something Borrowed is a snappy rom com about intersecting desires among a group of twenty-something friends.
0,Fresh,"It's a wrenching two-+ hours, but it's also frequently funny. It's one of the great movies of 2019."
1,Rotten,The new Ben Affleck movie is less a movie than a chance for him to redeem himself for all those tabloid photos.
1,Rotten,"Uma pena que, ao se preocupar excessivamente com a idéia de gerar uma nova e lucrativa série, o filme se esqueça de si mesmo."
1,Rotten,I took my inner-5-year-old to see The Smurfs 2 and what happened? The little weasel sneaked out of the theater and went to watch something else.

0,Fresh,"Geraghty's wounded-pup appeal keeps the movie alive even as it heads for a dreary, even-more-implausible-than-the-setup third act. Writer-director Kyle Patrick Alvarez, though, usually finds the right tone and appears to have a promising future."

0,Fresh,"All in all, Night of the Living Dead is obviously just as marvellous as it's always been."
1,Rotten,"Despite its promising concept, the film is filled with lame pop-culture references and groan-worthy puns, and its technical aspects pale in comparison to those in the recent animated hits Kung Fu Panda and WALL*E."
1,Rotten,There's just not enough real heart to go along with the cutesiness.
0,Fresh,Those who can allow themselves to get enveloped by the movie are in for a genuine treat.
1,Rotten,"The moral appears to be: if you want to succeed as a screenwriter in Hollywood, never compromise yourself by writing anything that a real person might actually say."
1,Rotten,It is a film as long on tediously stylised fight scenes and portentous electro-folk music as it is short on emotional involvement.
0,Fresh,The film's Cassavetes-style aimlessness (think of it as a West Coast Husbands) gets a jolt when each of the guys pairs up with a willing woman.

1,Rotten,"If The Big Bounce is interesting in any respect at all, it's only in terms of the odds defied in it's winding up so dull."
0,Fresh,"Very nearly as good as the original, a funny and unexpectedly touching story of a middle-age man finding inspiration in ballroom dance."
1,Rotten,Mamet gets about halfway to great screwball comedy before the picture runs out of steam.
0,Fresh,"Greengrass has used his hand-held cameras to lend Phillips great senses of immediacy and place, making us privy to the thought processes and interpersonal conflicts among the pirates and the ship's captain and crew."
0,Fresh,"Not only did it give me a better-rounded perspective on the Rwandan tragedy, but it introduced me to a modern hero who stood against tyranny and oppression at the risk of losing all that was dear to him."
1,Rotten,"The ego, excess, and product synergy just don't feel all that exaggerated from pop music's real-life absurdities."
1,Rotten,Something akin to a Sunday afternoon TV movie of the week.
0,Fresh,Neither inferior nor superior to the Hollywood version.
0,Fresh,It gets its gravitas from the presence of Orson Welles' wise man. This was the legendary star's last acting gig.
1,Rotten,The creakiness of the plot mechanics and the light condescension I detect don't have me looking forward to the third Narnia movie.
0,Fresh,"It's clever, but manic. Watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit is like spending a weekend locked in a room with the looniest Looney Tunes characters."
1,Rotten,"...an overlong, uneven, occasionally unintentionally funny, weirdly toothless horror flick..."
0,Fresh,A boxing comedy with a potty mouth and warm heart.
1,Rotten,"If Mary Magdalene emerges less transcendent and spiritually satisfying than it ought to be, it's because of director Garth Davis' tendency to favour plodding biopic literalness over ascetic restraint."
0,Fresh,A horror film in which our darkest proclivities are the monster.
0,Fresh,"You may not leave the theater with a different view, but that's not the point. A good film is one that starts a conversation and provokes thought, and After Tiller is certainly one of those films."
1,Rotten,"Crass, stupid and ineptly made, this car-lot farce is so awful that it ought to qualify for the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program on grounds of polluting the atmosphere."
0,Fresh,"Until State of Play slips into its small cascade of improbabilities near its end, it proves a thoroughly engaging and professional enterprise."
1,Rotten,Aggressive in its insistence on being as awful as possible.
1,Rotten,A mostly ghastly spectacle
0,Fresh,... Sandler delivers the standout performance of what is an incredibly well-acted picture.
0,Fresh,"A marvelous, saucy romp."
0,Fresh,"The flick itself is quite funny... if you like Mr. Bean, that is."
0,Fresh,The film is never less than intelligent and never more than accomplished.
0,Fresh,"Newman's performance as Ben Quick, before the script blunts it, is as mean and keen as a cackle-edge scythe."
0,Fresh,...an eye opening account of human dignity.
1,Rotten,"I don't mean to imply that this film is any good or that it contains an ounce of genuine insight. But as a template for the big-baby genre, it's invaluable."
1,Rotten,A decent idea and cast are neglected in this ungainly Britcom with less of the com. A British actress might have been a better bet for this one.
1,Rotten,Boring and fundamentally silly.
1,Rotten,"Kids might enjoy some of Black's wacky antics, but adults will tire of them fast."
0,Fresh,"Miles beyond the great 2011 chapter. Ups the ante in storyline, character development and action, while giving a thrilling setup for future installments. It's the best of the Marvel/Avengers pantheon since The Avengers movie."
0,Fresh,"I'm sure I have never seen a film like this before. It is subtle, but makes its points clearly and simply. It is storytelling at its very best."
0,Fresh,"They're people you roll your eyes at in real life. But somehow, Miller makes them and their flaws appealing."
0,Fresh,"The result is a stunning mediation on loss and memory, with no shortage of anger to boost the narrative."
1,Rotten,Demonstrating that something darker lurks beneath the surface isn't as profound as the film seems to think
0,Fresh,"Deeply frightening, telling a story that could bore into your kids' nightmares if you're not careful."
1,Rotten,I can easily imagine Benigni's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial. Coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings.
0,Fresh,"All in all, action/adventure seekers who love to be entertained, surprised and captivated will enjoy Captain Marvel."
1,Rotten,"Stuffs male jackassery into a paper-thin piata of a contrived plot, then blindly bashes us over the head, again and again, with a stick marked 'SEE WHAT AN OLD MAN AND A YOUNG BOY CAN GET AWAY WITH!'"
0,Fresh,"Laced with enough laughs to make this work as both an action ride, and a comedy. Mirren and Malkovich steal the show."
0,Fresh,"Benefits greatly from the presence of Mexican horror maestro director Guillermo del Toro, delivering action, blood, gore and guts in crowd-pleasing fashion."
0,Fresh,An engaging romantic love drama that morphs into a deeper and richer consideration of the truly transformative power of love.
1,Rotten,"Tuned in to current politics, narrating the failure of isolationism, as the men imagine can lock themselves up apart from the world."
0,Fresh,"Unlike many filmmakers who try to stake out the gray area between mundane reality and sleazy surreality, Ruscio maintains a successful balance throughout and gracefully brings the two together in a delicately ambiguous final scene."
0,Fresh,Gretchen Moll is brilliant.
0,Fresh,"I love movies where survivors have to find supplies. You give me two hours of Will Smith alone gathering supplies, that's all I could ever hope for. I Am Legend gave me even more. It is the best survival movie ever made."
0,Fresh,"Some sketches are amusing, others are funny, and a rare few are altogether side-splitting."
0,Fresh,"Older kids may be less enthused by this mousy story, though parents, particularly Basil Rathbone fans, will marvel at the accuracy with which this sophisticated homage hits Holmes."
0,Fresh,"Gareth Huw Evans doesn't swipe plot points as much as organically build a taut, expertly choreographed heir to urban mayhem fantasies"
0,Fresh,"Although there is some gimmickry, this is one of the most straightforward versions of the ""Tempest"" ever filmed, making it edifying as well as -- when Taymor hits a groove -- dazzling."
0,Fresh,"The solid cast, including Eddie Marsan as a theatre impresario nicknamed Uncle, and Daniel Mays as Kildare's trusted lieutenant, helps keep the story afloat."
1,Rotten,"Snowden's story is well worth telling, but by forcing it to fit the template of a generic action-thriller it becomes predictable, rote and, worst of all, unreal."
1,Rotten,"Spacey furrows his brow a lot when he isn't making confused-hurt puppy-dog eyes at everyone, [but] he's really hard to feel any sympathy for when you just want to smack some sense into him."
1,Rotten,"It's an intriguing and well-acted, if gimmicky and repetitive, cinematic experiment that nevertheless feels emotionally detached."
0,Fresh,A very worthwhile drama and well worth seeing.
0,Fresh,"Básicamente un buen film de entretenimiento sobre un tema ""serio"" como el combate al terrorismo, armado de manera eficaz aunque superficial."
1,Rotten,"Only in Shakespeare land are you allowed to do the same story over and over again. With this version of Spider-Man, a lot of familiar territory leaves one bored and wanting more."
1,Rotten,"Hearing some of those old, beloved one-liners again made me smile, but they did not have the power to make me laugh anew."
1,Rotten,The latest installment in the seemingly endless Rocky franchise offers nothing new but still may appeal to fans of the genre.
1,Rotten,It preserves some of the form and language of White's original but fattens and sweetens his lean and pungent prose with songs by Richard and Robert Sherman.
1,Rotten,"When we have to endure the poor plotting, forgettable side stories, and thinly drawn themes, we're reminded why this series probably should've ended two films ago."
0,Fresh,"An unforgettable coming-of-age comedy that's sweet, witty, and brings back the joys of being young and full of life."
1,Rotten,"Slasher flicks have never been big on story, but the ""Saw"" franchise sets the art of screenwriting back to the stone age. Good horror movies scare you, this one just puts you in a bad mood."
0,Fresh,Bouquets to Rachel Ward whose adept and sensitive screenplay and direction make this adaptation an emotional journey that resonates acutely.
1,Rotten,"Statham gives a good account of himself as the no-nonsense Detective Brant, handy with his fists and ready with a wry one-liner, but an unoriginal plot and a general lack of excitement don't do justice to either him or the high-calibre supporting cast."
0,Fresh,"A combination of drama, tragedy, romance, some comedy, a side of gangster thriller. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Williams gets laughs from his character's slow implosion: even when things go well for Lance, the potential for humiliation is written all over his face."
0,Fresh,"a charming valentine to young love, cool music and New York City after dark."
0,Fresh,"While [...] imperfect in many ways, the whole proves to be far more than the sum of its parts."
1,Rotten,"Jumper never contends with its biggest liability: the fact that its main character is neither a lovable rascal nor a fascinatingly dark antihero, but just kind of a smug tool."
0,Fresh,"In its convincing portrayal of a situation where a rusty nail is as lethal as an unexploded bomb, and the few remaining inhabitants seem - much like the audience - more likely to die of stress than anything else, the movie rocks."
0,Fresh,"The real star of this show is director Lee Daniels. He's the one who conjures the film's eerie mix of kitchen-sink realism and gothic symbolism, its deft back-and-forth between the horrific and the sublime."
1,Rotten,"Slick and sycophantic, glossing over the U.S. government's deplorable actions and the unintended consequences of Snowden's disclosures."

0,Fresh,"""Glen Campbell: I'll be Me"" is a gift, to its celebrated subject, who gets a final keepsake, and to its audience, which gets a ticket to our shared past and an insight into our shared future."
1,Rotten,"An okay cast presents a plot with a few twists but the gruesome ones, especially for a PG-13 rated movie, are totally sadistic"
1,Rotten,"There's nothing going on beneath the artful surface, and the kid's dilemma generates yawns instead of heat."
0,Fresh,"I may be at a point with super-hero movies where I only enjoy the ones that ridicule the genre. Into the Spider-Verse has a lot of fun deflating, ""the canon."""
0,Fresh,"Onah and Lee may well be biting off way too many social problems; certainly far too many for one two-hour movie. But these are issues, especially black identity in the age of Trump, that deserve our attention."
1,Rotten,"If this new series is coming, they need to take some risks and stick to it...backtracking like this does no service to the genre."
0,Fresh,"[F]or those who followed the British period TV series which ended in 2015, there is plenty of nostalgia and fan service."
0,Fresh,"Surprise, surprise: Warm Bodies is not an abysmal Twilight-esque nightmare. It's sweet, at times perfectly droll, but ultimately very uneven."
0,Fresh,"It is an entertaining and acceptable film, but... at times gives the feeling that we are facing a succession of Hollywood patterns. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"The four leads are all capable stewards of their characters, each with their own sunniness and charm."
1,Rotten,"In the light of day, it's the kind of movie you'd go Coyote Ugly on in order to get away from."
0,Fresh,"Some fresh takes on midlife crises, celebrities in America, and the wild popularity of the social media."
1,Rotten,"Director Hiltzik is so focused on creating a twist ending that he forgets to design an actual conclusion, leaving behind a number of loose ends and unresolved plot points."
1,Rotten,"Holm assumes the audience requires ample evidence of Ove's goodness, and the film loses its footing in backstory melodrama."
0,Fresh,"In its stripped-down realism and blistering fixation on its main character's grappling with life and mortality, the film is kin to Roberto Rossellini's collaborations with Ingrid Bergman."
0,Fresh,"Blood Diamond is unapologetically political, but if you're going to do this kind of thing, this is the way to do it. The film works as a message movie, yet it's also terrific entertainment."
0,Fresh,[Lillian Gish's] virtuoso performance makes the heroine's growth from gullible innocence to bitter experience credible.
1,Rotten,Those Fockers. Did you see what I did right there? Made you think of a dirty word didn't I? That's the only 'joke' this third installment offers and they use it over and over again.
0,Fresh,"Talented actor Don Cheadle brings yet another angst-driven character to life in 'Traitor,' a looka t the question of whether the means ever justifies the end in killing."
0,Fresh,"Part conscience-searing history lesson, part shamelessly manipulative melodrama, Tate Taylor's adaptation sinks its teeth in early and never lets go ... Do I hear Oscar calling?"
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, this road movie calls on too many knee-jerk reactions: its shocking and funny scenes rely squarely on role reversals within a traditionally male genre."
1,Rotten,"None of the film's fine actors make us laugh while watching this misguided comedy, but Uma Thurman oozes so much glamour she holds our interest in all of her scenes."
0,Fresh,Bottle Shock is a feel good movie in the best possible way. You'll want to bottle this feeling and take it home with you.
1,Rotten,"The film aims for twee, but lands on torturous - It's narcissism blown up to a global scale, in the guise of a quirky voyage of self-discovery."
1,Rotten,'Hook' and 'Finding Neverland' at least seemed to know what Peter Pan was about. 'Pan' feels like Any Blockbuster remade as Peter Pan.
0,Fresh,"The last of the ""Ape"" sequels that's worth watching."
1,Rotten,"There's a great book there, but ""No Place on Earth"" director Janet Tobias chose to fill the gaps in the story with lengthy, indifferently acted ""re-creations"" that lead us to question how much of what we're seeing is true and how much is fictionalized."
1,Rotten,"without a pretext and knowledge of the classic author, much of the richness of this movie got lost"
1,Rotten,Being a fan of Adam Sandler movies is a lot like being a fan of the Baltimore Orioles.
0,Fresh,"Even Zac seemed to be outwitted by the power of Ted. A courtroom drama filled with charm and great acting, but something is missing in the story ."
0,Fresh,"...a sobering reminder of a deeply flawed, socially unbalanced legal system that to this day often turns its back on persons of color who can't afford the legal defense they truly deserve."
0,Fresh,Chockfull of nonstop inventiveness and unadulterated fun!
1,Rotten,A German thriller that isn't shy about ripping off The Silence of the Lambs.
0,Fresh,It's a rah-rah mix of patriotism and genuine suspense that manages to wring a few new wrinkles from a reliable subgenre of war movie.
0,Fresh,"Ricci's Carolyn is entrenched so in her small worldview, so surrounded by sameness, that as she opens her heart to Pumpkin it's entirely believable."
0,Fresh,A smart drama about a group of characters who want to believe that they're doing the right thing.
0,Fresh,"As wacky action-adventure movies go, this is a good film. But it's the type of work that more than a dozen Hollywood filmmakers could have turned out in less time than it took [director Quentin] Tarantino."
0,Fresh,"Ayoade's care with the movie's craft is loving and infectious - the feel of a hermetic, Stygian netherworld is perfectly achieved on the budget, and a grippingly nervy chamber score by Andrew Hewitt keeps it ticking along."
0,Fresh,"If viewers can stomach a lingering sense of familiarity, Archive offers a sturdy, slow-burn science fiction throwback."
1,Rotten,The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless.
0,Fresh,"One of the best films of our time, and our grandkids' time. ""Serpico"" is pure Pacino, powerful as hell."
1,Rotten,Who knew conversing with the dead was so much like a visit to the therapist?
0,Fresh,"It's thrilling, adventurous, and poignant in all the right ways. There may be more popular animated properties, but few have been as consistently good as this has been for nearly a decade."
0,Fresh,"""Praying with the violin"" is how an old friend describes the art of Itzhak Perlman in ""Itzhak,"" and by the time these words are said, the viewer is convinced."
1,Rotten,"Heigl and Wilson do their best to salvage a sinking ship, putting in fine performances that embrace ghoulishness director Anthony Burns eventually turns away from."
1,Rotten,"On the Line would like to be Serendipity for the Oxy-and-Skechers set, but it feels more like the worst movie Michael J. Fox never made."
1,Rotten,"The egregious lack of realistic grounding or common sense among its two protagonists diminishes the incentive for a rooting interest in whether Vic captures the perp, Stu gets the girl, or the car survives the night."
1,Rotten,"Although Raising Helen boasts a charming cast with a cute factor that's off the cinematic Richter scale, typical Hollywood predictability rears its ugly head too often."
0,Fresh,Boasts a real heart-stopper of a finale-an uncanny phosphor nightmare that depicts a marrow-deep fear shared by every kid who grew up in the video age.
1,Rotten,"Coogan and Winterbottom have pulled this trick off enough that one can't help but feel like the pair got a little greedy with the formula when making ""Greed."""
0,Fresh,"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum features the same cyclical franchise storytelling, but as executed thus far, further evolves action with newfound freshness and invigoration that ensures John Wick is Hollywood's most reliable action star."
1,Rotten,"It's not a horrible premise for a movie, but the execution is exceedingly trite and sloppy."
1,Rotten,"A stifling, tedious experience...Follow the lead of its title and cross this misfire off your list."
0,Fresh,"Answers never come easy in Evolution, which is key to its appeal."
1,Rotten,"I came away with the same trashy opinion of her I had before I saw this ""mock"" documentary."
1,Rotten,Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's Halloween is neither the blasphemous affront hardcore fans have feared nor the flat-out masterpiece one might have hoped for from one of modern horror's most distinctive talents.
0,Fresh,Gyllenhaal continues his streak of idiosyncratic roles ... and lends the film the strong emotions it fails to conjure with its feeble script.
1,Rotten,"Boasts sometimes photorealistic animation and some cool concepts (the heroic 'Leafmen' ride hummingbirds like horses), but it's grounded by the cliche aspects of everything else."
0,Fresh,"SPOCK: 'Logic dictates we include all the ingredients which have proved popular in our earlier films. Data indicates that one crucial element is what humans call 'tongue-in-cheek' humor; in-jokes about previous episodes, self-mocking references, etc.'"
1,Rotten,This film is a hogwhimpering disgrace for all concerned.
0,Fresh,"With Scorsese's intervention, I'd hoped Shine a Light would be innovative and extraordinary, but as a Stones fan I was thrilled to see a live show from these Rock Gods of nearly half a century that puts any band of young whippersnappers to shame."

0,Fresh,Even those of us who regard the Marvel aesthetic as a plague on world cinema can find much in Spider-Man: Homecoming to be charmed by.
1,Rotten,What's Your Number? Dumb question. And an even dumber movie.
1,Rotten,"Touches on the life of sullen and celebrated US poet Bishop, and her creative and emotional isolation in mid-20th century Brazil during the brutal military coup there. But while bypassing and isolating as well, the role of the CIA in orchestrating it."
0,Fresh,"Its dry humor, earthy performances and distinctive take on the clash between art and life help it earn every tear and cheer."
0,Fresh,"An original blast of a film. ""Searching"" heartily implies we instinctively know our dearest family members better than we give ourselves credit for, even when the evidence insists otherwise."
1,Rotten,Ratner's simplistic storytelling is too much surface and not enough soul. Too bad since his cast is so game. Enough to make Ridley Scott wince.
1,Rotten,"putting all the first-act plot holes aside, Dorm Daze is, well, still a really stupid film"
0,Fresh,"A stirring, committed portrait of black lives at a crossroads in the American South."
1,Rotten,"awash with dark moodiness as it tells a raggedy story that suffers from a failure of to find a narrative structure as strong or as compelling as the performance of his star, Charlize Theron"
1,Rotten,"If you'll settle for gold-plated pageants, for muscular episodes and for graphic inducements to wolf-whistling, then ""Samson and Delilah"" is for you."
0,Fresh,"It's a cliche to say, but you literally will not believe your eyes as you stare agape at what no human should ever be able to see."
1,Rotten,"Aside from appreciating the fine acting of Moss, Stuhlbarg, and Young, I found ""Shirley"" to be a great disappointment. That said, it did inspire me to reread ""The Lottery,"" which is something I can wholeheartedly recommend."
0,Fresh,"Despite the occasional cliché (the too-perfect social worker, most glaringly), Southpaw is action-specialist Antoine Fuqua's most solid work since 2001's Training Day."
0,Fresh,"It's one of the most gruelling and disturbing films you will ever see but, if you want the truth, essential."
0,Fresh,Collin and Miles's relationship also allows the movie to carefully but confidently address some of the thornier realities that abstracted political and social arguments often sidestep for convenience's sake.
0,Fresh,One of the supreme cinematic achievements of the last quarter-century.
0,Fresh,Moneyball is a restrained drama with moments of unconventional excitement.
1,Rotten,The number one killer is that it's two hours and 10 minutes long and the plot recycles itself over and over again.
1,Rotten,No one seems to recognize the irony of making a film about corporate rigging that is itself outrageously rigged.
0,Fresh,"A diferencia del anterior estudio de heroísmo de Eastwood (American Sniper), Sully: hazaña en el Hudson se siente como una celebración genuina."
1,Rotten,"[The] jokes...ain't built for repetition, nor is the film's malnourished narrative."
0,Fresh,"Happiness is a warm feature-length animated cartoon called The Peanuts Movie, a loving tribute to the beloved comic strip that graced the funny pages for half a century."
0,Fresh,Star Wars as a franchise is not perfect. But Rogue One gave us something different in its standalone approach. It reinforces the simple notion of hope and change and the true cost of conflict and war.
0,Fresh,"Tightly constructed sequel that takes the original in an unexpected direction while delivering the requisite amounts of shock and gore, though it lacks the first film's focus on character and is significantly less terrifying as a result."
0,Fresh,"While the movie's inspirations might be glam-Hollywood action fantasies, Night Watch fairly wallows in damp, post-Soviet decay."
1,Rotten,"I love musicals, but I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this curiosity."
0,Fresh,"Even those who might not understand the enigmatic figure at first will be fascinated, but for those who appreciated his daring, a deeply rewarding portrait awaits."
0,Fresh,"A movie can be unreasonably formulaic and still be reasonably diverting, and ""A Bad Moms Christmas"" is the proof."
0,Fresh,"As far as Christmas romance movies go, Feast of the Seven Fishes is quite watchable, funny in several spots and sweetly poignant in others."
0,Fresh,"It works as well as a comedy as it does a thriller. Not perfect for either genre, but thoroughly enjoyable."
0,Fresh,"The American South's ""peculiar institution"" has, it seems, become a fit topic for narrative cinema. And it only took a century."
1,Rotten,"Yet another awful, flag-waving, post-War on Terror guilt reassignment picture."
1,Rotten,A film of distinguished performances that rise above a coincidence-riddled and perfunctory screenplay -- without redeeming it.
1,Rotten,"There's something wrong with Hustle. A bad aftertaste, and not just the dry grit of Memphis dust, but something meaner. A feeling that Brewer's sensibility is way off."
1,Rotten,"Thanks to Duplass's 'regular guy' appeal and Wilde's ability to play the girl-next-door with the same aplomb as possessed siren, The Lazarus Effect proves believable enough to be entertaining but a little too bland to leave much of a scar."
1,Rotten,The narrative that unfolds in the wake of Spence's journey recalls Paris but walks too heavy for a character study to gel.
1,Rotten,(The film) has its charms but is more often than not overly talky and serious...A lighter touch on (writer-director Danny) Buday's part would have likely made the film more entertaining as well as more endearing.
0,Fresh,"Contained yet expansive, nostalgic yet new, Rogue One introduces striking heroes and villains and fills its two hours and 13 minutes with a narrative that fits snugly into canon."
0,Fresh,...the humor in no way minimizes the film's ability to frighten and unnerve us.
0,Fresh,"Slightly pretentious, but original enough to be a bit interesting, and buoyed by strong performances from Depp and Morton, The Libertine is a decent telling of a historical footnote, most interesting because of its strong feminist message."
0,Fresh,It's pretty clear from The Cabin in the Woods that co-writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard love horror movies almost as much as they are annoyed by them.
0,Fresh,"Plenty of cinematic subterfuge is needed to keep this high-speed heist act in the air, but it's a fun ride if you don't look where you have been or where you are headed."
0,Fresh,HBO's original film about the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings is a quietly powerful portrait of institutional dysfunction in the face of an uncomfortable truth.
0,Fresh,You should definitely watch it... with a bottle of wine.
1,Rotten,"''Oliver & Company'' is impoverished technically, and it is also impoverished emotionally."
1,Rotten,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse is pretty awful, still... Apocalypse, so this is the last one then right? End of everything and all that... *sigh*... right?"
0,Fresh,'Birds of Prey' is a fast and irreverent spit in the eye to the pomposity of the overblown superhero genre.
0,Fresh,The bottom line is that it delivers all the excitement and adventure it promises.
0,Fresh,"It's as if the filmmakers are too nervous about making a mistake, so consistently take the safe path, draining the movie of colour and leaving us sympathetic but uninspired."
0,Fresh,Nighthawks is a compelling movie with plenty of adrenaline-pumping chase sequences.
1,Rotten,"The world of the movie is so violent, drug addled, and unattractive that we were left somewhat aghast."
1,Rotten,It often undercuts its nobler goals by resorting to hammy dialogue and unnecessarily melodramatic contrivances.
0,Fresh,A powerful tale of a personal conflict that turns tragic when emotions spin out of control.
0,Fresh,"Hugely entertaining, sassy and great-looking."
0,Fresh,"Benazzo and Day offer a nice overview on such a colossal event, which gets surprisingly little attention from the Western media."

0,Fresh,A blockbuster with a heart and a brain.
0,Fresh,"It's not especially challenging. But it is several steps up from some faith-based fare, and it will doubtless appeal to its target audience."
1,Rotten,"The movie is devoid of laughs, thanks to James Bridges' characteristically humorless direction."
0,Fresh,"It crams in all of the best Bugs and Daffy Duck cartoons from the post-war period, + a dizzying 15-minute compilation of Roadrunner sketches."
1,Rotten,It would also be hard to imagine a less exciting movie.
1,Rotten,The film is neither a too-big-to-fail event film nor a relatively low-budget genre sleeper.
0,Fresh,"This movie proves that fans should wait until a movie is released before passing judgment. Based on the behind the scenes drama this should have been a disaster, instead the little movie that could Triumphs!"
1,Rotten,"What Lucas needs to wrap up this franchise properly is a return to the fundamentals: less overplotted hooey, more thick blue liquid."
0,Fresh,"Overstylized and burdened by its chaotic, quick-cut editing. But its performances save it."
0,Fresh,At its best -- and queasiest -- The Counterfeiters asks disturbing questions more commonly found in the survivor literature of Primo Levi or Bruno Bettelheim than at the movies.

0,Fresh,"Office Christmas Party veers into the ridiculous, but with a cast of likeable and quirky characters the wackiness works, without dazzling. It's even manages a hint of feel-good."
0,Fresh,"Looper has more heart than Brick and the 2008 con-man flick The Brothers Bloom. Both fine achievements, they could also be described as viscerally cerebral."
1,Rotten,"A sloppy, poorly executed mess of a film confusing horror with child endangerment."
1,Rotten,"A pleasant and engaging enough sit, but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole."
1,Rotten,"But there's a thin sheen of flop sweat on The Vampires Assistant, as if it's thinking its hoped-for sequels... it's like being on a first date and having the other party reach across the table ... and ask you if you want chicken or fish for the guests at"
0,Fresh,"Those attacking Al Gore as a misinformed prophet or political crybaby likely never watched the film. Holding court with genial wit and warmth, Gore emphasizes his slide content's morals and ethics over its politics and ends on practicality, not panic."

0,Fresh,"If 2001's Moulin Rouge proved that modern audiences would support a large-scale musical, then Chicago confirms the genre has got legs -- lots of legs, actually."
0,Fresh,"Quivering with too much CGI, an bizarrely staged opening sequence, and a lackluster ending, Vanishing ends up being ""just OK"", but that's good enough for me."
1,Rotten,The Birth Of a Nation stands out more for its subject controversy than for its production. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"This film fails not because it is conventional, but because it is lazy and dumb -- unworthy of its subject matter."
0,Fresh,"While The Gospel's faith-laced dialogue might annoy non-Christians, the plot mostly explores themes of a universal nature. Recommended to members of any faith for the stirring, onscreen performance of Grammy-winner Yolanda Adams."
0,Fresh,"Overall, a pleasant surprise."
1,Rotten,"The third and worst of Stieg Larsson's trilogy is poorly directed, under-energised and unthrilling."
1,Rotten,"Blokey whimsy can work, but when it's misfiring there's a high risk of being left down in the dumps."
0,Fresh,"A slick, surprising summer entertainment from a terrific director who's having a helluva time just keeping everyone laughing, and guessing."

0,Fresh,"Although not a yuletide classic, Four Christmases is better than most of the holiday-oriented slop put out in recent years."
0,Fresh,"Rihanna's performance is an encapsulation of the entire film. It has style, imagination and energy to burn. But disappoints when it comes to dialogue, pacing and plot."
1,Rotten,"Finally, a cast of high school students approved by AARP."
1,Rotten,Read the book instead.
1,Rotten,"The premise -- someone trying to inject meaning into a necessarily vacuous existence -- is depressing, but there are moments of vaguely uncomfortable hilarity. The whole endeavor, however, winds up feeling flat and a bit dull."
0,Fresh,If the trailer for The Change-Up looks bad -- and it does -- it's because Universal saved all the jokes for the actual movie.
0,Fresh,"The film feels unique and vibrant if only for the fact that it's the painfully rare DCAU title that doesn't revolve around Batman, Superman, or a Batman/Superman-led Justice League."
0,Fresh,"While it may fail to reach its loftier ambitions, Money Monster is a tightly controlled and highly entertaining thriller with a standout performance from Jack O'Connell at its centre."
0,Fresh,"A great story and great music, right down to the final credits."
0,Fresh,"Whether Carrey's fans will like it or not, the film is easily his best crafted piece of work to date."
0,Fresh,"A dark comedy that confirms Diablo Cody as a screenwriter of importance, eliminates the last shred of doubt that Jason Reitman is a major director and gives Charlize Theron her best showcase since ""Monster."""
0,Fresh,"The director's 100th feature, Blade of the Immortal shows Miike to have lost none of the madcap energy and wit that characterize his best work. And while this is not that, it's still got more style to burn than almost any recent Hollywood actioner."
0,Fresh,One of the saddest explorations of love and loss captured in one of the most underestimated films of the '80s.
0,Fresh,"This is a movie both efficient and vast, both ambitious and conventional, both funny and believable."

0,Fresh,"Evans  uma figura fascinante, e  justamente sua narrao em off, associada  tima edio, que transforma este documentrio em um cido depoimento sobre Hollywood."
1,Rotten,"For all its edge, What's Your Number? is rooted in stale convention, boxed in by unfair societal strictures and holds to the belief that good girls still need the affirmation of a man and marriage to be complete."
0,Fresh,"An edge-of-your-seat, adrenaline-fueled, high body-count splatterfest that remains riveting from start to finish despite dispensing with the idea of plot development once the premise has been set."
1,Rotten,"the story itself is uninteresting, and the songs are painfully undistinguished: They Might Be Giants' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed."
0,Fresh,It's the kind of film that really makes you think and turns you upside down.
1,Rotten,"Pretty but overwrought, Hounddog doesn't deserve its infamy, nor does it merit being seen or remembered."

1,Rotten,"It's like a music video, cretinously portenteous, in the worst possible taste."
0,Fresh,"Just like Springsteen's music, there's a lot of raw emotion underneath the grandiose packaging."
1,Rotten,It's far from stellar.
0,Fresh,Kid & Play made two half-decent movies. This is one of 'em.
1,Rotten,"This movie is wretched, condescending, and sad, like watching an elderly man spend more than 100 minutes tapping his arm for the youth vein -- which he never finds."
1,Rotten,It [the book] bored me to tears and sucked the life out of my summer vacation. The movie is much better and gets an above average rating only because it is days shorter.
0,Fresh,"Julianne Moore shows us that she is still in her prime, playing to every subtle nuance of the degenerative disease with precision and respect."
0,Fresh,"Director Jenkins handles this tricky material with tact and a nuanced touch -- there are laughs, but the circumstance is real enough to resonate with anyone who's experienced the confusion, guilt, and disorientation that such a circumstance imposes."
0,Fresh,"Directed by Sam Mendes, this movie might not be as flashy as his Oscar-winning American Beauty, but it's a smarter film, more mature and emotionally honest."
0,Fresh,"The whole of Chan Is Missing, impressively photographed in black and white by Michael Chin, funny and fast moving, crackles with the excitement of a new director tackling a new, exciting subject."
0,Fresh,"For those who love the majesty of the solar system, the thrill of space battles, and the adventure of finding secret passageways in old houses, this movie should be just the ticket."
1,Rotten,"It's strange how sour the results can be; Husbands and Wives takes the same kinds of dancing passions that looped through Hannah and her Sisters, and turns them into a crabby-go-round."
1,Rotten,The Bad Over Powers The Good
1,Rotten,You've seen it all before. You don't want to see it again. It will hurt your head and lay waste to your soul.
1,Rotten,"A generic, fitfully funny mainstream comedy that doesn't nearly get the best from its name-brand players but doesn't qualify as a desecration, either."
1,Rotten,It is hard to imagine what possible point there was in turning it into a movie. Nothing MOVES.
0,Fresh,Under-tens are unlikely to be the only ones wondering what's going on; the story is an over-brainstormed botch job.

0,Fresh,"The film is worthy, obviously, and it forces us to think about the prices paid by our unexpected heroes."
0,Fresh,"...a marvelous film to look at, with its strange, surrealistic sets, if not a film to engage one's intellect very strongly."
0,Fresh,American Made delivers so much as rambunctious entertainment that it's easy to miss the film's withering assessment of American foreign policy during the Reagan years.
0,Fresh,"""Lucky Them"" has that rare gift: It leaves its audiences warm and happy, as the best romantic comedies do."

0,Fresh,Safety Not Guaranteed casts an enchanting spell from its opening scene.
1,Rotten,"Fred Claus is not an entirely bad picture, but it is a decidedly bland one."
0,Fresh,"There is a freedom to his filmmaking; he's trying things, odd moods and unexpected edits and unconventional compositions. He likes to keep things popping, and you can't help but respond to the wit and playfulness of his style."
0,Fresh,"True, there are clichéd moments. And predictable moments. And the ending is pat and sentimental, and has it all ways, but her energy whizzes you past all that."
0,Fresh,"Impressive, sure, but ultimately stultifying."

0,Fresh,"Flawed, sure. But way too on-the-money, on-message and smart to ignore."
0,Fresh,"Assured, glossy and shot through with brittle desperation."
1,Rotten,"[The] script has the excruciating familiarity and predictability of a gal-pal tearjerker we've seen a hundred times already; all that's missing is to have Barrymore burst into a chorus of ""Wind Beneath My Wings."""
1,Rotten,"Not unlike the generation it's trying to represent, We Are Your Friends never really takes the time to consider what it would like to say."
0,Fresh,Only occasionally successful . . .
1,Rotten,Director Roos has way too many balls in the air here. The film is long and the multiple plots distracting.
0,Fresh,"...doesn't hold a candle to Spike Jonze's ""Her"" for insights into man's relationship with artificial intelligence. For all its stunning locations, brilliant design and seamless visual effects, the story begs the question 'Is that all there is?'"
0,Fresh,"Maybe it's Segel's sad navet, or the filmmakers' inventiveness and metaphorical dexterity, but even when the contrivance kicks in, it seems like Jeff might have the right idea."
0,Fresh,"Atomic Blonde is less a movie than a mood. But if you're in the mood for what it has on offer, you'll emerge one happy camper."
1,Rotten,All the candy-colored visuals and outsized performances in Underland can't make up for this sequel's thoroughly unimaginative story and cookie-cutter execution.
0,Fresh,"Funny, sad, conventional, unpredictable -- just like the real thing!"
1,Rotten,"The more this alleged romantic comedy begs you to adore it, the more you wish you could block its calls."
0,Fresh,There's plenty here to intrigue and eventually terrify thanks to a script that keeps us guessing about what really has unfolded above ground.
1,Rotten,It feels like a refugee from a 2005 straight-to-video bin.

1,Rotten,"Feminist fiasco, frivolously named 'Charlie's Gayngels' in the LGBTQ community."
0,Fresh,"What question do the filmmakers want people to ask when it's over: ""What happened?"" or ""What does it mean?"" Clever and accomplished as it is, The One I Love prompts too much of the former."

0,Fresh,"You'll see how a talented filmmaker sustains suspense with a small budget, few special effects and relatively little gore."
1,Rotten,"After a strongish start, the film doesn't so much sag as utterly collapse - each audience member will feel like someone who has flung himself into a hammock that isn't tied at either end."
0,Fresh,Another wacky and dark and visually dazzling film by the makers of Delicatessen.
1,Rotten,"Kriv Stenders' latest effort, Kill Me Three Times, is a lazy Tarantino film which uses a non-linear timeline to cover up a lacklustre story."
0,Fresh,"See it for [Ryan] Gosling and [Michelle] Williams, but be advised: if you take a date, you'll be sorry."
0,Fresh,Southern-fried vampire-noir romance action horror tragedy. I love this movie.
0,Fresh,Wonderful family entertainment.
0,Fresh,"It all makes for a rather busy sequel (having four writers will do that to a plot), but kudos to returning (and perfectly named) director Marc Webb, who keeps the plot from getting stuck in its own gluey traps."
1,Rotten,"The suspenseful set-up never pays off, but Rampling continues the impressive collaboration with Ozon that began with Under the Sand in 2000."

0,Fresh,"Ellen Page and Allison Janney turn in compelling performances as two very different but equally troubled women, but Tallulah's story doesn't do justice to its cast."
0,Fresh,"A necessarily absurd, slightly surreal and always lucid comdey that is a reflection of the current crisis. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,The film is plainly a meaningful project for the openly gay Emmerich and Baitz. Stonewall carries tremendous symbolic weight for millions the world over. So why this white-bread generica?
0,Fresh,This well-acted dramedy is a ploddingly earnest look at addiction and recovery.
0,Fresh,"Overall, Focus starts well, looks good with [Will] Smith and [Margot] Robbie as engaging as ever but it ultimately (and ironically) loses focus."
0,Fresh,"As with all anthologies you take some risks, but ""The Thing in the Woods"" and ""This Way to Egress"" make Nightmare Cinema worth checking out."
0,Fresh,A work of moving ideological commitment as well as beautifully detailed orchestration.
1,Rotten,It's no great surprise that Christina Aguilera can sing. But I'm sorry to report that her breakout movie is similarly revelation free.
0,Fresh,... a deeply cynical film that makes no pretense about the status of women in society.
0,Fresh,It's way more fun rooting for Rebel than it is pretending to care whether Katherine Heigl will get the guy.
0,Fresh,"Goofy, bawdy, and full of slapstick physicality ""Step Brothers"" takes advantage of the natural comic chemistry between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly to generate a coming of age comedy that's funnier than any of Will Ferrell's recent outings."
0,Fresh,"Live by Night is not an out-and-out gangster film. If you don't go in expecting the same, you'll enjoy watching it."
1,Rotten,Artful restraint in presentation can't counterbalance the lunacy of Along Came a Spider's content.
1,Rotten,So unfunny that I got up and left before it was over...pure cinematic torture.
1,Rotten,"Without a single creative element. Put simply, it's one of the worst films of the year."
0,Fresh,"Shocking, provocative and laugh-out-loud funny."
1,Rotten,"What a drag it is, this journey from planned matrimony with the wrong girl, to till-death-do-us part with the right one."
1,Rotten,Has a similar problem to its protagonist: It just sort of sits there.
0,Fresh,The fanciful flashbacks which are colorful and storybook-like add some magic to the mix.
0,Fresh,"It's as self-referential as any of the exuberant director's duds, but it's refreshingly self-deprecating too."

0,Fresh,It is a truly for-all-ages movie that is a joy to behold.
0,Fresh,"Bridesmaids is, in equal parts, bawdy and authentic, all the way through."
0,Fresh,"Dolomite Is My Name is a bittersweet, filthy-mouthed comedy that also sneakily educates its audience in the Black experience."
1,Rotten,"It would seem cynical - the perfect Sundance movie, at which festival it premiered - if it wasn't also nakedly earnest. It's almost likable despite trying hard to be so, and despite trying so hard in general."
0,Fresh,Ready Player One is popcorn entertainment that everyone can enjoy.
0,Fresh,"On top of the visuals and action, it is also laugh-out-loud funny, thanks no doubt to the Lord-Miller influence."
0,Fresh,It's Ford and Patriot Games that made Jack Ryan a top-notch action hero and not just a capable CIA nerd.
1,Rotten,"This 1987 bonanza of schlock features no less than four erstwhile Playmates of the Month, acting just as well as you'd expect."
0,Fresh,"Denial spends its first 20 minutes labouring under a rather clunky, wordy screenplay... But it completely changes gear after her legal team decides to visit Auschwitz and suddenly you realise what's at stake."
1,Rotten,"""Undisputed"" could have been compelling, but it ultimately plays out as a standard prison action movie."
0,Fresh,"Spanish director Pedro Almodovar adapts three stories by Nobel Prize-winning writer Alice Munro; though his sensibilities are quite different from her style, the result is surprisingly satisfying."
0,Fresh,"This pitch-perfect genre throwback would be right at home among the creaky and weird supernatural thrillers of the 70's and 80's. (And yes, I mean that as a compliment.)"
0,Fresh,It's certainly better than all the bad romantic comedies we've had recently.
0,Fresh,"Hamilton does a great job not only educating us about Kenny's impact on basketball and his career, but also gives us a window into what kind of man he was."

0,Fresh,"Revealing, moving and entirely individual."

1,Rotten,"In ""Snatched,"" Schumer is indulged all of her worst tendencies."
0,Fresh,"A lot of horror movies use sex, or talk about sex, or even talk about how other horror movies use sex, but very few get to the root of what's actually scary about it."
1,Rotten,"A squall of improbabilities leads to a laughable late revelation, yet somehow the film keeps a clammy grip."
0,Fresh,"With the exception of the first Taken film (which, let's face it, should have been the only Taken film) this taut little Liam Neeson actioner could just be the best shoot'em upper he's done so far."

1,Rotten,Nauseating claptrap that allows a war criminal to waste 103 minutes of our time and over $10 of our hard-earned money in self-justification. Errol Morris should be ashamed of himself.

1,Rotten,"Inventive mess, filled with pock marks."
1,Rotten,"""Dad's Army,"" while perfectly pleasant, isn't very funny, fighting to find something grand to do with its WWII setting and cast of quirky characters. Parker isn't asleep here, but he isn't inventive either."
0,Fresh,"Extraordinarily suspenseful, extremely well-told and effortless in its complex tonal balance, Argo is a captivating and thoughtful true-life drama that boasts a story so astonishing, it could only be told in the movies."
1,Rotten,"It's the lamest idea for a romantic comedy in recent memory, as well as one of the sorriest star vehicles in ages."
1,Rotten,"Grandparents of today don't need the Great Depression stories to shock the youngsters. You heard me right, son. Eddie Murphy was once funny."
1,Rotten,"An ambitious animated film that at least attempts to aim for something different, but is impaired by its hackneyed plot."

1,Rotten,This is just disappointingly average.
1,Rotten,"Besides its hollow assertions, Sorry, Haters barely makes any sense."
0,Fresh,A surprising reassessment of troubled times.
1,Rotten,"Once those gags run out, however, the film slowly drags itself back on track, finding just enough traction in a handful of earnest moments -- all involving Richard Dreyfuss -- to help audiences forget how awful it had been at the start."
1,Rotten,"The movie that most nearly approximates a video game: lots of action, no plot, eye-catching computer effects and a dollop of violence."
1,Rotten,This intentionally superficial character and premise have been stretched out much further than they were ever meant to be stretched.
0,Fresh,"The cast turns utter naturalism into a raging zoo of survivalism, with brilliant little scenes scattered like spilled cereal throughout the screenplay."

1,Rotten,"Of course there is epic action to savour and surprises and spoilers to spill, but given the long, long build-up, some of the saga's big revelations and developments might be a little unsatisfying on reflection."
1,Rotten,A far-fetched conspiracy story that depicts the growing and pervasive role of technology in our lives.
0,Fresh,"As a showcase for a new scifi universe, there's rarely been better. It's just the most important stuff-character, emotion, plot-is overshadowed by that universe. That's what keeps Valerian from being great... but damned if it isn't a fun watch."

1,Rotten,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's latest sprawling, dispersed art-film blockbuster prompts a question: Does he just not know how to tell a story?"
0,Fresh,Combining Jackie Chan fights with Renny Harlin action seems like it opens a new world for both filmmakers.
1,Rotten,"While the actors desperately try to make something out of nothing, it's so terribly predictable and silly that audiences are more likely to have an occasional quiet chuckle than a scream - perhaps a more honest response is repeated yawning."

0,Fresh,A truly eye-opening experience.
0,Fresh,"You don't reach the level of stardom Ronstadt did without a white-hot fire of blind ambition, and although the film paints a portrait of an artist hell-bent on success, it's also clear she was also forever doubtful of her own abilities."
0,Fresh,"Melodramatic, yes, but this powerful, disturbing film is based on a real event in mid-Eighties Iran, which makes it easier -- or perhaps harder -- to bear."
0,Fresh,"Every new Star Wars movie since Disney bought Lucasfilm has been heralded as the first worthy successor to the Original Trilogy, but with The Last Jedi it's finally true."
1,Rotten,"Snyder's made something authentically confused and moderately offensive, apparently eager to place this dodgy film at the feet of young girls in search of heroes -- his own glossy brand of marketable rebellion."
0,Fresh,"It's nowhere near as blackly funny as it wants to be, but Thomas Haden Church is strangely compelling as a man befuddled by the vagaries of fate."
0,Fresh,"If the goals were a little more clear, the film could've been better...they could've played with the audiences' expectations much more, but this is an enjoyable horror movie, almost a slasher film."
0,Fresh,"It successfully combines action with wit, social commentary and comedy."
0,Fresh,"Not only does it capture the essence of the two outsize icons of film and scandal, it also brings them in for a humanizing close-up."
1,Rotten,Feels curiously flat and seems much too artificial.
1,Rotten,How do the stars of Blood Diamond make so many improbable escapes from hails of bullets? You'd think the movie ought to be called Near-Death Experience.
0,Fresh,"Though the characters and plot are all paint-by-numbers, Summer Storm is still a fairly charming look at what it's like for a typical teen jock to admit he's not so typical, after all."
1,Rotten,Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film.
1,Rotten,Another solid performance by Zac Efron is flattened by bombastic filmmaking.
0,Fresh,Far and away the best Zorro ever!
1,Rotten,The interaction between the leads is about as enticing as watching paint dry!
0,Fresh,"If you're interested in intellectual abstraction, you might find Haneke's games intriguing. Just be warned: When the movie ends, you'll definitely feel like you've been played."
1,Rotten,"If the name Nicholas Sparks was within fifty feet of it, it would be laughed out of the theater sight nearly unseen."
0,Fresh,Makes up for its gaps in logic with its breezy tone and its technological razzledazzle.
1,Rotten,"It will hopefully play better on cable, as the screenplay is TV-lite."
1,Rotten,"For those of us who love Cinema Paradiso, the news that its Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore and his musical soulmate Ennio Morricone were getting back together to do another coming-of-age film, Malena, gave us tantalizing hope. Malena fa"
1,Rotten,"Like a bad high school memory, no one wants You Again coming back to haunt them in the future."
0,Fresh,"The deepest mystery of Phantom Thread, and the strongest source of its suspense, is the question of what these two people might understand about each other, and what emotional bargain they might strike."
0,Fresh,"Whether the movie leaves you confused or angry, you will be stimulated to long discussion afterward. How often does that happen these days?"
0,Fresh,"As sports movies go, Gunnin' never feels the slightest bit hokey, and serves up SportsCenter-worthy clips in high style, along with the unmistakable feel of real life."
1,Rotten,"Tonally, American Reunion is closer to Hall Pass or The Dilemma than its own ancestors."
0,Fresh,"It's a consistently entertaining action movie with some solid performances and special effects, and unlike the last two movies, it doesn't do any damage to the franchise."
0,Fresh,Wilson and Hudson's chemistry is spectacular.
0,Fresh,"Just about every monster movie convention gets tweaked here and there, but it never feels like Shadows is forcing the issue to tick off another box."
1,Rotten,"All of this happens like dreamwalking, as if the characters in this movie knew they were doomed to follow the scenario laid down in the first one."
0,Fresh,Weerasethakul's sixth feature is a typically slowburning experience of art cinema that doesn't feature a single spoken word until eight minutes in and is as equally enchanting as it is infuriating.
1,Rotten,"Lopez wades through many nonsensical, pompous, gradually annoying dream-logic scenes."
0,Fresh,"Gerard Barrett has crafted a clear-eyed look at alcoholism, thwarted hopes and the ruts in which we get stuck.With its unexplained title, downbeat subject matter and deliberate pacing, it's not exactly Friday night fodder but it's absorbing all the same."
0,Fresh,"Tender, well-acted teen drama is true to classic Blume book."
0,Fresh,The LEGO Batman Movie seems like an easy cash-in on the success of The LEGO Movie but a true love for the source material and a sharp sense of humor has made this one of the best animated movies of the year.
0,Fresh,"A visually gorgeous, minimalist survival Western filled with weirdos, danger, and surprisingly mature themes."
0,Fresh,"What the film aims to show -- and does well ... is that McGovern's grassroots, anti-establishment tactics and ultimate victory at the Democratic convention was, and remains, an example of what U.S. politics strive, and generally fail, to achieve."
0,Fresh,"It is a good option for those who want to go to the movies, buy some popcorn and hang out without complications. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,A riveting masterpiece.
0,Fresh,"Despite a bunch of cold characters and a deeply contrived plot, this film is so infused with hot topicality that we are held in its grip all the way through."
0,Fresh,"Regardless of your political bent, you've gotta admit that Michael Moore is confronting critical issues that are all too oft-overlooked by the mass media."
1,Rotten,"Occasionally it veers into the ""so bad it's good"" category, but that doesn't change the fact it's very, very bad."
1,Rotten,"Manipulative and self-defeating, Crash resembles race-baiting PT Anderson fare or if Altman got stuck in the mid-80's."
1,Rotten,Troubling for all the wrong reasons.
0,Fresh,"Ragged around the edges and haphazardly hilarious though it may be, ""Top Five"" ultimately satisfies as an often raunchy ramble about celebrity, sobriety, selling out and sex, courtesy of the immensely talented but too-often subpar movie star Chris Rock."
0,Fresh,"Space Jam [whisks] Michael Jordan to Toontown for a make-or-break game with Bugs Bunny and the other Looney Tunes. Exuberantly mixing live action and animation, it's a high-energy dream teaming."
0,Fresh,"hough recycled, the story is well plotted and paced, and the old hands in the cast elevate the familiar material."
0,Fresh,Big ups to the seemingly selfless Winslet for throwing down without throwing her integrity away.
0,Fresh,"Like any good prosecutor, Tchin gives us enough information to render a verdict without bullying us into agreement. His gift to his viewers is the space to think for ourselves."
1,Rotten,...a relatively decent premise that's employed to progressively unwatchable effect by Hopkins...
1,Rotten,"... with a few quiet, moving scenes and a lovely ending, the film betrays an artist's touch, no matter how hard Kitano tries to make it look easy."
0,Fresh,"Plot aside, the movie belongs to 86-year-old Chin whose portrayal of a chainsmoking grandma is not to be missed."
0,Fresh,"A wicked little horror film in which nearly all of the violence takes place in your head, ""In Fear"" expertly builds terror out of not much more than two people driving around in a car."
1,Rotten,"Acorn-addict Scrat was always the star of this show -- why give him only a measly 10% stage-time in the snore-fest, 'Ice Age: Collision Course?' Kids will enjoy it nevertheless."
0,Fresh,We're offered the precious illusion that we're close enough with four pillars of English theatre that they're chatting to us about their memories and feelings; that we get to see them as people and as friends.
1,Rotten,"A fairly flat treatment of over-familiar plot elements, and fatally low on the key psycho-thriller elements of suspense, surprise and dread."
0,Fresh,"Trainwreck is worth seeing and worth talking about, but it's too managed and well-conducted; hopefully, next time, Schumer will really go off the rails and show us something truly worth looking for in the wreckage."
1,Rotten,"The trouble with Shia? He's no Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart, or Cary Grant. And as for Caruso, well, Brian De Palma can rest easy."
0,Fresh,"Fun but deeply, ridiculously silly."
0,Fresh,"Nathalie's brought to life by Huppert's subtly complex turn and Hansen-Løve's fluid, unfussy direction."
1,Rotten,My Blueberry Nights plays much like a dream; different vignettes fade into each other ... [but] nothing ever quite adds up.
0,Fresh,"There were reports that Duvall initially turned down this script, only to reconsider because he wanted to work with Downey. Good call."
1,Rotten,The Astronaut Farmer just drifts off into space.
0,Fresh,"Despite the trailer's first impressions, Inglourious Basterds is much more than Brad Pitt with a funny accent and a few Hitler-stache cameos."
0,Fresh,"Impassioned and brave, Free State Of Jones is a towering piece of leftist American cinema..."
0,Fresh,"Basically a glamorized DVD extra, but it entertains."
1,Rotten,Ziman pretends to be empowering his young heroine by putting a gun in her hand and tough words in her mouth. But there's something deeply discomforting about his camera's fetishistic leering.
1,Rotten,"Jack Black isn't an actor, he's a clown - and a one-schitck clown at that."
0,Fresh,"What Somers Town lacks in story arc, it makes up for in charm, as Meadows and company create an endearing and thoroughly enjoyable portrait of a young British bromance."
0,Fresh,It's hard to resist the movie's wrenching sense of intimacy.
0,Fresh,"While Keaton is a tour-de-force, Fight Club star Ed Norton is similarly rejuvenated as co-star Mike."
1,Rotten,"#Horror has plenty to say about cyberbullying, but it gets lost in frantic editing and bitchy stereotypes along the way."
1,Rotten,"This version of Red Dawn is so basic, so primal, that, instead of speaking to a post-modern movie audience, it merely grunts."
1,Rotten,"As Agatha might observe, it's all too, too yawn-making. Who are these dreadful people and why on earth must we watch them learning their little moral lessons?"
0,Fresh,Tilda Swinton gets metrosexual in Sally Potter's surreal and unique costume drama.
0,Fresh,"It's a fabulously entertaining view from inside a political campaign, giving us a firsthand experience of all the weird, Good Wife-style maneuvering that takes place."
0,Fresh,"Scream 2, like its predecessor, is a genre-crossing film. It is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery. The mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time."
0,Fresh,Trashily enjoyable thriller that puts its low budget to impressive use and scrapes a pass thanks to strong performances and some bone-crunching action scenes...
1,Rotten,"The nastiest and silliest of Larry the Cable Guide big-screen vehicles, Witless Protection, the formulaic road flick, is Witless Comedy par excellence."
1,Rotten,Some stylish touches are undone by overwrought genre tropes and an abundance of supernatural nonsense.
0,Fresh,"The Second Best Exotic Hotel barely skates by on the strength of its older cast members, which of course is ""the reason for the season"" anyway."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, Across the Universe never transcends the fundamental problems inherent in the concept."
0,Fresh,"Streep's performance of a dismissive line such as ""People don't think anymore, they feel,"" will have even the most dyed-in-the-wool liberal questioning core beliefs."
0,Fresh,"It may not be one of the best Star Wars movies, but viewed as a sci-fi summer blockbuster, it's a blast."
0,Fresh,As a romance it's perfect -- mostly because the two leads have such incredible chemistry -- and as a musical it works even for those who don't love musicals.
0,Fresh,"Damon is great. His comic timing as Mark Whitacre, a biochemist turned inept corporate whistleblower, transforms what should have been a dull film into an entertaining one."

0,Fresh,"The Pretenders is clever and cleverly performed, often visually alluring, observant, stylish and shallow."
1,Rotten,The movie works when it's Schumer and Hawn's show...
1,Rotten,Fun Size is the Nickelodeon equivalent of a Hallmark card for Halloween. Even the target audience will be asking their parents when it's polite to dispose of it after the holiday.
1,Rotten,"It's complicated. Oh wait, no it's not. This film is a classic example of rich people's problems."
0,Fresh,"Yes, this is evolution in the right direction, but now it's time to take that energy and give us a final chapter that will move and inspire as well as dazzle."

0,Fresh,"Although it's not one of the studio's best films, it's very fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"Blake Lively brings her snub-nosed energy and director Reed Morano brings her visual hallmarks of harried headspace. But whatever groove this initially intriguing revenge thriller finds collapses into a glum, generic dig-two-graves backbeat."
1,Rotten,"It's an odd little trip, but if it weren't, one would have to ask, ""Well what's all this, then?"""
0,Fresh,"Following on from the Freudian gothic of Coraline and the junkyard socialism of The Boxtrolls, Missing Link conjures a universe of faux-Victoriana, frontier America and Nepalese peaks"
1,Rotten,"Wayne gives it what he can, and so does Hepburn, but there's just too much going against them."
0,Fresh,'South Park' took a bite out of social justice warriors last year. Eli Roth's The Green Inferno embraced that spirit ... literally.

0,Fresh,"""Delivery Man"" offers a kinder, gentler Vince Vaughn in a pleasantly ramshackle comedy several rungs below his usual fare in both budget and high-concept assault tactics."
0,Fresh,It is a tremendous testimony to Gosling that we feel deeply for Dean.
1,Rotten,"To have your heart warmed as much as the film clearly wants to do, best to steel yourself for its straight-ahead plot and the irony that, in a movie obsessed with music, so many of its secondary characters are one-note."
0,Fresh,"Platoon remains one of the best war films ever made and, quite arguably, the best ever about the war in Vietnam."
1,Rotten,"The best it seems to be aiming for is to be unnecessarily gross, not scary in any way."

1,Rotten,Murder on the Bore-ient Express.
0,Fresh,Brilliantly stylized crime thriller.
1,Rotten,"Pride and Glory is a bleak, boring and hopelessly familiar corrupt cop story that simply does not work despite the determined, top-of-their-game efforts of O'Connor and Norton, not to mention Colin Farrell, Jon Voight and others."
0,Fresh,"Camp, overtly sexual cinema that owns its far-fetched nature and runs with it in the most unashamed fashion"
1,Rotten,it's time Ferrell gives these sports comedies a little time on the bench before his big-screen career fouls out.
0,Fresh,"The film has been superbly cast down to its smallest roles, and the talent and energy of the performers give it a zing that, indeed, makes much of it one big party."
1,Rotten,"The movie's ponderous re-enactment of history has the unfortunate effect of putting good actors in thankless roles, often under odd-looking prosthetics."
0,Fresh,"A personal, playful, and rich piece of auteur cinema disguised as a breezy popcorn movie. Pitt and DiCaprio are hilarious and hypnotic. Tarantino, unchained, is glorious. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"Glass starts strongly and fizzles, a dramatic droop which is initially camouflaged by the escalating grandiosity of visual rhetoric, something febrile and high-concept that is visionary in everything except actually having vision."
1,Rotten,This is a plea for self-described indie filmmakers to stop utilizing hyper-polished technique to talk about human misery.
1,Rotten,So contrived and tidy that it's not remotely believable.
1,Rotten,"Why, one wonders, didn't Lucas persuade his friend Steven Spielberg to take on this subject and treat it with the authority and respect he brought to Band of Brothers?"
1,Rotten,A poorly-done documentary that manages to make the phenomenon of swinging boring.
1,Rotten,"I had high hopes for ""Noelle.""Oh, well."
0,Fresh,"Fences may be a cautionary story about the effects of racism, but it is also a cunning, layered and consistently entertaining drama."
0,Fresh,"Sweet, silly, charming. A true story about an unlikely canine-assisted project to protect endangered birds, goofily fictionalized to engage kids."
1,Rotten,"Though its heart is in the right place, everything gets tangled up in the film's lunacy."
0,Fresh,Funny and touching.
0,Fresh,"A slight but infectious British comedy, Son of Rambow charms in spite of a slim plot and sketchy character development. The first ninety minutes may not be, but the last five are just about perfect."
1,Rotten,"Their love story has a mellow ease -- as neither of them has much of a personality, we're just watching two swell people decide to bone"
0,Fresh,"The Rosses create something akin to the parable of the Ship of Theseus for documentary: if one takes a documentary and replaces each element with a piece of fiction, is it still a documentary?"
0,Fresh,"If nothing else, the movie will be worth it if it finally makes a star of Deutch; she's overdue. J.L."
0,Fresh,"It's exactly as good as you figured it would be, taking few risks and coasting along its expected fast track to formidable drama."
0,Fresh,Delightful comedy with a subtle script and charming performances from its three leads.
0,Fresh,Somewhere inside this very mainstream Hollywood confection is a surprisingly subversive little bit of deconstruction. This is a movie about an un-makeover.
0,Fresh,"The perfect movie to premiere on Netflix, not quite distinguished enough to warrant a trip to the multiplex but ideal couch company on a rainy afternoon. Such modest virtues should not be underestimated."
1,Rotten,The movie is a bit of a crock - a stacked-deck family drama that's all bits and pieces stuck together out of a screenwriter's handbook.
0,Fresh,"Don't mistake this simpleton hero, or the movie's own simplicity, for a lack of smarts. Mr. Bean's Holiday is quite savvy about filmmaking, landing a few blows for satire."
0,Fresh,A glorious experience that transcends its simple dramatic premise. You would have to be fairly heartless not to be moved by it.
0,Fresh,The result is a happy blend of smart-aleck humor and wacky adventure.
1,Rotten,"It doesn't surprise me that this film sat for two years in storage before released, as the final version appeared clunky."
0,Fresh,"Seizing the role, and the screen, Jordan Gelber actually makes us care what happens to his surly, thoroughly unlikable character."
1,Rotten,"The experiment isn't more than a slice of life, but at least it's a generous one."
0,Fresh,"Pulled off with a fine cast and a taut storytelling sensibility from director George P. Cosmatos, the film is worth a revisit or a first-time look, whichever the case may be."
1,Rotten,Why remake a crappy movie five years later if it's only going to be marginally less crappy?
0,Fresh,Mars Attacks! may be the first sci-fi disaster movie that's also an impish black-comedy prank.

0,Fresh,An excellent film -- entertaining and informative and sometimes stunning in its display of the personal demons shared by these two geniuses.
0,Fresh,"Refuses to be shrugged off, ignored or overlooked."
1,Rotten,Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse.

0,Fresh,...one of the most awesomely entertaining movies of the year!
0,Fresh,Dances with Wolves is as genuine an artistic triumph as they come; a spellbinding American classic that tastes the tears of a country in the midst of all its incomparable beauty.
0,Fresh,"In ""Robert The Bruce,"" which is directed by Richard Gray and written by Eric Belgau and Angus Macfadyen, the story being told is less about myth and more about reality."
0,Fresh,Chronicle turns out to be--surprise!--a morality tale of good versus evil in the guise of a supernatural thriller: a phony faux doc.
0,Fresh,"It's stripped of narration, talking heads, and anything else that might threaten to slow it down."
0,Fresh,Cloverfield is visceral attack that it leaves the viewer reeling for details that flew by like so many bricks raining off broken buildings.
0,Fresh,"There are many indicators of star power. Not the least of them is unforgettability. On screen, no less than in the laboratory, Eric Kandel has star power."
0,Fresh,"Here's the thing about Won't You Be My Neighbor? You will cry. No matter who you are, you will tear up."
0,Fresh,"While fairly predictable and unoriginal, it is nevertheless entertaining."
0,Fresh,"The film moved at a clip, never bored me, offered an 'interesting' enough story-line for me to follow, and again, slam-dunked about half a dozen fun action sequences around the great McLane."
0,Fresh,"Chazelle's story could have been drowned in technical details, but as he did with musical terminology in Whiplash (""Not quite my tempo""), he reveals just enough for things to move forward."
0,Fresh,"Yes, it's not always plausible and unapologetically by the numbers, but when the numbers are polished to such a high sheen, it would be next door to treason to complain."
1,Rotten,...a tedious and thoroughly puerile ordeal.
0,Fresh,Fuller's low-budgeted masterpiece screams for more recognition.
0,Fresh,"...A slight film, sometimes droll, sometimes whimsical, and usually sharp."
0,Fresh,"Despite the beautiful aesthetics and the gloomy, visionary ambitions, ""Annihilation"" feels empty inside"
1,Rotten,"For all the talent on display in writing and acting, FENCES never quite transcends its source: handicapped by its reluctance to stray too far from its reassuringly successful story and cast. FENCES finds itself sitting on one on of its own making."
0,Fresh,"One of the best movies of the year so far that has you rooting for a dying circus, true love and one guy who just needs a second chance."
0,Fresh,...a decent (yet flawed) genre exercise.
1,Rotten,"Doesn't stick around for long, but still manages to overstay its welcome."
0,Fresh,"A caustic, surreal character study about what it means to be a parent, folded into a low-budget, naturalistic, urban documentary with jittery camera-work."
0,Fresh,"It's all a pretty obvious metaphor for the icy plunge that the Icelandic economy took recently, but is none the worse for it."
0,Fresh,"As Adam pursues his doppelganger across a Toronto of sleek, soulless high-rises, director Denis Villeneuve throws in puzzlingly surreal touches ... What on earth - or, more likely, the subconscious - is going on?"

1,Rotten,The video game perspective ends up being highly distracting in this movie. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"The satirical message is that the moral defenders of impressionable American youth would literally rather see violent death than obscenity, but Parker and Stone end up delivering both in overabundant quantities to prove their point."
0,Fresh,[An] ethereal slice of life in the San Fernando Valley ...
1,Rotten,Beautifully shot but more than a little sterile.
0,Fresh,"Shyamalan has done it again. He's taken a well-used genre, the alien invasion, and given it a spin that focuses on the human psyche rather than the surrounding events."

0,Fresh,Puts the psychological back into psychological thriller.
1,Rotten,"While the latest Netflix-produced rom-com struggles to decide what it wants to be, it seems clear from the outside - this should have been a TV series instead."

0,Fresh,"Scoop is no more than a beguiling trifle. But in the dog days of summer, it's a perk to wallow in inspired silliness."
0,Fresh,It's the detours on Eastwood's road movie- the stops along the way that show an old man dealing with the dim possibilities of change near the end of his life - that reveal this drug-mule-in-winter drama as a deeply personal reckoning.
1,Rotten,A beautiful but dull affair.
1,Rotten,"Permeated with dark shadows that recall Frankenstein and The Elephant Man, Unleashed features a quite clever premise before detouring into a plot twist that should've been muzzled."
0,Fresh,"Though not as good or gripping as his stunniung debut, Maria Full of Grace, this sophomore effort is a touching, relevant tale about social order and vengeance."
0,Fresh,"The film brings Charlize Theron on board as villainess, as well as a nuclear sub in the Arctic, a horde of cars speeding through New York City streets, a prison break battle royale, and a giant wrecking ball. It would be too much if it weren't so awesome."
1,Rotten,Funny little Nazis require rather more finesse than The Littlest Reich possesses.
1,Rotten,"Like its predecessor, Are We Done Yet? is amiable enough, but not enough to make it compelling."

1,Rotten,"Perry smirks and mugs throughout while Hurley just seems massively bored, practically yawning even while hoisting her shirt for the hotel clerk."
0,Fresh,"the best film of the year...it's time to see what Bill Murray's really capable of. If he isn't nominated for Oscars for the film, it'll be a disgrace."

0,Fresh,"Robbie, who produces as well as stars, is to be congratulated on making one of the few Oscar contenders that can be watched and enjoyed rather than endlessly analysed."
0,Fresh,"Neighbors, the latest of several movies to use that same title, attempts, yet again, to cash in on culture-clash of ordinary folks vs. wild folks."
0,Fresh,"This unapologetically raunchy comedy ought to be the vehicle that sets Ari Gaynor up for, at the very least, the chance to play the lead in an edgy sitcom or something."

0,Fresh,Crazy Rich Asians is a classic romantic comedy done right...
0,Fresh,McAvoy is deliberately unnerving for such a challenging and difficult role. He sends your emotions into a chaotic disarray...There are no boundaries and that's terrifying to even contemplate.

0,Fresh,"Dafne Keen plays Laura and hot diggity dog, she's actual perfection."
1,Rotten,"Via stylized language, fetishism, and some obvious erotic obsessions, the filmmakers have created one weirdly provocative film, which isn't very successful but ought still to be seen."
0,Fresh,"Digging in the style of an investigative reporter, Green creates a portrait of this pioneer in both her highly-paid success and later unhappiness... Happily, Green's intrepid research restores Guy-Blache to her rightful place in cinema history."
0,Fresh,"Narrative fiction can be a tunnel beneath borders that segregate us. Ebert's ""empathy machine"" metaphor is sexier than my analogy, but the idea is the same. This film is a soft, brief, genuine connection to a community that deserves compassion."
1,Rotten,"A mobster movie without whackings, a thriller without suspense and a courtroom drama without resolution, this turgid retelling of an unsolved missing-persons case functions mostly as a portrait of a young woman who loved too passionately."
1,Rotten,"Will probably have viewers and especially critics wanting to say hello to it, but having no problem saying good-bye. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)"
0,Fresh,"The incredible suspense builds up and puts too much weight into the final act of the film, which ends up being somewhat disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,A small masterpiece of tonal balance.
1,Rotten,"The considerable charms of Amy Adams' company can't sustain Leap Year, which, despite its name, putters along like any other normal, workaday cinematic offering, not a quadrennial breath of fresh air."
0,Fresh,"Naturally, the less said about the spooks themselves, the better."
1,Rotten,The characters in Year of the Dog are far more interesting than the events they take part in. And the setup is better than the payoff.
1,Rotten,"Richard Briers, Honor Blackman, Dudley Sutton - what were you or your agents thinking of?"
0,Fresh,"With admirably funkiness and bold flavor, Hill has made the anti-Blart...but at a time when we've seen seven mass shootings in a month, do we really need the comedy version of Taxi Driver?"
0,Fresh,"The film is excellent in every way -- acting, production, and evangelical outlook."
0,Fresh,It gets by on low-level sweetness and guile until delivering an unexpectedly powerful emotional sucker-punch at the end.
1,Rotten,"Despite Denzel giving it his best shot, Roman J. Israel, Esq. never passes the bar."
1,Rotten,One of the worst movies of 2015. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Button makes some powerful points about the precious commodities of love, happiness and time."
0,Fresh,"It's an oddity in his work that he lures us into grittily realistic drama only to dilute its potency with outlandish non-realistic imagery. The humanity and seriousness of his film-making, however, have made him an unignorable force for good."
0,Fresh,"Maybe it makes me some kind of feminist, but I like how in this picture, the Dream has nothing to do with nuptials..."
1,Rotten,"It fails to understand that poignancy isn't something you set out to try and be, and that trying to just makes you look pretentious."
1,Rotten,A very dull sequel that cries our for the same kind of larger-than-life hero played by Butler in the original. Worth watching only for Eva Green.
1,Rotten,Somehow The Deep End feels slightly... off.
1,Rotten,It's like the kind of lesson a schoolteacher might prepare for incredibly sleepy students.
0,Fresh,None of this is revelatory - these issues have been addressed in Iranian films before - but it's still gripping.
1,Rotten,"If this sounds like the recipe for a slick-but-vapid action picture, oui, it is."
0,Fresh,"The impressive watercolour backgrounds and intense focus on the smallest details make Spirited Away more than a kid's flick. It will grab hold and impress, amaze and entertain before letting you go."
0,Fresh,Is it a great movie? I don't think so. But it's a triumphant piece of filmmaking-journalism presented with the brio of drama.
0,Fresh,What works in this movie's favor is a tone that makes it feel less like a response to the Marvel Cinematic Universe than an escapee from the Troma Pictures vaults that somehow managed to evade release for the last quarter century.
0,Fresh,"I Am Legend is a blockbuster like no other, one that finds its grandness in modesty. It's a star vehicle with a star who knows his place in the universe."
1,Rotten,"A shouty, hammy, tedious, damp-squib firework display of dullness."
0,Fresh,"The movie is at its best when it's just about the one-upping maneuvers of interstellar con men (and women, and various nonhumans)."
1,Rotten,"this movie appears to exist because enough number crunchers came to believe that a DTV sequel to Escape Plan could eke out a profit, and a movie was set into production based upon that inspired notion."
0,Fresh,"Sprightly, colorful and fun...Familiarity with the characters will doubtlessly increase the enjoyment, but even the uninitiated should have a pleasant time."
1,Rotten,"Rather than being moved, you just feel sick."
0,Fresh,"The widescreen cinematography and mountain rain-forest locations retain their interest, as does the deftly incongruous score, which ranges from samba to hard rock."
0,Fresh,A fun film with awesome visual design. I think that over time detractors will mellow and Burton's Alice will become a classic. Bandersnatches and Futterwackens not withstanding.
0,Fresh,Time to check out (or into) The Grand Budapest Hotel.
0,Fresh,"This movie sure means well, and it's just entertaining enough to (slightly) slip off the shackles of the great cultural conformity factory it ultimately represents."
0,Fresh,A savvy and thought-provoking look at the nature of contemporary American politics.
1,Rotten,There was just something missing...the dumbness of the characters really pissed me off.
0,Fresh,"The film will put a big grin on your face, even if you don't find it laugh-out-loud funny. As tedious as they can be, sometimes watching movies about good people helping each other makes a world of difference."
1,Rotten,The film is almost saved from complete mediocrity by Emma Watson.
0,Fresh,"'Brillante, llena de energía y corazón, Chicago es un claro ejemplo de que el género musical no ha muerto y puede ser hecho con inteligencia, pésele a quien le pese.'"
0,Fresh,An extraordinary feat.
0,Fresh,"It's a domestic horror story that literally gets to us where we live, a disturbing tale told with uncompromising emotionality and great skill by filmmaker Lynne Ramsay."
1,Rotten,"It won't disappoint the many fans, but it won't win converts either."
1,Rotten,This is one motel comedy that does not warrant an extended stay.
0,Fresh,"Like a great modern song, it somehow feels new and classic at the same time."
0,Fresh,"With jeopardy at almost every turn, this is certainly no movie for toddlers."
0,Fresh,A perfectly fine family film ... with an entertaining premise that won't bore or disappoint anyone forced to sit through it with kids.
0,Fresh,A good movie of its type.
0,Fresh,"Shot over three years, this is one of the more considered and insightful Iraqi documentaries - although some may find its stylistic contrasts a little self-conscious and distracting."
0,Fresh,"Heikin, unlike so many impatient directors, knows that in a doc about musicians, the music should breathe."
0,Fresh,"Enjoyable, emotionally engaging and bittersweet relationship comedy with a sharply observed script, believably flawed characters and a pair of terrific central performances from Olivia Wilde and Jake Johnson."
0,Fresh,This is Taken if the Coen brothers had got the script first.
0,Fresh,"Exhilarating but never exploitative, Hotel Mumbai does for 26/11 what United 93 did for 9/11. So of course it makes sense that it took over a year for the film to secure distribution in a country whose people it honours so graciously."
1,Rotten,"Atmospheric it may be, but The Lighthouse is in other key respects very, very dull indeed."
1,Rotten,"As it stands now it is merely a movie that desperately wants to say something important and profound, but the best it can come up with is ""Boo!"""
1,Rotten,Disappointment reigns when you consider the gifts of this filmmaker.
1,Rotten,"Love Happens is a comedy in mourning, a romance so sad that even Jennifer Aniston at her most engaging can't save it."
0,Fresh,Director Hugh Hudson maintains a steady hand throughout in this low-key but powerful rumination on faith and reason.
0,Fresh,"At its best, calls to mind some devilish delights of the 1970s, from the antique-toy-stuffed manor of Sleuth to the jet set's homicidal party games in The Last of Sheila to the ever-resilient final girl of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
0,Fresh,Entertaining war flick shadowed by superior original.
0,Fresh,A kaiju-sized step up from the monster's 2014 Legendary Pictures debut
1,Rotten,"American Christmas, a franchise as exportable as Valentine's Day or Halloween. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"""Chapter 2"" is state-of-the-art action that's sacrificed some of the charm and heart that were the first film's secret weapon. It's about the only armament not deployed in this sequel."
0,Fresh,"The live performances are dope...even The Time! However, the treatment of women was a bit abysmal, though at the time it was acceptable...the movie itself is entertaining."
1,Rotten,"LCD Soundsystem's die-hard fanbase will appreciate this concert documentary, but few others are likely to think it demands big-screen viewing."
0,Fresh,"Good Time isn't an exuberant or happy-go-lucky emotional ride, rather it's the cruel irony of white privileged in even the lowest rungs of class."
1,Rotten,I dare you to try sitting through the middle 70 minutes.
0,Fresh,"If you want to draw some life lessons from it all, go ahead: That's your choice, and it's easy to do. But '50/50' isn't going to beat you about the head with it."
0,Fresh,An entertaining mess full of jarring editing and artsy touches.
0,Fresh,"Considering the facts of the still-unsolved Robert Durst case, this underwhelming docudrama from Andrew Jarecki should leave more of an impression."
1,Rotten,"It's trendy to complain that movies aren't as good as they were in the past, but there's usually a reason why conventions evolve."
0,Fresh,"[D]irector Jon Watts' sequel isn't as tightly focused or effortlessly charming as 2017's ""Homecoming,"" yet it continues Holland's amazing Spidey run and introduces Jake Gyllenhaal in his top-notch first comic-book role."
0,Fresh,It presumably won't change many minds and those not already predisposed to the music of CSNY but those with a predilection for either the singers or the sentiments will likely finds this film to be a valuable document indeed.
0,Fresh,"The story, in other words, is pure Hollywood gold, full of opportunities for stirring speeches, ethical quandaries, lessons about tolerance and humanity, and violence against Nazis."
0,Fresh,"Man Push Cart, written and directed by Ramin Bahrani, attempts to put a human face on the men (and it is generally men) who work inside these tin boxes."
0,Fresh,"A lopsided gem full of off-kilter humor, hard truths and real emotion. Great for preteens and up."
0,Fresh,"Much like recent animated efforts such as ""Shrek"", ""Lilo & Stitch"" has lots of humour and sly pop cultural references that will appeal to adults . . ."
0,Fresh,Lathan convincingly brings a lot of depth to a role that could have easily been one-note in another performer's hands.
1,Rotten,"The worst thing about Mortal Engines is that you can see, in fits and starts and flashes, the movie it could've been."
1,Rotten,"Here, while the routines are as polished as ever, everything else is tired, not least Fat Amy's fat jokes. Time for a new song, ladies."
1,Rotten,Not a dimension to which you'll want to cross over.
1,Rotten,An inept black farce about two 19th century bodysnatchers that couldn't be more lifeless if it was one of their victims.
1,Rotten,"A return to the goofy and familiar, Vern!"
0,Fresh,Terrific in its primitive way.
0,Fresh,"A life-affirming, inspirational story about family, hope and love that tugs at your heartstrings."
0,Fresh,Zombieland doesn't find quite the same balance of laughs and scares as Shaun of the Dead did -- it's much heavier on the comedy than the horror -- but its similar focus on three-dimensional characters rather than the genre's typical cardboar
0,Fresh,Margot is all mood swings and cries for help that everyone can hear except the person making them. It is Squid sapped of empathy and desperate for love.
0,Fresh,"This is one of those movies in which pacing, dialogue and the right actors enliven a familiar story."
1,Rotten,"The story [Besson] co-wrote for Arthur is workable, even clever at times, but the visualization of the Minimoys and their crib is weird and almost aggressively off-putting -- like an episode of When CGI Attacks!"
0,Fresh,Aniston is thoroughly appealing.
0,Fresh,"Director Stroman (who also choreographed the film) has also paid tribute to the theatre by casting such stage stars as Brent Barrett, Debra Monk, Karen Ziemba and Andrea Martin."
1,Rotten,Those of you who were waiting so impatiently for the release of this movie version of Elizabeth Wurtzel's chemically enhanced Weltschmerz will be as sorry as the film itself...
0,Fresh,"While ""Wanted"" is a comic book movie, the director, Kazakh filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov, has wisely dumped a lot of the schoolboy nihilism that made Mark Millar's six-issue miniseries a sometimes disagreeable read."
1,Rotten,This feeble followup to 2010's godawful Clash of the Titans sucketh the mighty big one.
0,Fresh,"Watching these scared, alienated kids turn into a family is a moving demonstration of the power of art."
1,Rotten,"Both actors are trapped by the rigid banality of their characters, and they fail to manufacture any chemistry -- without that heat, this is just a story about a contract negotiation."
0,Fresh,"Blake Lively emerges as a delectable, bonafide star in this diverting if muddled modern noir."
1,Rotten,Don't even think of stopping.
1,Rotten,"It's a sorry statement, when the actor that has the most subtle performance is the kid with Tourette's."
0,Fresh,"A unique vision, strong execution (in action, wit, and humor) as well as compelling characters culminate in one of the year's best dark horse hits."
1,Rotten,"Switching the hero from a lone driver to a couple spoils the original's most intriguing idea: that the mass-murdering jackal may be the driver's own escaped id. That leaves little to fill 83 expendable minutes, which barely register as a movie."
0,Fresh,The real-life parallels certainly lends Sea Fever an extra level of chilling intrigue.
0,Fresh,...it's hard to dislike something so cheerful and uplifting as this movie.
0,Fresh,"Spider-Man 2 is spectacular, mostly because it's more 'Man' than 'Spider.'"
0,Fresh,A worthy follow-up to a classic.
0,Fresh,"Even though [the actors] excel, the constant ping-ponging back and forth to make sure everything is included does subvert their success."
0,Fresh,Draft Day isn't even really about football. It's about coming into your own and finding clarity at a personal and professional crossroads. It's about doing your job. It's a day in the life.
1,Rotten,"Unsurprisingly, the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers, instead of serious athletes."
0,Fresh,The funniest movie we currently have that involves a hot tub capable of time travel.
0,Fresh,"Excellent sight gags, clever dialogue, and improbable waistline."
0,Fresh,"The closest thing Wilder made to a horror film (in lighting, score, and character dynamic) after The Lost Weekend."
0,Fresh,"A fascinating film offering a startling look inside one of the most tightlipped intelligence agencies on the planet, and providing powerful resonances with the US and UK's ""war on terror""."
0,Fresh,Sandler goes through a Scrooge story where he learns to step beyond contemporary arrogance - the very film persona that made his comedies popular.
1,Rotten,It is the latter word in the title that most accurately describes the film: suck.
1,Rotten,New rule: Only one decapitation per ancient action movie.
1,Rotten,Delevingne is plain. The soundtrack is flat and bland. The film photography satisfy but does not provide. Cinematically is average with the usual voiceover that solves all kinds of problems. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"A film ought to have something more to recommend it than a high degree of strangeness, but being strange is what this film is all about. Resistance to this film's goofy charm is futile."
1,Rotten,Puts the 'oy' into cloying.
0,Fresh,"The film may be more of a mess than the inside of Bourne's head, but its quirks, strangely enough, are what keep it interesting."
1,Rotten,"A noisy, hectic and largely unthrilling adventure."
0,Fresh,Labyrinth has stood the test of time astonishingly well.
0,Fresh,"Like the inspiration for its title, there's a wild sweetness to the people - and maybe even to the land - depicted with such breathtaking honesty and raw beauty in ""American Honey."""
0,Fresh,"This version lacks some of the economy of the first, and, unusually for Hitchcock, it sags in the middle. Fortunately, there's a marked improvement as it reaches the last third."
1,Rotten,"It might appeal to the action junkie, and that's fine - there's an audience for that. If I come in expecting to shift my brain into neutral, I'm willing to do that. I might even enjoy it. But don't tease me with overtures of something more if you can't de"
1,Rotten,Even Dwayne Johnson couldn't save this sequel.
1,Rotten,There is an interesting film to be made about our increasingly complex relationship with technology and how it has seeped insidiously into every social ritual. Unfortunately that film has already been completed and it was called Her.
0,Fresh,Great performance in a thin mystery.
0,Fresh,A romantic comedy about the emotional makeover of a self-absorbed workaholic man.
1,Rotten,"Robin Williams' character can't decide when to be goofy and when to play it straight, and neither can this uneven ""what-if"" political comedy from writer-director Barry Levinson."
0,Fresh,A costume drama well acted but marred by hazy film quality.
1,Rotten,"Pardon us, Mother Bates, may we borrow your knife?"
0,Fresh,"Would You Rather is a horror film in the truest sense, opening up frightening doors in our minds and making us look at parts of ourselves. It's not easy, but it is well-done and extremely compelling."
0,Fresh,"Trading in pleasures of a deliberately rarefied sort, writer-director Andrew Dominik's talky, character-rich genre piece largely short-circuits thrills to sketch a grimly funny portrait of thugs taking care of business, in every rotten sense of the word."
0,Fresh,"Christopher Nolan has created a true masterpiece here: experimental in structure, gripping storytelling, haunting in tone, and more terrifying than most horror movies."
1,Rotten,"Very little happens in the way of narrative or character development, which leaves the film over-reliant on a central chemistry that isn't really there."
0,Fresh,"A well-detailed, fevered fantasy of how one sunny day in L.A. can go terribly, entertainingly wrong."
0,Fresh,"With henna tattoos drawing parallels between Indian tradition and the lesbian lifestyle, it's a canny sitcom."
0,Fresh,A surprisingly ambivalent entry in genre that's usually brain-dead.
0,Fresh,"Some films exist entirely on their own terms, while others benefit from a bit of backstory."
1,Rotten,"Gaghan aims to Scorsese, but ends up even away from David O. Russell. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,The bright colors and vibrant backgrounds ... go a long way in distracting from shortcomings in the story and style of this offhand hybrid.
0,Fresh,A surprisingly funny and entertaining package.
0,Fresh,"A streamlined razor-ride of a movie: taut, riveting, and a psychological horror show that will leave nail-marks in your palms for days afterwards."
0,Fresh,"This is the ultimate female take-back-the-narrative movie, and frankly a lot of it is silly and sophomoric. But it's also juicy and fun ..."
0,Fresh,It shows a maturing in Perry's work from the pandering of his men-are-all-dogs films.
0,Fresh,In spite of its dated ways -- or perhaps because of them -- it just may be the most youthful film you'll see this summer.
0,Fresh,"Tarantino on acid subversive sixties stoner satire. But a combo ballsy big screen intersection of politics, publicity and propaganda that couldn't be more provocatively in the here and now concerning truth in movies and the media - if there ever was any."
0,Fresh,"Seann William Scott is the main reason to sit through this sexually loaded, extremely raunchy offering."
1,Rotten,"Strains to build up a head of comic steam, but there's nowhere very interesting to go."
0,Fresh,"As 'Chi-Raq''s world expands, Lee's true target comes into focus: Chi-Raq is Chicago is America, and we are all, in our own way, responsible."
1,Rotten,"Despite its many laughable moments, the box-office gods may not be amused."
0,Fresh,"[Schwarzenneger's] transformation in to kids film star is nearly seamless, as he's able to connect with his primarily younger cast surprisingly well, and garners a strong chemistry with just about everyone in the film."
0,Fresh,The Rider has a wisdom all its own. ... It becomes a film about how the pain of loss and disappointment enables us to bear one another's burdens.
0,Fresh,"Dev Patel as Ramanujan and Jeremy Irons as his Cambridge mentor both impress and there's a top-notch supporting cast that includes Toby Jones, Jeremy Northam and the late Richard Johnson, whose last film this was."
0,Fresh,You leave the theatre a trifle exhausted but rewarded by a resonance few films possess.
1,Rotten,"In its eagerness to give voice to the overshadowed daughter, the film never allows the mother to live."
1,Rotten,"Capital ends up being neither a high-stakes thriller nor a cutting commentary on real-world bad behavior. It's just CEO exotica, all dressed up with nowhere to go."
0,Fresh,"By the Sea's uncompromising nature is its most admirable asset. It's a vanity project that's difficult to love, but alluring to unpack."
0,Fresh,"The Queen is the most reverent irreverent comedy imaginable. Or maybe it's the most irreverent reverent comedy. Either way, it's a small masterpiece."
0,Fresh,"Once we understand the principle (if not the details) of the plot, Wicker Park works because the actors invest their scenes with what is, under the circumstances, astonishing emotional realism."
1,Rotten,"An Acceptable Loss is a film that thinks it's deep and profound when, in reality, it's incredibly shallow."
0,Fresh,"Regardless of its flimsy emotional interior, Ricki is a worthy addition in this year's growing canon of strong female-centred films, and it would be wise to remember Streep's stunning performance come awards season."
0,Fresh,"Rogue One features stirring action scenes, vivid characterisation and one or two truly eye-popping explosions. Nonetheless, what it lacks is any real originality."
1,Rotten,"There's much more plot floating around during the sequel, all leading up to a climax at the ""KEN Conference"" that suffers in comparison to Silicon Valley's mockery of the same milieu."
0,Fresh,"The Bourne Identity is always lucid and rarely boring -- after Bad Company, it seems particularly expert."
0,Fresh,"The element of surprise, well-crafted characters, setting, and dialogue make this film an excellent dish for lovers of the genre. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,Frankenheimer rams the plot through turnstiles of gibberish!
1,Rotten,The idea is cartoonish in its essence but the pic is shot and played with such straight-faced realism that Swallow becomes utterly ridiculous.
1,Rotten,Suicide Squad is an exposition dump masquerading as a cinematic experience.
0,Fresh,"Brilliantly directed, beautifully shot and superbly written, this is a riotously entertaining and frequently hilarious drama with an Oscar-worthy central performance from Leonardo DiCaprio."
0,Fresh,Cohen ... loads the film with pow.
0,Fresh,Yakin makes no attempt to pacify traditional horror fans but he also doesn't go so far off the deep end that the movie makes no sense.
1,Rotten,"An entirely laugh-free 83 minutes, spent in the company of irritating characters."
0,Fresh,"Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both fine actors, but you'd be hard pressed to sit engrossed in a conversation between any actors that goes on for more than a couple of minutes. Usually. But not here."
1,Rotten,This is one romance that did not flourish and you can save a pretty penny by not seeing it.
0,Fresh,Formulaic writing is more than made up for by awesome visceral thrills.
0,Fresh,"A daft premise does little to detract from the enjoyment of this tense, well-made murder mystery."
1,Rotten,"Little Woods stands as a serious attempt to explore lives that seldom find their way to the screen, and Thompson's performance keeps the wheels turning."
1,Rotten,"Meticulous in its adherence to conventional narrative inducement, this biopic only offers a sanded-down and embossed vision of Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde's 30-year marriage."
0,Fresh,"In any other hands this might seem like paper-thin stuff, but Streisand's a consummate professional with the Midas touch."
0,Fresh,"As with Love is Strange, Sachs shows his love of little moments, nuanced behaviour and unforced, if occasionally forceful, performances, with the turns from the lads oozing with naturalism."
0,Fresh,"Although it often stumbles into gaudily hedonistic mud-rolling, Jon S. Baird's film boasts a bold tone, sharp dialogue and a towering performance from James McAvoy."
0,Fresh,Cruise's inexhaustible appetite for creating wow-worthy stunts and action-packed set-pieces doesn't disappoint.
1,Rotten,"If it's true that if you put 1,000,000 monkeys at 1,000,000 typewriters, one will type out Hamlet, the script for this film is what the other 999,999 will produce."
1,Rotten,The film is shoddy from frame one.
1,Rotten,"Not bad as an introduction to a group, but it makes for a lousy portrait of its members."
1,Rotten,"While the movie's execution never quite makes up for its conception, it does elevate it above, well, just being the sort of movie that would be called Newlyweeds."
0,Fresh,"If filmgoers ultimately feel bogged down in its densely layered fable and allegory, it's a spectacular thicket to get lost in."
1,Rotten,[A] frenetic jumble of subplots and sleazy characters...
0,Fresh,"As the doc shows, they're a miraculous species, capable of extreme heroism, self-sacrifice, sorrow and unshakable love."
0,Fresh,"""Wanderlust'' may lack the satiric edge of Albert Brooks' ""Lost in America,'' but it does deliver more big laughs than most comedies these days."

0,Fresh,It's a delicious appetizer but you'll crave more.
1,Rotten,"Most of it seems like pointless goofing around, offering lots of filth and very little semblance of wisdom."
0,Fresh,"...a vivid, first-hand look at the hatred and hysteria that politics can evoke."
0,Fresh,"The movie isn't just about Schmidt as a personality, it's a portrait of his world, and Payne and co-writer Taylor show a rare compassion for the superficially comfortable."
0,Fresh,"As Nim is heralded, befriended, sold, rescued, refuted, forgotten and more, his epic cautionary tale thoughtfully examines the inherent dangers of man trying to remake his fellow creatures in his own image."
1,Rotten,"Rather than challenging the form, the movie can't resist capitulating to it."
0,Fresh,"While the story loses its footing in the final third of the film, Their Finest does boast a fantastic cast that manages to keep you invested in the narrative even after it feels like it's over."
0,Fresh,"So well done, it makes you regret Eastwood's determination to grind an ax on this intriguing story."
1,Rotten,"Pixels' predecessors, such as Ghostbusters, had an irreverent disrespect for authority and a deadpan outlook, but few of the many elements here are developed beyond the rudimentary."
0,Fresh,"The trick to the Men II Boyz comic genre -- where grown men are simply older, pudgier versions of their teen selves, struggling to find their place in the world -- is to find the surprises and payoffs within the Peter Pan syndrome."
1,Rotten,"No ticket-buying constituency is likely to feel well-served by The Foreigner, a chilly marriage of political thriller and latter-day Liam Neeson-style geriatric revenge-o-rama."
0,Fresh,The film's apparent nave charm started working on me until I was hooked by its schleppy hero-filmmaker and its screwy -- borderline stalker -- premise.
1,Rotten,Nothing works properly and with genuine conviction in The Last Thing He Wanted. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"[Director Joe Lynch] stages the action cleanly and kinetically. And Hayek delivers a fully committed performance, handling the role's intense physical demands with commanding authority."
1,Rotten,"The Condemned, directed by Scott Wiper (appropriate last name), is a bad rip-off of the 2000 Japanese sensation Battle Royale and the 1932 U.S. classic The Most Dangerous Game."
1,Rotten,a puffed up popcorn flick that is not without a certain kitschy charm
1,Rotten,Better material and more adept direction might've made this a perfectly solid commercial enterprise.
1,Rotten,"The jokes in Warner Bros.'s new animated flick mostly fall flat, the characters are largely unlovable and the simplistic plot expects more from its audience than it gives."
1,Rotten,"It sure is pretty, but it's also woefully empty-headed, as steely in emotion as it is in its environment."
1,Rotten,It's great to a female-led action film but Atomic Blonde is a few notches below John Wick.
1,Rotten,Who's your daddy? Who cares.
0,Fresh,"The filmmakers don't shy from set pieces that would be astonishing even without their central gimmick. They set themselves a challenge for ""1917"", and met it in ways sure to be talked about by lovers of cinema for quite a while."
1,Rotten,"Depending on your age, Duff is either the perfect big sister or the perfect baby sitter. She is not the perfect actress, though."
0,Fresh,"I wish Jones spent a little more time on Truffaut's filmography where we can see Hitchcock's influence. But still, hugely entertaining and informative, the film is a required viewing for any serious cinephiles."
0,Fresh,"It's not high art, but Pierre Salvadori's sunny romantic comedy Priceless is certainly funny."
0,Fresh,"If viewers disarm themselves of expectations but keep in mind references to decades past, then Moonwalkers will provide entertainment and few LOL moments."
1,Rotten,"In a cardinal sin of genre filmmaking, [Clay] Staub also lets his audience figure out the twists before his characters do, all while he overexplains the plot"
0,Fresh,"Beneath the wingtips, pointy shoes and '50s sexual politics...Down with Love is light, airy and fun - almost to the level of cheap laughs. It's all surface spit and polish."
0,Fresh,"As someone who failed to appreciate the 'Sex and the City' TV series, I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie celebration of friendship."
0,Fresh,Damaged LAPD detective in search of redemption is the theme of this gritty thriller in which Nicole Kidman strips her physical veneer in what is certainly the most unglamorous role of her career.
1,Rotten,Canopy doesn't fully convey the horror and the isolation these men must have experienced. It's a conceptually bold film but not a fully achieved one.
1,Rotten,The biggest shock (aside from seeing how arbitrarily movies are chosen for theatrical release) is provided by an intrusively blown newspaper.
0,Fresh,"A mesmerising film, and one that will linger in the imagination long after the sounds of the crickets have faded."
0,Fresh,Tom Holland's directorial debut is a wildly entertaining concoction that perfectly blends horror and comedy. Roddy McDowall steals the show as TV horror host Peter Vincent.
0,Fresh,"Artfully polished, but an inhumanely cruel, repetitive, murderous vendetta casts a dreary shadow over the last hour of the film."
0,Fresh,"is a sharply observed psychological drama that takes time to focus on small, but not insignificant, moments of high emotion"
0,Fresh,Each scene plays out like a cleverly crafted vignette that gives the film a freshness and propulsion often missing from the romantic comedy genre. It also doesn't hurt to throw the looming apocalypse in there for good measure.
0,Fresh,"Its ultimate message may be that, rather than gaming being a way for misfits to escape from reality, rolling the dice and spinning yarns may be what is finest and most creative about them."
0,Fresh,"One of the most intense theater-going experiences I've had in years. It is more than just a great movie, it's a giant leap forward for the art of cinema."
0,Fresh,Nuance typifies both Mr. Thornton's highly calibrated performance and the film's absence of unnecessary underlining.
1,Rotten,Slow to gather momentum and generates little excitement or tension.
1,Rotten,"While this did bring the level of hilarity expected from the drunken Sparrow, a new look into his past, and a wonderfully immersive setting all brought to life by its classic score, it's an inconsequential chapter in this swashbuckling series."
0,Fresh,"Despite Russell's self-indulgent streak, he earns credit for his ambition, for imbuing a stellar cast with his own bizarre spirit, and for pulling it off with wit and style."
0,Fresh,The finest moments of Tully play like an insight to this female future of storytelling.
1,Rotten,Doesn't really go anywhere. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Although there are some scary moments here, and a lot of gruesome ones, this isn't a horror film so much as a faux eco-documentary."
0,Fresh,"There are echoes, a little DNA of ""Wings of Desire"" here."
0,Fresh,"This is not an easy film to watch but it's relevant, courageous and full of grace."
1,Rotten,"...bloated, obvious and - most damningly - immediately irrelevant."
0,Fresh,"The movie is alternately brutal and affecting, filled with big dreams and crushing realities."
0,Fresh,"The laughs here are plentiful, largely from Schumer, although she spreads the wealth quite a bit, to a cast that goes 30 or 40 deep"
0,Fresh,Stirring story of Maori culture
0,Fresh,"The inventive choreography, animation detail, and stylish production design beg to be seen on the big screen. If the plot hadn't felt like a major recycling of the 2004 movie, it would surprise, but there's plenty outside the story mechanics to delight."
0,Fresh,"Even if you can't get into Johnston's music (count me in that group), this is to be filed under ""must-see."""
0,Fresh,"In the end, Overlord offers what it promises, with nothing but pure entertainment in the style of a 60s genre film. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Zellweger saves the day, even when she's just going through the motions."
1,Rotten,Joel David Moore's film is too often distracted by irrelevant emotional grandstanding.
0,Fresh,The director's perenially heavy mood seems especially well suited to this indigo-shaded story of a black American saxman (Dexter Gordon) living and performing in Paris in the late 50s.
1,Rotten,"Salles, an intelligent director whose films include ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" doesn't invest ""On the Road"" with the wildness it needs for its visual style, narrative approach and leads."
0,Fresh,"Asks all the right questions, and it suggests, fascinatingly, that the same amoral melodramatics that are playing out on the national sports scene are destined to play out locally."
0,Fresh,"Agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) distinguishes herself in many ways among the genre's spies, from her vodka fetish to her bold fashion sense to her savage fighting skills and not least, to her sensual beauty."
0,Fresh,"All of this comes to life in the movie thanks to the film-makers' inventiveness, but - even more so - thanks to the performance of Andy Serkis as Dury."
1,Rotten,So underdeveloped you'll want to shake it.
1,Rotten,...suffers from an often unwatchable first half that admittedly does give way to a passable final stretch...
0,Fresh,Andrew Haigh's wonderfully performed 45 Years is an elegant and restrained film that dwells on how an apparently happy union can be tormented by an echo from the past.
0,Fresh,"[Kathryn] Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal...have made the first fictional feature about American soldiers in Iraq that doesn't fall apart, or preach to a choir, or turn into a position paper."
0,Fresh,"As good as the film is, Beethoven remains mysterious. He refuses to roll over, so to speak."
0,Fresh,"While it's lead by a strange, lopsided and unwieldy first act, its intentions fully crystallize in its second, and finds some kind of inner peace, finally ending on a more definitive and hopeful note..."
1,Rotten,"Illiterate, often inert sci-fi action thriller."
1,Rotten,"This movie had a lot of potential, but missed the mark for me, which is almost worse than a film being a complete waste of time."
1,Rotten,"Even if you're like me and find most musical biopics depressingly formulaic, you might think Oliver Dahan's Edith Piaf movie is a slight cut above."
0,Fresh,A truly great western.
1,Rotten,The movie becomes one more David-and-Goliath morality play.
1,Rotten,"The young actors are irredeemably bland, and two of the adults are hammy enough to make James Brown seem controlled."
0,Fresh,Rarely do you get a movie trilogy where all three films are fantastic.
0,Fresh,"A beautifully conceived early work from Mann, Manhunter has aged like a fine Chianti."
0,Fresh,Black is consistently hilarious -- and not just in his dreams of moshpit glory.
0,Fresh,"1917 is one of the best war films I have ever seen. Epic from beginning to end, it truly captures the horrors of trench warfare."
0,Fresh,"A buoyant, light-hearted encore of a movie, paying tribute to the Stones as indefatigable elder statesmen who still go out every night and put on a great show."
0,Fresh,"The film is a magnificent showcase for Jones, the talented actress giving one of the best performances of her career."
0,Fresh,"Allied is pure pop filmmaking. But while it may not be especially introspective, unlike a lot of Zemeckis movies, it's actually about something."
0,Fresh,"Maurice is a candid, lucid, passionate film."
1,Rotten,The entire film is predicated on turgid slapstick bits that simply congratulate viewers for having seen a handful of recent studio blockbusters.
1,Rotten,From the Land of the Moon is not without merit -Cotillard's expressive face is compulsively watchable- but be prepared for some significant suspension of disbelief.
1,Rotten,"The Wretched (written and directed by brothers Brett Pierce and Drew Pierce) devolves into an incoherent mess in the last 20 minutes of the film, thereby wasting the potential that it had in the beginning of the story."
0,Fresh,The single greatest sci-fi camp fest ever put on celluloid. This film boasts the perfect blend of goofy cheese and unhinged imagination.
0,Fresh,"Not as scary nor as atmospheric as The Ring, but it's nonetheless creepy, suspenseful and an improvement on the sequel with great visual effects and sound design/editing."
0,Fresh,Bottom line: the story satisfies and the jokes avoid juvenile cliches.
0,Fresh,"Smart, brisk political satire, so smoothly done and performed that it overrides certain weaknesses and a climactic sentimental face change."
1,Rotten,"The result is a film more educational than engrossing; high schoolers should see it - the rest of us, maybe not."
0,Fresh,You're likely to be as smiling as much as George Valentin.
1,Rotten,"Flat when it should fizzle, formulaic when it should be diverting and plodding when it should flow, it is at best -- and it pains me to say it -- a masterclass in mediocrity."
1,Rotten,"It's one thing watching the final credits roll to see the names of the voice cast, but by the time they detail all the people who worked on the film's 'Data and Pipeline Infrastructure', you'll be more than ready for the exit."
0,Fresh,"An incredibly moving experience to watch the struggles everyone went through, all framed by the protest songs of the time and what they represented to those in the trenches."
1,Rotten,"The movie breaks out the usual clichs of the genre ... There is absolutely no chemistry on screen between Butler and Aniston, and the movie is utterly forgettable"
0,Fresh,"Some of the results ring false, but the memorable theme song and some equally memorable character acting (by Thomas Mitchell and Lon Chaney Jr. more than Lloyd Bridges and Katy Jurado) help things along."
1,Rotten,While there's nothing wrong with M:I III... I found myself wondering if we really needed to bother getting off the couch for it.
0,Fresh,"Solondz's masterstroke is to have the girl, Aviva, played by eight different actors of varying ages, sizes and races -- a move that should decimate the film's narrative coherence but instead ups its allegorical value immeasurably."
0,Fresh,"Embrace the bad-guy version of being good, and how visibly uncomfortable that fit is on the members of Suicide Squad, and you'll find some fun."
0,Fresh,"It's painful to admit it, but the tiny, perky FX mouse in jeans and sweater once again carries the summer's most enjoyable kids' movie."
0,Fresh,"Great acting, but soap opera-ish. Not for kids."
0,Fresh,"Though it has plenty of shocks, the film creates a wasteland that would be compellingly deranged even without vampires pressing insistently at every border. Horror is just the half of it."
1,Rotten,"A middling, overly predictable comedy."
1,Rotten,"Inherent Vice is a bizarre, almost dreamlike, movie, one that makes sense from moment to moment but falls apart the second you try to tie it all together."
1,Rotten,"""Pacific Rim"" puts the ""disaster"" in ""disaster movie."""
0,Fresh,"Gorgeously styled and impeccably shot, but the movie rarely transcends symbolism ..."
1,Rotten,Things start to go awry when we realize that the film's emotional sensitivity doesn't go much deeper than its moody surfaces.
0,Fresh,"Words of Love always feels more like an abstract art piece than a true biography. In doing so, the film becomes a loving testament to the sacred bond between two passing ships."
0,Fresh,"While 28 Weeks Later ultimately falls shy of classic status, there are several hard-to-shake scenes -- nightmare visions, really -- that reveal the infected populace to be far less dangerous to the fabric of a civilized society."
1,Rotten,"The only moments where the film tries to do something of consequence with the plot, tying back (albeit barely) into the gene research drama that kicked off the series, end up being pretty dumb."
0,Fresh,"The Russo brothers, writers and cast really outdid themselves with this one, and this is evident in the witty script, multiple plot twists and scenes that will have you erupting in laughter or holding your breath."
0,Fresh,"Strong performances, especially by Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Foxx and Tim Blake Nelson, help make the message a movie."
1,Rotten,It's actually rare for me to see a film that is such an utter failure on so many levels.
0,Fresh,A nondramatic work best appreciated as a pure image-and-sound event.
0,Fresh,"Modern musicals start here, and Busby Berkeley's genius bursts into full flower."
0,Fresh,It's slickly shot and enjoyable.
0,Fresh,Well-enough executed for a flick on a modest budget to forgive the tendency towards melodrama. With a tenderhearted payoff arriving when the Prodigal Daughter asks her father for forgiveness during a teachable moment of mutual redemption.
1,Rotten,"Like the original, it's ultra loud and often looks like a PlayStation game. But when the fast and furious bludgeoning and blow-ups wane, the screen may as well be tuned to channel zero."
0,Fresh,"Pleasant and cheerful, and that sort of thing should be encouraged sometimes."
0,Fresh,"Alfonso Cuarón's triumph is an invigoratingly clean, elegant display of action choreography, a La Région Centrale you can still take grandma to see."
0,Fresh,"Think of EAT, PRAY, LOVE which has a similar sort of journey and this is so much better than that."
0,Fresh,"Martin Scorsese's masterful account of Bob Dylan's 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue contains predictable treasures, jolting surprises, and a mischievous sprinkle of untruths."
1,Rotten,Perhaps these conundrums will be answered in future installments (Resident Evil: Coherence?) but I wouldn't hold my breath. Best to just send in the clones.
0,Fresh,"This hybrid of survivalist action and young-adult drama remains watchable from start to finish, even if it never becomes essential."
0,Fresh,"The result is a triumph, certain to be regarded as not just one Trek's better moments, but one of the finest films made in the sci-fi genre."
0,Fresh,"The Notorious Bettie Page is about the mundane but living humanity behind the pictures, the regular person behind a decade's fantasies."
0,Fresh,"It may not be particularly original, but it should be of interest to history buffs, or to those who want to see one of Gary Oldman's finest performances. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,The lack of plausible conflict mars the movie's highly commendable depiction of San Francisco as a the new porn capital.
1,Rotten,"Despite its stars, despite its premise, and despite the presence of cute canines, ""Must Love Dogs"" is the most bland romantic comedy of the summer. Possibly of the year."
0,Fresh,"Avengers: Endgame is, in every way, Loki deficient. Otherwise, it's a pretty darn good movie."
1,Rotten,"The first half of it just feels unnecessary, with lots of wheel-spinning, and then the second half is just a lot of pandering to people who should have been ignored."
1,Rotten,"Add this to the pile of crap legacy sequels like ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" and ""Blues Brothers 2000."""
0,Fresh,"""The Tree of Life"" is at times trying and perplexing, but it also contains some of the most psychologically insightful and ecstatic filmmaking imaginable."
0,Fresh,"Larson delivers every line to perfection and, as it happens, there's not one weak link in the cast."
1,Rotten,"I'm not sure there's a lot more to say about heroin addiction, but if there is, Candy doesn't say it."
0,Fresh,"The Irishman stands as a testament to cinematic storytelling, and to how much power four old warhorses can still harness."
0,Fresh,No film that I've yet seen better captures the dismal mood that gripped the city in the wake of the [9/11] attacks...
0,Fresh,"The film offers an accurate portrait of the pursuit of a dream - one in which talent is just part of the equation, and reality, sooner or later, comes crashing down."
0,Fresh,"Like T'Challa's step toward becoming a world leader, Black Panther shows the next generation of comic book films how it's done."
1,Rotten,"Bulling ahead through hackneyed scene after hackneyed scene, it grinds out an hour and 48 minutes of nonstop cliche, never offering so much as a marginally clever line, never succumbing to an original thought, never veering from the rutted path."
0,Fresh,"Personally, I don't think a day has gone by since I have seen it when I haven't thought of some aspect about it and found myself grinning helplessly as a result."
0,Fresh,"It can be cheesy and trite and predictable at times, but the sheer breakneck pace and frenetic energy of these Trials are more than enough to whip the movie along the rails of a well-done, generic, teen-centric action flick."
0,Fresh,"Through it all, Weinstein, the veteran, and Drew Taylor, making his directorial debut, weave an intelligent, complex and tension-filled story that breathes life into historical events that are fast fading from our collective memory."
0,Fresh,"In a game of mirrors between postmodernity and simple occurrence, the film plays represents the ways in which the protagonist is both an excessive, fat and great, Christian Bale and the obesity of our most intimate stupidity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"It's a remarkable story, but director Sean Ellis doesn't really do it justice, resorting to lots of shaky cam cinematography to convey the chaos of the times and saddling his actors with Euro-pudding accents and clunky dialogue."
0,Fresh,"[The film has] blood in abundance, and a social message too. Mostly blood, though, along with a quick, solid pace to the narrative, with effective performances to boot."
1,Rotten,"There isn't a milliliter of honest feeling from start to finish, and precious little comedy or romance."
1,Rotten,"Another video game adaptation fail, but the blockbuster time drain isn't entirely in vain. Its mindless entertainment is excellent background noise for making out at home."
1,Rotten,An ultimately dull nonaffair.
1,Rotten,[W]hy do the male cows have udders?.. This isn't supposed to be the animated version of TransAmerica.
1,Rotten,"Offers fairly meagre chills. Still, the script has a few inventive (if not necessarily credible) moves up its sleeve."
0,Fresh,"George Sidney's tacky 1963 musical fantasy-satire about the Elvis craze, based on the Broadway show of the same title, isn't exactly good, but if you like what he does with Ann-Margret, Janet Leigh, and pink decor, it's sort of magnificent."
0,Fresh,"Stylistically, Abu Nowar's first film is an impressive effort, one that's artfully nail-biting and that shows a keen eye for picking out natural beauty in the most desolate of landscapes."
0,Fresh,Eddie the Eagle might just tap into that teeming ocean of Saturday night punter-hood that lies somewhere between Mamma Mia! and Made in Dagenham.
0,Fresh,"Given its obviously commercial aims, Ghost is remarkably appealing on a purely personal level. It is about how you deal with death."
0,Fresh,"Game Change, which explores how smart people make dumb decisions, is a movie for all of us."
0,Fresh,"Refreshingly honest and down-to-earth portrait of the struggle of Jeff Bauman, who lost his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing."
0,Fresh,About Time... in many other ways [is] gentle and compassionate.
0,Fresh,"For anyone who wondered where the real people in American movies went to, In the Bedroom is a tonic."
0,Fresh,"The total mix adds up to a kind and heartwarming movie about human relationships, and ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" should provide a nice escape for audiences weary of our conflicted social media driven culture."
1,Rotten,This was an awful movie.
0,Fresh,"There's nothing special or remarkable, but it's amiable and entertaining enough to make you forget that it's directed by the same man who brought the world Town And Country."
0,Fresh,"[Dylan's] bare-bones approach may trip up along the way, but it keeps the funny stuff in the foreground."
0,Fresh,"[The film has] swirling color, the excitement of samba and the accessible joy of a fabled city, not to mention a charming Orpheus in the young Brazilian Breno Mello, and a dazzling Eurydice in the American-born dancer and actress Marpessa Dawn."
0,Fresh,"The old alchemist's trick of turning lead into gold has nothing on The Disaster Artist, a film that masters the trickier feat of transforming trash into art."
1,Rotten,"The discipline is remarkable. But this constipated drama, set in a blue-collar corner of Los Angeles, imparts none of the sweat-shop magic."
0,Fresh,"Wes Craven takes off with taut, tense thriller - buckle up for a turbulent flight!"
1,Rotten,"I wanted ""The Butterfly Effect"" to end long before the completion of its near two-hour run time."
1,Rotten,"It made me feel unclean, and I'm the guy who liked There's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies. Oh, and Booty Call."
0,Fresh,"...a rich, thought-provoking continuation that benefits from the passage of time."
0,Fresh,"It features the finest, and most unique, performance by Anthony Hopkins in years and will leave you smiling long after you leave the theatre."
1,Rotten,"Branagh's contemporary American accent is annoying, and the film's constant inter-cutting of past and present lives becomes laughable."
0,Fresh,"Here is a children's film made for the world we should live in, rather than the one we occupy."
0,Fresh,Jessica Chastain is bulletproof in a frothy soap opera about the other women in Washington.
1,Rotten,"The sequel is just as overlong, filled with gay jokes, gay panic, racial slurs, Keystone Kops humor, ethnic pride, self-satisfied dialogue, and misguided biblical references."
1,Rotten,"Desert Flower is just like Pretty Woman, if Pretty Woman were also about genital mutilation in Somalia (which I believe it originally was)."
1,Rotten,"...the story is so ludicrous, defying rational human behavior, that it doesn't measure up to the wonderful performances."
0,Fresh,"A sad, touching and subtle film."
0,Fresh,"As absurd as it is stupid, Independence Day: Resurgence is a movie that will go down as a reviled and needless. But it's also goofy and has the sense of a small, petulant child banging his toys together in a sandbox, which is amusing."
1,Rotten,"I get so aggravated when a movie has a fabulous cast, then turns out to be a dud."
1,Rotten,Non Stop doesn't know how to hit it and quit; it's a rock doc that screams loud and says frustratingly little.
0,Fresh,"There's nothing special about Carrie Pilby... It's pleasant enough viewing though, and adds a few nice touches that subvert gender expectations."
0,Fresh,"Almost a model of what's best in American independent cinema... provocative but not exploitative, moving but not maudlin."
1,Rotten,The structure is a mess. The characters are plastic. And the lines are Seventies sitcom bad.
0,Fresh,"A thriller that does not cover tremendously new territory, nor does it have a lot of substance, but it is well made and exciting."
0,Fresh,"Stands as a worthy enough follow-up, but just a notch less successful...lacks the faultless pacing and focused storytelling of the original."
1,Rotten,"If the material used to fill in the formula could capitalize on the stars' charisma, the proceedings might be less cringe-worthy. Instead, Witherspoon and Vergara simply yell at each other."
1,Rotten,Not one of Disney's better animated efforts; it lacks the majesty of earlier works.
0,Fresh,A comedy classic unlikely to ever age
1,Rotten,"Too much a student of the Gus Van Sant school of minimalist filmmaking - think ""Gerry"" - Julia Loktev manages a travelogue romantic drama that is overwrought and yet undercooked."
1,Rotten,This softcore thriller runs strictly by the numbers.
1,Rotten,"[All] the good work is undone in the end. [It] implodes in the worst possible way, with a mix of grandstanding and wish fulfilment that renders Guilty unrealistic and illogical."
0,Fresh,"Reminiscent in tone and execution of a well-worn Agatha Christie novel, as it should be."
0,Fresh,"As ever, Payne -- adapting a novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings -- walks a fine line between caricature and compassion."
1,Rotten,Ryan Reynolds' most heroic feat in this effects-laden comic book adaptation is saving it from being a complete dud.
0,Fresh,"Between this film and John Grisham's The Rainmaker, Damon surfaces as one swell addition to the front line of screen actors."
0,Fresh,"Though not as good as the first or second chapters, it's still a playful, self-reflexive fable with vivid characters and references to pop culture."
0,Fresh,"Chapman and McKay deserve salute for their work as leads. Through their weary eyes and baby faces, the duo project the horrors of their Homeric journey and inspiring sacrifice."
1,Rotten,"The film bounces between the relationship's winning uplslope and its mopey descent, and the intercutting eventually kills the momentum, even though the film's rousing final minute reclaims some of the early spunk."
0,Fresh,"A competent improvement over the original Pet Sematary, if disappointingly still lacking in atmosphere and a consistent tonality."
1,Rotten,Lock up this humorless buddy comedy and throw away the key Read more: 'Cop Out': Lock up this humorless buddy comedy and throw away the key.
0,Fresh,"""Tuscaloosa"" is a sneakily ambitious first film that sometimes hits its mark."
1,Rotten,"The Change-Up is the Human Centipede of gag-me comedies, in which a doting father gets a Hershey squirt in his mouth from an infant in the first scene... It's a carpet bombing of bad taste, getting less funny with each passing moment, or gas."
0,Fresh,"A gorgeous, touching, and mesmerizing experience as confounding as death itself."
1,Rotten,"Halloween III, while not a complete success, at least offers something different from the norm."
1,Rotten,Donahue and Spiro should've spent more time exploring the human moments and much less time browbeating us with stuff we already know.
1,Rotten,"Whenever Robbie isn't dancing around, the movie feels as heavy and relentless as a Mack truck."
1,Rotten,"There is a dark but funny, likable but truthful movie that could be made from this material, maybe even with the same cast. But best efforts or not, The Dilemma isn't quite it."
0,Fresh,"Mercifully, it lacks the pretentious moralising of [Chaplin's] later work, and is far more professionally put together."
1,Rotten,"Mr. Holmes just about gets the job done thanks to McKellen and Parker, but too many mediocre elements ensure this affair is a sad waste of a strong concept."

1,Rotten,The sort of comic frippery that's wearing thin with age and repetition.
1,Rotten,"There is no depth to the piece and, while it might be asking too much of any film to show the ""real"" Jobs, it barely hints at the complexity of his ambitions and emotions."
0,Fresh,"An unwavering, barbaric picture that depicts both the futility of war with the brutality of it, in a bold, intrepid manner."

0,Fresh,"""Smashed"" does in 82 minutes what Robert Zemeckis' ""Flight"" took more than two hours to do - and does it better, without a spectacular computer-animated plane crash."
1,Rotten,"One of those movies that sits in an armchair, smokes a pipe and reflects ""seriously"" on ""the question of violence,"" but the main reason to see it is for the hilariously nasty uses it devises for a bear trap, nail gun, etc."
0,Fresh,"It's a movie with problems, but it also leaves you feeling somewhat inspired, and reminds you that sometimes, still, people can come together and make the world a slightly better place."
0,Fresh,Junger and Hetherington don't try to put the war or the troops' combat operations into context. They simply record what they and the soldiers experience. It's a brilliant strategy.
0,Fresh,"A grim, uncompromising--and revelatory--film. It's an incredibly difficult picture to watch. But its toughness brings equally incredible rewards."
0,Fresh,Grace Kelly reaches out into the audience for murder scissors; foreground tea tables all but clonk your knees; a tell-tale door key - how many Hitchcock revelation moments feature those! - is brandished inches from your nose.
0,Fresh,"The Sessions, a candid, gentle film about a paralyzed man's quest to have sex, walks a tricky, balanced, grave and funny path that's all its own."
0,Fresh,"Despite its flaws, Jeanne Labrune's Special Treatment is surprisingly atmospheric at times."
1,Rotten,"The songs are shrill and cloying (if mercifully forgettable), the choreography is embarrassing, and the comedy sets a new global standard for puerility -- and not in a fun way."
1,Rotten,"""47 Ronin"" would have been more fun if it kept swinging its sword instead of falling on it."
0,Fresh,"A seductive, woeful meditation on phony efforts and the challenge of living for the moment."
0,Fresh,"A classic black comic strangling by the Coens, who leave no domestic discomfort behind. In fact, all this film contains is unease, making it a perfect itchy sweater film for those who enjoy their cinema on the suffocating side."
0,Fresh,"Zhao brings a documentarian's eye to his story, augmented with some striking photography making the most of the movie's picturesque Badlands geography."
0,Fresh,"Alain Delon is the coolest killer hit the screen, a film noir loner for the modern era, in Jean-Pierre Melville's austere 1967 French crime classic."
0,Fresh,"It's an impressive achievement: The film reveals things about each person's inner world, and how it looks to the other, without making us feel as if we're lost in a house of mirrors."
0,Fresh,"A brilliant, underrated comedy, featuring one of the more inspired comic screenplays in recent years. It established David O. Russell as a major voice in Hollywood."
1,Rotten,"Fans of the original stage play will most likely enjoy Stoppard's film version, but this treatment feels far less dynamic or lively."
0,Fresh,"Superman Returns is a thundering epic of Spielbergian proportions: colossal action, grandiose effects and a breathtaking story."
1,Rotten,"Although it's not the worst western ever made (The Terror of Tiny Town will forever hold that title), it is one of the most mediocre, falling prey to more cliches than you can shake a six-gun at."
1,Rotten,"By the time this ""Fantasy Island"" arrives at its gallingly stupid final twist, you'll be dying to go home."
1,Rotten,"The Upside is a movie so safe that it barely exists, like a pool so scared of people drowning that it aspires to little more depth than a wet spot on the ground."
1,Rotten,No one is conniving or desperate enough for the movie to become a decent melodrama. And the conversations are too stale to culminate in interesting romance.
0,Fresh,"""Dredd"" is non-stop action + excellent 3D effects peppering an above-average story."
0,Fresh,The humour is ace and it has a strong emotional backbone that moves you from laughing at the characters to laughing with them. Subtle and beautiful execution.
1,Rotten,"From the ostentatious costumes by designer Beatrix Aruna Pasztor (""Wonder Boys"") to the annoying male hairstyles that permeate every scene, ""Vanity Fair"" is a movie that depends on its overall visual effect to hypnotize audiences into overlooking the film"

1,Rotten,"Sigh. Really, Al Pacino? Really?"
0,Fresh,"Learning to Drive... is a satisfyingly grownup movie. Its stakes are gentle but real. Its characters behave decently yet feel strongly, and their parallel worlds are unfair if occasionally joyous."

0,Fresh,Mosh resurrects the big screen possibilities of a genre in pure visual terms.
0,Fresh,"In this film of the tragedy, the visual effects and underwater sequences are totally convincing, Wahlberg and Kurt Russell are terrific and John Malkovich is to be congratulated for bringing one of the story's main villains so memorably to life."
1,Rotten,Pelé's ambition and struggles seem superficial and the resolutions too simple.
0,Fresh,Originality isn't Fast Five's goal so much as distillation; Lin's aim is to make the ultimate version of a Fast and the Furious film and the third time appears to be the charm for him as director. Fast Five is the best of the series.

0,Fresh,"Even the movie's title, or rather the source of it, is a surprise."
1,Rotten,"Here's one thing that's rarely complained about in a review: The acting and dialogue in Oh Hell No! are not bad enough. Partially, this can be credited to less screen time for Tara Reid."
0,Fresh,"A subtle and substantial film and is elevated further by the lead performances, as well as the first-class support of Jada Pinkett Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows and Donald Sutherland."
1,Rotten,"Resonating with Rat Pack ring-a-ding-ding, it's a silly sequel but, considering star value alone, it should sell a lot of popcorn."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, it strays into unlikely melodrama and distracting eroticism."

0,Fresh,The time to catch Tony Jaa is now.
0,Fresh,A lush romantic drama that echoes with hero worship.
0,Fresh,"Foster and McKenzie spark the same chemistry through their combined acting talents, an achievement made more remarkable given how little dialogue there is."
1,Rotten,At times it's quite moving - Wayne Bartholomew breaks down on camera as he recalls his hardscrabble childhood - though Edward Norton's narration has all the nuance of an I-Speak-Your-Weight machine.
1,Rotten,"There is nothing tangible to hold onto, just a lot of sound and fury and bloodied-up gangsters."
0,Fresh,"Cruel Intentions is a crass, shocking, somehow delightful film that takes the teen movie of the late '90s and turns the sex, deceit, and offensiveness to 11."
0,Fresh,"A sensitive and soulful film, populated by characters recognizably weighed down by both circumstance and a greater, free-floating ambivalence."
1,Rotten,"By Jig's end, director Sue Bourne seems to have lost interest in all but two of her young subjects. In fairness, that's two more than I managed."
0,Fresh,"There is no better time for this film to be, even if its appeal would be mostly limited to band fans and sociologists."

0,Fresh,"Into the Arms of Strangers was produced with the help of the Holocaust Museum in Washington; it is a valuable, if necessarily fragmented, part of that institution's attempt to convey the enormity of what the Nazis did one life at a time."
0,Fresh,"One Hour Photo is genuinely scary. Not because Sy takes his obsession to insane levels, but because we all know sane people like him."
1,Rotten,"Patchy and strangely unengaging, The Golden Compass is impressive in scale but disappoints by its cluttered storytelling and lack of heart."
1,Rotten,Take me back to before I witnessed the train wreck that is Me Before You.
0,Fresh,"Star Trek Into Darkness is the most visually spectacular film in the franchise...Narratively, however, it's more problematic - its incessant references and cribs from predecessors are a disappointment."
0,Fresh,A feel-good people-pleaser that is less 'food porn' than Favreau career metaphor...

0,Fresh,"Thankfully, Ratatouille never relies on pop-culture references or crass satire to get laughs. It creates comedy on its own terms."

1,Rotten,"Perhaps the only redeeming factor is that both the President and the First Lady are devoted to their daughter. Otherwise, this film should be impeached."
0,Fresh,"Looking like a medieval Grizzly Adams channeling The Terminator, Stellan Skarsgard as Cedric is worth the price of admission alone."
1,Rotten,The film's dogged insistence in re-fighting the cultural wars of the '50s without shedding any new light on either side reduces nearly all the characters to shallow mouthpieces for predictable points of view.

1,Rotten,...a lame and transparent pseudo-amusing scarefest...has all the whimsy and cheeky movement of an overcrowded parking lot at Disneyland...a generic goose bump ride
0,Fresh,"A comedy but only if you like blood sports. A screenplay that positively bristles with ... well, bristles, it's as savage as Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf or Carnage"

1,Rotten,What happens when the worst tendencies of a poor screenplay are exaggerated by labored and unimaginative direction?
0,Fresh,I take it as proof that Saw is half a parody of serial-killer movies... that Elwes goes stark raving bonkers off-the-deep-end awful in the film's final moments.
1,Rotten,"Here's hoping the inevitable third installment brings Emily Blunt back into the fold, so we can at least look forward to a character whose moral compass is still in working order."
1,Rotten,It's a pointless race against time.
0,Fresh,A cut above its pretentious predecessors; the graphic set-pieces -- including an opening inspired by Poe's 'The Pit and the Pendulum' -- deliver the gory goods.

0,Fresh,"""The Guilt Trip"" is tripe, but it's tripe that knows its audience. Seriously, take your mother. It'll be a mitzvah."
0,Fresh,"But part of why ""Roman Israel"" is stumping some critics lies in how it so completely subverts liberal good guy movie conventions, and by destroying them makes that kind of hero feel human for a change."
0,Fresh,Sound of My Voice is haunting me. I find myself mulling over certain segments in way that has dug in some sort of uncomfortably luscious fashion under my skin and into the very marrow of my bones.
1,Rotten,"The decision to film the major set-pieces in extreme close-up was ill-advised, and these murky and incoherent bits are further crippled by obvious CGI as well as rapid-fire editing that recalls those Ginsu blades in action on late-night infomercials."
0,Fresh,"It's that it's the very powerful, very real love story of two men that gives Brokeback its quality and universality -- and scares the hell out of its detractors."
1,Rotten,"Is it a comedy or a thriller? The trailer left me unsure, and now, having seen the movie, I feel no better informed."
0,Fresh,"The party and the script both run too long -- getting a little sloppy toward the end -- but the laughs along the way are genuine, and Fey and Poehler sell their characters' arcs as the tender heart of this buddy comedy."

0,Fresh,Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark successfully executes a film for a new generation of horror lovers while giving fans of the book the nostalgia they crave.
1,Rotten,"It's Grint who grounds in reality, as best he can, Brock's directing debut...this conventional Britcom lightly hums along for a good stretch before running off the road."
0,Fresh,"A bad Christmas movie can give off all the warmth of a televised yule log, but David E. Talbert, the writer-director of ""Almost Christmas,"" has assembled a gifted cast and given them a chance to stretch out and play with their roles."

0,Fresh,"Is Walk Hard funny? Sure; very much so, in places. At least I think it is. It might just be the Date Movie talking."
0,Fresh,"Tom Holland cements his place as the best actor to portray Spider-Man in Far From Home. But as a whole, the movie - though a delight to watch - has trouble balancing Peter's character development with its quirky tone and less than exciting plot."

1,Rotten,"In every department, the new movie is a blander affair [than the first]."

0,Fresh,I found myself wanting to live inside each and every frame of this marvelous achievement.
1,Rotten,"Though much of the film's power is tamped down by the passive storytelling style, Dillane's performance as the adult Jakob is compelling, and Ayelet Zurer is beguiling as Jakob's late-in-life soul mate."
1,Rotten,Kenner has devoted himself to a revelation that isn't much of a revelation-that corporations obfuscate the full truth to protect their interests.
0,Fresh,It is a film suffused with compassion as it celebrates the inner strength and quiet defiance of individuals at the mercy of a world where a shared humanity becomes the first casualty when intolerance and hatred take hold.
1,Rotten,"The movie comes across as a not particularly compelling episode of ""House of Cards,"" and Wilson's Southern accent is equally unconvincing."
1,Rotten,"""Hector and the Search for Happiness"" has an undeniable strain of poverty tourism, mixed with the insulting belief that those who have nothing somehow hold the secret to life."
0,Fresh,"Mother! is able to shock us, but it also provides a full experience of the highest quality being visually compelling, even mesmerizing, and/or presents a unique, intriguing and complex story."
1,Rotten,"At the chewy, candy core of this assaulting, shrill, Skittles-hued headache is a well-meaning treatise on solidarity and female friendship."

0,Fresh,"This is simply a film that both kids and parents can enjoy together, which, according to the consensuses for other recent kids' films, hasn't happened for awhile, so my advice would be to take advantage of it"
0,Fresh,A wonderful family film about the greatest race horse who ever lived that gets out of the gate quickly and impresses with its big heart and idiosyncratic characters.
1,Rotten,"You can feel the movie's gears grinding throughout, first in the rote suspense mechanics and later in the ham-fisted religiosity (conveyed through an endless soundtrack of evangelistic talk radio)."
0,Fresh,"A chewy, capable, mainstream flick which accommodates both those suffering from zombie fatigue and those who can't get enough."
0,Fresh,Whedon is on to a winning formula.
1,Rotten,"Dark Phoenix was made with the absolute minimum of care, from the bored performances to the lazily applied subtext to the movie's total lack of fun. It is less a whimper, and more of a death rattle."
0,Fresh,"A richly appointed period piece, it features kingly tantrums, mistresses, bodices, roaring fireplaces, incest, and mutton. It also features sharply enunciated, period-perfect dialogue in which nary a contraction can be heard."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the film is insultingly soft in its portrayal of neurological disorders, linking the disease to Phoebe's fanciful conversations with characters from Alice in Wonderland."
1,Rotten,Beneath all the forced hilarity lies an awful fear of aging - and Sandler is only 43! This is gonna be rough.
1,Rotten,"As the film moves from one musical performance to another, the result increasingly feels like a series of celebrity impersonations set to a best-of-punk compilation album."
0,Fresh,"...has a great sense of time and place, and, most appropriately for a film about art, the cinematography is exquisitely painterly."
1,Rotten,"In all, The Spy Next Door won't be regarded as anything but a minor effort in Chan's stateside repertoire, though its better moments should go a long way toward winning the ageless Chan a new audience of adoring youngsters."
1,Rotten,"""Trouble"" is second-rate Eastwood, existing in a parallel universe where the celebrity has been reduced to a Hallmark movie-of-the-week actor, not one of the most respected directors in Hollywood."
0,Fresh,"When the aim is pure visual spectacle, the results are brilliantly exciting. When the aim is heart-touching drama, though, the movie falls apart."
0,Fresh,"It tackles subject matter that seldom finds its way to the big screen and does it thoughtfully. It's not what I expected to see, but it's just maybe something I needed to see."
0,Fresh,"The movie and its themes have held up. For better or worse, we're a nation consumed by television, a country roped in by spectacle. Weir sees through it."

1,Rotten,"Light, glib and easy to forget."
1,Rotten,"But where before the duo were able to set the screen ablaze with sexy passion and old-fashioned double-dealing noir intrigue, this time they're stuck playing with a paint-by-numbers water color set."

1,Rotten,The Hole in the Ground shows a promising talent finessing the notes of his song without formulating it into plausible music.
0,Fresh,"When all the puzzle-like pieces come together, the movie's characters, story, score and emotions soar. The pace of that progress may feel slow, but things never get too quiet. It's a movie with a racing pulse, and you can feel its heart in every frame."
0,Fresh,A suspenseful and compelling film that's all the more powerful because it doesn't shy away from contemporary anti-Semitism in France.
0,Fresh,"Great acting throughout the cast, raw energy and poignant imagery are surely what secured Fish Tank the jury prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival."

1,Rotten,"The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter, like so many other Netflix movies, feels like a first draft that still could use some more punching up and focus."
0,Fresh,"The film's sheer boldness -- [director Jessica] Yu uses puppets, and the work of 5th Century B.C. Greek dramatist Euripides to illustrate the timelessness of her subjects' dilemmas -- should make it a must-see among doc fans and artfilm cinephiles."
0,Fresh,If [Crowe's] performance wasn't as strong as it is then The Water Diviner simply wouldn't work at all and it would be harder to forgive some of his less impressive directorial judgements.

0,Fresh,A textured drama about a musical family complete with richly realized characters and a pleasing soundtrack for all generations.
0,Fresh,"Curtis is nicely matched by Greer, who's always nothing short of wonderful, and Matichak to form a trio of take-no-prisoners women. Their three generations of scream-queen perfection is what ultimately gives this ""Halloween"" a fighting spirit of its own"
1,Rotten,"While the film has an undeniably sexy glow, it's too earnest and sappy by half."
0,Fresh,"It's simply stunning to watch, but what makes The Martian so memorable and such a captivating theatrical experience are the characters at the heart of the film."
0,Fresh,Renée Zellweger's performance as Judy Garland will go down as a career highlight.
1,Rotten,"It was a sitcom, which is to say habitual - and since it is still frequently broadcast and enjoyed, it is with us as much as it ever was. And we don't enjoy our favourite habits being changed for us."
0,Fresh,"It may not be perfect, but what sibling relationship ever is?!"
1,Rotten,Uncle Buck attempts to tell a heart-warming story through a series of uncomfortable and unpleasant scenes; it's a tug-of-war between its ambitions and its methods.
0,Fresh,"Despite the film's claim to be an anatomy of a pop culture craze, it's deeply parochial and has an opportunistic feel at its core."
0,Fresh,This is the funniest movie of the summer.
0,Fresh,"Glorious vision of youth and truth, love and loss, your name is Mud."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, Alter's often inventive work is kneecapped by a deliriously nonsensical script, which misses the mark as both over-the-top parody and straight-faced homage, and could have been intended as either."
0,Fresh,Always interesting and informative...
0,Fresh,"A visual and emotional kaleidoscope, which draws on the language of comics and is based on a multireferencial script, full of action, formidable humor and timely comments on plurality. [Full Review in Spanish]"

1,Rotten,"If you want to know how inept the movie is...well, it's so inept that you may wish you were watching an M. Night Shyamalan version of the very same premise."
0,Fresh,The Company Men does a very fine job stressing the financial and personal abyss that can confront somebody whose year of devotion to a company can result in little more than hand shake.
0,Fresh,"At least here's a movie with scope, for God's sake."
1,Rotten,Should appeal to blase high schoolers who enjoyed Cruel Intentions and crave a stronger tragicomedy of bad manners.
0,Fresh,"In its workmanship it aspires not to be remarkable but to be well made, dependable, moving us because of the hurt in the hero's eyes."
0,Fresh,"It is far too long and the romance is half-hearted. Still, you'd have to travel very far to feel so fully immersed in another world."
1,Rotten,There is a good reason most music documentaries focus on bands rather than the brains behind them.
1,Rotten,"Stone starts interesting, gets better, and then simply sits there until it ends with a whimper instead of a much-needed bang."

1,Rotten,"While one might applaud its intent, Carnal Knowledge succeeds only in being self-righteous and dull."
1,Rotten,"""Dredd"" is a lot of murk and grunt with no inner engine. And the unnecessary 3-D only makes it look muddier."
0,Fresh,A profoundly sweet take on girls growing into women.
1,Rotten,An undercharged as well as under-dressed affair that can't ever quite overcome its own cumbersome screenplay.
0,Fresh,"The performances are pitch-perfect: Eckhart, swallowing words he knows will only lead to an argument and averting his eyes as if she will be able to see them there; Kidman, guarded and still, wearing her vulnerability like armor."
1,Rotten,The film never really regains the opening scene's momentum.
0,Fresh,"David Mackenzie's modern-day Western hits the high-water mark in terms of its uniformly fine performances if not, necessarily, its narrative construct."
0,Fresh,"It has sometimes been suggested that there's little more to be said, in cinematic terms, [about the Holocaust].... The single-minded power and visceral immediacy of Nemes's achievement, rightly acclaimed and awarded, prove otherwise."
0,Fresh,"As a continuation of the risk-taking Thanos saga, the feature isn't quite as daring as expected."
1,Rotten,"Siphoning out the fistfights and exploding spaceships from its two-hour running time would leave about 30 minutes of plot, a sign that this story is essentially an overcomplicated TV episode rather than a movie."
0,Fresh,"It's just what happens when Americans make movies about the Civil War: They fall over themselves to make it feel holy, definitive, important, something akin to religion."

0,Fresh,"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is absolutely brilliant. It might not be what you expect, but any movie that can make you laugh that hard at pure violence, deserves an award."
0,Fresh,"Franchise Fred approves Sharknado 5: Global Swarming. Theatrical movies should have this much fun, and take the absurd this seriously."

0,Fresh,Stuber is funny enough to overcome some of the bumps on the road and reach its destination safely
0,Fresh,"Noomi Rapace becomes a bonafide action star in the Netflix thriller, Close. She shoots, stabs, and pummels bad guys like an estrogen version of Jason Bourne."
1,Rotten,Only several charismatic actors and fleeting moments of genuine romance survive this modern thrashing of the age-old fairy tale.
0,Fresh,"What grounds the spectacle, pushing it beyond a two-hour ejaculation of sensation, is its yearning for innocence"
0,Fresh,"The creative team had a unified vision, the talent on screen was strong, and the creator's vision was honored. If only audiences had responded in kind."
1,Rotten,"The film is full of known places and familiar situations, it's predictable and sadly becomes an involuntary comedy that will make you laugh non stop. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"Around about here, Pattinson gets to bare his own chest -- a bad idea in a movie that also features Taylor Lautner- and we notice that while his face is heavily pancaked, his torso is of a normal human hue. Whatever, I suppose."
1,Rotten,"Not very likely to seize that Potter market, this is a disappointing film that starts out okay but goes rapidly downhill, thanks to rudimentary characterisation and storytelling that's designed more to accommodate gratuitous action."
0,Fresh,"Blending Jennifer Westfeldt's talky, observational style with the kind of irreverent humour that helped Bridesmaids bridge the gender divide, Friends With Kids explores love, marriage and child-rearing with gusto and wit."
0,Fresh,A playful trifle that feels so much like a genial knockoff of Get Shorty that it might as well be called Get Shorter.
1,Rotten,The Dinner is a curiously bland adaptation of Herman Koch's bestseller about two couples dining out at an outrageously expensive restaurant while discussing some nasty business done by their children.

0,Fresh,Lesson of kindness permeates inspiring true story.
1,Rotten,"Doesn't have the depth or emotional resonance of a picture such as The Big Chill, mainly because we never feel for the characters."
0,Fresh,"The atmosphere of secrets and betrayal among the power elite is thrilling because Alfredson never overplays it. ""Tinker"" is a cool-and-calm movie about cool-and-calm characters who are frantic beneath the surface."
0,Fresh,"The Valley gets at the angst of high tech with an almost burning acuteness, with the constant work and the price of it as alienation at home."
0,Fresh,"We get far too few opportunities in the U.S. to see Hou's gorgeous films on the big screen. If this one comes to your town, don't pass it up."

1,Rotten,"Como obra de arte, este projeto falha grosseiramente (e vai despertar a revolta de muitos espectadores). J como exerccio cinematogrfico, merece um pouco mais de ateno."
1,Rotten,"The latest from Tim Burton would seem tailor-made for his tastes but it's a convoluted slog, dense in mythology and explanatory dialogue but woefully lacking in thrills."
0,Fresh,An eye-poppingly vivid exercise in genre-busting filmmaking. Here is one of the most persistently intriguing directors of the 1960s at his most watchable and entertaining.
0,Fresh,"A hysterical nightmare of repressed sexuality and gender identity, it is arguably De Palma's masterpiece, but certainly a film you won't forget."

0,Fresh,Padilha's remake has some ideas to explore but he never embraces the broad theatricality necessary to make them spectacular entertainment.
1,Rotten,"Butler doesn't even have his own catchphrase. He just poaches two of Schwarzenegger's, bellowing both ""Get to the chopper!"" and ""I'll be back!"""
0,Fresh,A great movie to watch now and see how a struggle gets conducted.
1,Rotten,"As a contemporary fantasy, it is more holiday filler than summer magic, but the cast does its best to bring all the clichs to life."

1,Rotten,"Damned if you do, B-List character actor if you don't."
0,Fresh,"A fine middlebrow addition to the end-of-year sweepstakes, as good as expected, as bad as feared, and gone without a ripple."
0,Fresh,"That approach is what makes Disobedience feel so fresh. Whereas most modern ""off the derech,"" stories focus on Jews struggling to acclimate to their new lives, this film instead takes a look at what happens when you try to fit back into your old one."
1,Rotten,"For a film about erotomania, Prom Night is a curiously flaccid affair."
1,Rotten,"This is arguably Ray's least distinguished film, a relatively conventional, anonymous WWII drama made for RKO mogul Howard Hughes."

0,Fresh,"There is a good bit of humor in the movie and the performances of Cruise and Blunt are spot on, with good supporting work from Bill Paxton, who plays a very hard-headed sergeant."
1,Rotten,"Too ambitious and valiantly conceived to write off completely, but it's missing an all-important beating heart at its center."
1,Rotten,"It's tolerably entertaining while the characters are in motion and Griffith is blasting the bad guys, but it grinds to a rusty halt whenever she feigns emotion."

0,Fresh,"As indebted to the previous installments and ""Star Wars"" canon as it is to classic Westerns, sword-and-sandal epics and martial arts films.... it's the blend of reverence for its roots and embrace of the new that makes ""The Last Jedi"" a triumph."

0,Fresh,"Exciting, witty and action-packed, this is one of the best MI films. I'd say it was mission accomplished."
1,Rotten,"Texas Rangers is a generic, gun-toting fable -- a dull, laughable cactus costume drama that has no significant appeal to it other than to boast the empty machismo antics of its leads."
1,Rotten,"While In the Heart of the Sea has the potential to impress, it remains a flawed vessel which struggles to rise above its theatrical artifice."
1,Rotten,"The Spiderwick Chronicles, while not without its virtues (including a genuinely sweet ending), goes too far on the frightening front, especially for a young audience."
1,Rotten,Athletic dancing and a patriotic theme make this movie better than it should be.
1,Rotten,"The feature debut of writer-director Randy Moore has a juicy cultural totem in its sights, the Disney empire, but it misses more than it hits."
1,Rotten,"No doubt Asian capitalist interests are well-served in the end, there won't be rioting in the streets on the back of this one. A film is hardly effective satire if it doesn't point up a route to radical change."
0,Fresh,"A charming, well-crafted trifle - at least until the subversive last act, when it sets its sights a bit higher."
0,Fresh,"Overall, 'District 9' is a uniquely moving, heartfelt and provocative drama that stays with you after you've left the theater."
1,Rotten,"Science fiction movies don't come much more ponderous than the beautifully filmed Never Let Me Go, which reduces the debate over genetic engineering to a mild, moist romantic soap opera."

1,Rotten,It's not as exciting as it should be but picks up towards the end and Ed Harris is fun as a property tycoon nasty.
1,Rotten,"It's not a convincing family drama or rise-and-fall story, the redemption is forced, the plot twists are painfully obvious, its sluggish and preachy, offers no real insight into the current financial collapse, and worst of all--it's dreadfully boring."
1,Rotten,Probably the worst of the Critters series (and that's saying something).
0,Fresh,"Consciously avoiding a Dreamgirls vibe that suggests their failure was a showbiz tragedy, Neville lets his subjects unabashedly strut their stuff."
0,Fresh,"A film of real finesse, style and intelligence, an espionage thriller of the old school, with some modern technical embellishments."
0,Fresh,"Twist open the Ouzo! It's time to let your hair down - Greek style. A vibrant whirlwind of love, family and all that goes with it, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth, colour and cringe."
1,Rotten,"'Overall, what more can you say about this two-bit meandering and empty-headed carousing crime comedy? Bottom line: everyone connected with this project ought to be handcuffed to the door handle of a speedy out-of-control police cruiser.'"
0,Fresh,While we brace ourselves for the next bout of violence our minds are contextualizing the plot to parse it as necessary rather than nonsense.
1,Rotten,"The rags-to-riches plot should keep hopeless romantics happy, but you just can't help wondering what Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock and a team of decent joke writers might have achieved with this one."
0,Fresh,"As manipulative and often corny as Miracles is, it's a fantastic true story whose bedrock emotions continually connect thanks to director Patricia Riggen and an inspired cast led by a never better Garner."
1,Rotten,The overall result isn't drama as much as it is a dissertation.
0,Fresh,"Overall, this is a fun movie in a fun series. They definitely left the door open for a fourth movie and I'll definitely go see it when it comes out."
1,Rotten,Much of At Any Price and 99 Homes play like bad Arthur Miller.
1,Rotten,"Too hidebound to the original, never quite evolving an identity or mood of its own while attempts to ""modernise"" the tale feel a touch too forced and become a little grating."
0,Fresh,It's altogether a tearful experience - as contemplating such irrecoverable losses to a whole generation should be.
1,Rotten,"The movie strains far too hard to make what Rachel and Dex have done all right, as if their guilty anguish - and the movie's saccharine score - frees us to root for them."
0,Fresh,"Saraband is a great masterpiece, and a true and fitting culmination to a major career."
1,Rotten,"The first hour is given to aimless glimpses of aimless existences, and the second, in which Colin finds a sort of deliverance, is contrived in concept and awkward in execution."
0,Fresh,You'll discuss the pros and cons of the tech later - there's ample arguments for both -- but odds are you'll be having too much fun to worry about it during the movie itself.

1,Rotten,A movie that is not just muddled in the conventional ways but down to its core.
1,Rotten,"Step into the darkened theater and the familiar smell may not hit you immediately. Watch your step, though, because A Dog of Flanders is nothing but cinematic doggy poo."
1,Rotten,"While Goldthwait's heart is in the right place, it's unlikely the blood spilled in his film will make annoying, loathsome people finally straighten ... up."

1,Rotten,"The actresses are dynamite, Kendrick in particular, each lighting up the screen with a ferocious glee that's inspiring. But gosh did I find a lot of this tiresome."
0,Fresh,It's no coincidence that the Second Life-style virtual universe thrown into turmoil in Summer Wars goes by the name of Oz. This spectacular anime entry from Mamoru Hosoda echoes that 1939 classic.
0,Fresh,"Taking place over the course of two hopeless days, Walker's performance is truly special."
1,Rotten,The need to separate from the first film seems to have sliced most of Identity's considerable charm right off the bone of what could have been (and still could be) an interesting franchise.

0,Fresh,"This strange premise (and a hefty running time) demands a huge leap of faith from viewers. For those up to making the jump, a moving and rather mind-bending experience awaits."
0,Fresh,"It's an enjoyable work of its own, less hyper stylized, with certain changes that make it more viciously pulpy and, surprisingly, seedier."
0,Fresh,"Overall, I recommend the film, you may or may not find it a bit dry."
0,Fresh,"But for fans of the auteur able to separate his personal life from his cinematic one, and for others open to old-school suspense where no one gets away clean and failure truly is an option, this political whirligig delivers the goods."
1,Rotten,In a word; awful.
1,Rotten,Drunk on its perfume-ad cinematography and doesn't know when to quit with its double-double cross plotting.
0,Fresh,"The hills are alive with the sound of rock and roll, and the people of Laurel Canyon are learning new songs to live by."

0,Fresh,Has a few sparkling moments that are irresistible.
0,Fresh,A big dumb lug of an action movie and possibly the best of the summer. It is certainly the best that doesn't involve a spaceship or a wizard. Enjoy the ride.
0,Fresh,Fiercely personal and unique.
0,Fresh,"The rip-roaring special effects serve little purpose, other than to attempt to obscure a narrative so moronic that it's not only offensive to Carroll fans, but confusing to anyone, Alice aficionado or not."

0,Fresh,So-so comedy with Keaton still straining to keep up with her post-Woody Allen career.
0,Fresh,Smith and Mendes are terrific together. He brings her game up so high you'd think she has had as many good parts as Smith.
0,Fresh,"Nell and Eva's relationship forms the heart of the film and, along with the fleeting moments of ecstasy they find in things previously taken for granted, their bond provides something of genuine beauty in a progressively bleak world."
0,Fresh,Junk food for cineastes.

0,Fresh,Boy will it chill your blood.
1,Rotten,"Big chunks of the film are devoted to the idea that it's hilarious to watch guys in fancy costumes bicker and play volleyball, but that sort of thing is amusing for about a minute."
1,Rotten,"A leaden attempt at an upbeat romp from the downcast, feel-bad tag team of actor Russell Crowe and director Ridley Scott, the movie is like hearing a knock-knock joke told by a mortician."
0,Fresh,"Dunstan directs his first feature with a good eye, but the material doesn't feel as realistic as the duo might have hoped."
1,Rotten,"In the department of numbing ineptitude, the pacing runs a neck-and-neck race with the dialogue."

1,Rotten,"Anna just isn't quite the fun thrill ride that one might have hoped for. Basically, if you're on the hunt for an interesting, inventive spy thriller, keep looking."
1,Rotten,"Yeah, they're keeping it real. Real stupid."
0,Fresh,Prescriptive eco docs are rarely as attuned to the folly of human ingenuity as this one or as insightful on our knee-jerk demand for impossibly easy solutions.
1,Rotten,"The dark, concrete corridors of the maze provide the venue for one exciting action sequence, but beyond these superficial thrills, there's little emotional weight to the film."
0,Fresh,"This drama feels a little contrived due to the sheer number of issues faced by one family over a short period of time. But it's so refreshingly well-acted, with lively characters and some fairly outrageous situations, that it keeps us fully engaged."
1,Rotten,"Frustrating, confusing, loud, and offensive."
0,Fresh,"You'll laugh, and then hate yourself for laughing."
1,Rotten,"Red Joan's romantic representation of its central character's early life is at odds with Dench's powerful, unvarnished performance."

0,Fresh,An astute and deliciously engrossing film.

1,Rotten,Nothing but a series of repetitive gunfights and bad conversations.
1,Rotten,"The whole fiasco turns out to be an excuse to let Seth Green play a (redubbed) little boy. Next time, maybe just cast a real boy, build some sets in an old barn, and have Mom make the costumes. [Blu-ray 3D]"
0,Fresh,"Rabbit Hole is a searing drama that, despite its bleak theme, bravely posits how even the deepest emotional abyss need not become a prison of depression and hopelessness."
1,Rotten,"Yes, Terrence Howard delivers another solid lead performance and competition swimming is a new arena for such films. Nonetheless, Pride is just plain trite."
1,Rotten,"The concept is lame, and the execution is lame, too. The more the film advances, the less we care about the plot - or anything that happens to anybody, really."
1,Rotten,What could and should have been a deep-felt rumination on aging ... is never more thoughtful than half-hour television.
0,Fresh,"Start with an absurdity, a clinic where memories are erased, then try to conceive of the logical consequences. Then take same and create a romance. Voila!!!"
0,Fresh,"...an old-fashioned, irresistibly earnest piece of work..."
0,Fresh,"Sachs's preoccupation with real estate may be a trifle bourgeois, but the films that result are finely tooled little gems."
0,Fresh,"The more it tries to be smart, the more disappointing it is whenever it scampers back to rom-com convention."
1,Rotten,One to avoid.
1,Rotten,"Assassin's Creed is many things, and none of them good. Visually, it's the ugliest movie of 2016 -- and keep in mind that I saw Robert De Niro's prosthetic penis in Dirty Grandpa."
1,Rotten,"If the adults in My Sister's Keeper are repeatedly compromised in the honesty department, the children seem to embody truth physically."
1,Rotten,Everyone in the film looks as if they're doing penance.
0,Fresh,Flawed but skin-crawling feature from Matthew Holness.
1,Rotten,There's almost enough in-joke ingenuity to justify the total absence of plot.
0,Fresh,"Watching and laughing at the film, you'd never know it was such a troubled production. Here's to you, Mr. Reiner."
1,Rotten,"It suffers, too, from what plagues the big, brawny action engines: The mechanics of the generic thrills and spills override the logic of the narrative."
0,Fresh,"Venom is a narrative nightmare in which every scene feels rushed. And yet, by the power of slimy black tentacles, possessed dogs and children, and Hardy's fearless lunacy, it is a wickedly watchable experience."
1,Rotten,"Without the benefit of Hardy's prose, the point of the movie is lost in the grim, grayish ether."
0,Fresh,"A pleasant, funny, utterly predictable film that won't hurt you to watch but won't hurt you to miss, either."
1,Rotten,"While Septic Man might sound on paper like a little gem that Troma might have made, it is rather slow moving fare with much rambling around in dark sewers calling out for aid rather than traditional horror fare."
0,Fresh,"Succeeds as a comedy, as a glimpse at a tumultuous time in European history, and as a thoughtful look at the great lengths to which people will go for important relationships."
0,Fresh,"There's editorial slackness here that Scorsese hasn't displayed in years, lost in a tornado of actor tics and improvisations that transform sections of movie into Apatowian indecision."
1,Rotten,"In trying to be daring and original, it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh."
0,Fresh,"Not a lot of attention is paid to the troubling implications of living your life in a make-believe space, but the adventure moves fast enough to prevent the viewer from worrying too much about it."
0,Fresh,"In ways, it's more effective than even Spielberg's Schindler's List... Polanski's work is more of a personal and therapeutic experience for him, going back to his Polish roots in the midst of the horror that he and his family witnessed firsthand."
1,Rotten,"Men, Women, & Children curates the world of technology into a tiny sliver of only the most outlandishly evil elements, and pretends that perspective is reason for despair."
1,Rotten,"Those first two thirds aren't just sluggish--they lack, for Yimou, soul."
1,Rotten,"Ghost in the Shell is a stupefying failure that's close to unforgivable, its apparent inability to understand what it gets wrong and why a perplexing mystery even Major herself wouldn't be able to solve."
0,Fresh,What the film lacks in narrative and visual subtlety it more than makes up for in rich human interaction.
0,Fresh,It doesn't skimp on cool pretzel moves.
0,Fresh,"So long as there are men in power who are still fuzzy on the definition of rape, Rosemary's Baby will endure as a cautionary tale."
0,Fresh,"Clement is funny and touching as the heartbroken artist, and he and Hall have a sparkling chemistry."
0,Fresh,"Though Moore is on less solid ground when mulling vague solutions to economic woes, his message for the masses about this national 'robbery' in progress as their jobs, health care and homes go up in smoke, is loud and clear: You've been had."
0,Fresh,"The battle choreography is superb, and Woo's Peckinpah-style slo-mo violence ensures that every lopping and skewering gets our full attention. The film could do with some lopping itself - at least half an hour - but the effect is dizzyingly grand."
0,Fresh,The film overcomes the central miscasting of Samantha Morton.
1,Rotten,"You can almost see the summit, but the plot keeps getting in the way."
0,Fresh,"Not a movie filled with laughs, action or startling revelations but one that sticks in the memory and impresses with its subtlety."
0,Fresh,Benefits immeasurably from a menacing turn by Jack Palance.
0,Fresh,It's Romeo and Juliet retold in medieval rock n' roll style
1,Rotten,"Perhaps J. Edgar works against Eastwood's finest gift as a filmmaker, his instinct for intimate details that in this case don't matter. Maybe a director who isn't as one-take efficient would better notice the flaws as they unfold and accumulate."
1,Rotten,The dialogue is almost as loud as the exhausts; and the bits of detail aren't enough in a movie that teens may find delivers an unpalatable message -- daddy knows best.
0,Fresh,A triumph.
0,Fresh,Imperium is a stark character drama that's more disconcerting for its subject matter than its actual storytelling.
1,Rotten,"The tale of a guy who's just a victim of being a jerk, coping with the horrible curse of being good-looking."

0,Fresh,"It's such a lavish, awesome spectacle!"
1,Rotten,Ugh! Ah! Make it stop!!!
0,Fresh,"The film comes over as a tour de force version of the disease-of-the-week TV movie: half scientific detective story, half domestic drama, replete with scenes of suffering."
0,Fresh,"It's brave work, and the role seems tailor-made for the actor, who's enjoyed an entire career playing easily winded jerks, with Willard's descent into authority and panic vividly captured."
1,Rotten,"As easy as this movie is to watch, it's artificially flavored."
1,Rotten,"The Spy Next Door is precisely what you would expect from a PG-rated Jackie Chan comedy with that plot. If that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed. It's not what I was looking for."
1,Rotten,"Its offbeat aesthetic largely flaunts for appeal, suffocating character and thematic ambition underneath its flashiness."
0,Fresh,"[Tatum moves] like a cut, super-charged Donald O'Connor. How his body works is one of our generation's greatest mysteries."
1,Rotten,J.C. Chandor turns an intensely physical narrative into another of his inadvertently generic studies of procedure.
0,Fresh,"It's a cliché to talk of artists as tortured, but McQueen's anguish is palpable."
0,Fresh,"Moana would be a positive addition to popular media, but in the current sociopolitical climate, it feels downright vital and indispensable."
0,Fresh,"Punctuated by dark comedy and occasional flights into the surreal, it's daring on a technical level, thought provoking and vastly entertaining."
0,Fresh,"He might be wearing chainmail, but he's no Iron Man. He might as well wear the tights and pointy shoes!"
0,Fresh,"From the interior of Binoche, is where the beautiful light comes from (whitish, like a beautiful autumn day) to which the title refers and which, at the same time, is what actually illuminates this charming film by Denis. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"The film isn't just earthy -- it is muddy and soiled. Arnold is fantastic at conveying a tactile world of rough edges - wood grain, bracken and rock - a gritty world inhabited by moths, beetles and watched over by hovering birds of prey.."
1,Rotten,"Swerve plays out like a down under version of No Country for Old Men, sapped of any sense of tension, logic or charm."
0,Fresh,"Above all, this film captures a romantic part of the imagination that is often left unexplored."
0,Fresh,"It's an ode to what it means to make a film with unbridled creativity, without limits and without concern for commercial calculation."
0,Fresh,"Plays more like a curious, sincere experiment of a promising new storyteller rather than the egotistical self-indulgence of an A-List actor."
1,Rotten,"If Frank Capra had ever made a Rambo movie, it would have looked like this."
1,Rotten,"Mad Money isn't completely rotten, but it's sour enough to leave an unpleasant aftertaste."
0,Fresh,"Because more time is dedicated to crafting authentic, sympathetic characters than the average horror movie, it's easier to overlook the film's often-corny dialogue and so-so special effects."
0,Fresh,Has enough charm and visual delights to compensate for its own storytelling shortcomings.
0,Fresh,"Then the lights went down, and guess what? Fifty Shades of Grey turned out to be not just entertaining-at least until the clunky, exasperating final minute-but it also knows exactly what it's doing."
0,Fresh,"Lacking momentum and a presence of an intimidating villain, Never Go Back doesn't know what it wants to be."
1,Rotten,'Peter Rabbit' is shrill and surprisingly violent - far from the atmosphere of the beloved Beatrix Potter books.
0,Fresh,"The movie is simply, stellar, an American parable and moving drama found in an unlikely place."
0,Fresh,The resulting movie is a very well assembled cinematic mediocrity.
0,Fresh,Overall it's a solidly told and intriguing piece of old-school sci-fi storytelling.
0,Fresh,It wants to treat war with the seriousness it deserves while sparing the audience of anything that might be disconcerting.

0,Fresh,Anyone who doesn't smile is probably either too adult to count or too dead to care.
1,Rotten,"Amusing though it sometimes is, the closest thing the movie offers to a reason for its existence is the post-Runaways success of Jett."
0,Fresh,"A rather humanist tone infuses ""East Side Sushi,"" offering a sense of hope as characters choose to come together rather than be pulled apart."
0,Fresh,"Brilliantly acted and photographed, yet strangely frustrating fable."
0,Fresh,Baumbach captures the ways in which children takes sides in a war they can't even begin to comprehend.
1,Rotten,A noteworthy cast is squandered in this woefully absurd redemption story.
1,Rotten,"Trainwreck starts off as a provocative and innovative comedy, but in the end it turns into yet another generic Rom-Com. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"In less-sure hands, this could have been a creepy debacle. But Heller, who first adapted the work for the stage, knows the material inside out, and with the Sundance Institute at her back, she has created an impeccably crafted film."
0,Fresh,"Tony, Tony, Tony. How can we miss you if you won't go away?"
0,Fresh,"The film is sweet. Its observations of life in the aftermath of death ring true, especially for anyone who's traveled the contours of mourning."
0,Fresh,The emotionally bruised air that's frequently made Kim Basinger tabloid fodder is also a defining characteristic of her acting style.
0,Fresh,"Amazingly, the film juggles all the elements well without being messy, instead playing fair and tying up all the loose ends."
1,Rotten,Crosses the finish line as nothing more than routine.
0,Fresh,"This film has it all, and the performances are beyond expectations. Cooper was already an excellent actor, but he has set a high bar for himself now as a director. And this will not be the last time you will see Lady Gaga acting in a lead role."
1,Rotten,The most boring comedy I have ever seen.
1,Rotten,"The sillier scenes of Bill Murray traipsing through a dangerous part of the world are fun, but when the story tries to get at something more serious, it falls apart pretty quickly."
0,Fresh,Cranston shows Trumbo's public and private sides - giving full measure to his eccentricities without devolving into caricature.
0,Fresh,Drive revels in sensory detail; it's a visually and aurally edgy Euro-influenced American genre movie about the coolness of noir-influenced American genre movies about the coolness of driving - especially in L.A.
1,Rotten,Movies like Deck the Halls should make us all thankful that Christmas only comes once a year. What other season could possibly inspire a story as insipid as this?
1,Rotten,"The choreography is sloppy and lifeless; the outmoded blend of vintage rock, country and Broadway styles doesn't click; and the characters are such caricatures that it's no wonder the entire cast is overacting."
0,Fresh,"Rich in emotional honesty and equal parts funny/moving, The Big Sick successfully infuses the traditional rom-com formula with a modern sensibility."
0,Fresh,"The film is so good-natured, so obviously aware of everything it's up to, even its own picturesque frauds, that I opt to go along with it."
0,Fresh,So overall it is an odd trippy little film but I enjoyed watching it.
0,Fresh,Adult Beginners is a darkly funny indie film about family and second chances.
1,Rotten,Jupiter Ascending is a very special kind of dumb.
0,Fresh,"An appropriately hard-boiled quality runs through the movie, and the cast (from top to bottom) brings its best, putting the frosting on this nasty bit of Layer Cake."
0,Fresh,"A movie with the structure of Adrift has to live and die by the quality/believability of both its action and setting, and right off the bat it's clear that both will be handled well."
1,Rotten,It's too bad that the events leading up to it are so ridiculous that they undermine what's otherwise a powerfully disquieting denouement.
1,Rotten,"After a million brewskies, Brewster's Millions is passable fare as a late-night viewing option, but those seeking genuine laughs would do well to look elsewhere."
0,Fresh,There is a manic energy that almost literally electrifies every scene [Gibson's] in.
1,Rotten,What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian.
0,Fresh,"While this one won't change your life, it will entertain you for a couple of hours."
0,Fresh,"[Gerwig's] first solo flight as a director and writer is beautifully confident in its rhythm and mood, the script whip-sawing from humor to earnest emotion to raw pain and back."
1,Rotten,"A golden comic premise, directed to dross by Ken Scott, who also made the Canadian original (""Starbuck,"" from 2011) on which this Vince Vaughn vehicle is based."
0,Fresh,"""A movie that believes it's more radical than it actually is."""
0,Fresh,"Those coming to Rescue Dawn cold will probably accept it as a straightforward, even predictable account of POW suffering, and they'll hang on Bale's muscular portrayal of a man who refuses to say die."
1,Rotten,genre pulp
0,Fresh,"A meaty, enjoyable adult movie especially if you still miss a regular visit to The West Wing."
0,Fresh,A sleek erotic mystery spiked with unexpected twists. Its plot switches are triggered with a smooth calculation that might have won the Hitchcock seal of approval.
0,Fresh,Drive is a stylish mainstream thriller infused with moody Scandinavian spirit.
0,Fresh,Overall this is a masterful piece of storytelling and a film which will rightly be regarded as a classic. Eastwood is on staggering form as an actor and equally inspiring as a director.
0,Fresh,"The oft-hilarious push-and-pull between director and subject-Williams wryly notes that the film is turning into ""the Steve and Paulie Show""-effectively hacks away at the celebrity-enthusiast divide."
0,Fresh,"You won't be hungry for seconds by the time the last baddie hits the floor, but you won't be checking your watch repeatedly, either."
0,Fresh,"The film carves out a rich emotional sphere concomitant to its stunning production design, finding delicate poetry in the dispassionate pursuit of revenge."
1,Rotten,This is 2004's first airball of goo.
0,Fresh,The Bogie and Lupino performances were razor sharp.
0,Fresh,"[Raimi's] matured quite a bit with Spider-Man, even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see."
1,Rotten,"I giggled, with a level of disbelief verging on awe, at the notion that people actually woke up each morning to shoot this movie thinking that they were engaged in an act of entertainment (or sanity)."
1,Rotten,"As enjoyable an actor as Brosnan is, sometimes his taste in screenplays boggles the mind."
1,Rotten,"Too cute for older kids, too bland for younger kids and too cute and too bland for the rest of us."
1,Rotten,"A dreary and depressing alleged comedy that takes a talented cast and a promising germ of an idea, and kills it dead."
0,Fresh,"You can't help but marvel, and laugh at, Ferrell's indefatigable enthusiasm and willingness to make a complete ass of himself."
0,Fresh,A semi autobiographical tale with elevated moments thanks to Sarandon's acting chops. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,Leave No Trace is further evidence Granik is one of the most talented directors around - and Ben Foster ranks among the finest and most intense actors working today.
1,Rotten,"Amenbar aims for a noirish X-Files vibe, but preposterousness rules this inert trudge that does absolutely no justice to a terrible real-life phenomenon."
1,Rotten,"Acting like a family sitcom contrived for a TV food channel, Tortilla Soup should have been released as a menu."
1,Rotten,Michael Knowles directs with all the complexity of a TV sitcom.
0,Fresh,"A wonderfully textured look at a very special time in music history, Andrew Slater's Echo In The Canyon is an exceptional journey into the music scene in and around LA's Laurel Canyon in the the mid-to-late 1960s."
0,Fresh,"Prior to this summer's unlikely sleeper hit March of the Penguins, the most famous pop-culture penguin was probably Opus."
1,Rotten,"Despite its fascinating and humorous moments, one can't help but be frustrated when at times it switches away to spiritual pretentiousness."
1,Rotten,"John McClane called, he'd like his storyline back now."
0,Fresh,An engrossing tale with fine performances and is at its most enjoyable without too much plot analysis

0,Fresh,"Bonsai illustrates the unbearable lightness of loneliness in a quiet, delicate manner."
1,Rotten,"Remember what a fun couple Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves were in Speed? Well, forget that."
1,Rotten,Bereft of the more richly textured sentiments of Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso.
0,Fresh,Post Tenebras Lux does (just about) repay viewers' tolerance with an intermittent succession of cinematic jewels.
0,Fresh,"When I think of this movie, I think of the subtlety in Mendelsohn's face - the camera close up - when he loses everything."
1,Rotten,"It's just terrible, with long stretches in which the sea of writers don't even try to insert any humour, followed by an attempted joke that doesn't work on any level."
0,Fresh,"Despite its tiny population (under 8000), this island has lessons that the rest of the world needs to take in. It is a laboratory in environmental sustainability that this film portrays vividly."
1,Rotten,This wannabe-elegant crime drama has the stench of a script Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington threw out an airplane window.
0,Fresh,"Exquisite and intellectually affecting in its brief, precise 80-minutes."
1,Rotten,"The Hustle certainly has its moments, but its hobbled by a specific miscalculation in its casting, which still makes me sad to report."
0,Fresh,"A small, lightweight, enormously clever and never cloying little jewel."
0,Fresh,"Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Detroit is a powerful, intense and moving film that can also be maddening to watch."
0,Fresh,"A bit melodramatic at times, but still charming."
1,Rotten,"Despite all its profound ambitions, this tasteless and painfully male-centric comedy insists cyber-stalking is romantic and farts are magical."
0,Fresh,"Glowing with the incandescence of a true movie star, the magnificent Gwyneth illuminates this entire, many-splendored production."
0,Fresh,Provides a fairly steady series of laughs thanks to the fully committed performances by the two stars and the sheer brazenness of its humor.

0,Fresh,"Judy broke me. Wonder, joy, melancholy and hope, these are the words that describe Renée's stupendously charming performance and the film as a whole."
1,Rotten,"Easy Rider, a sparsely written cross-country movie with a Don Quixote and Sancho Panza on extravagant motorcycles, is marred by draggy, romantic material."

0,Fresh,"As he makes drawings of his ""perfect specimen,"" chill pervades and the heart stills. It's an intriguing balancing act."
1,Rotten,"Roman J. Israel, Esq. has pockets of intrigue, and writer-director Gilroy and Washington have teamed up to create a promising dramatic character. We just never get full delivery on that promise."
1,Rotten,"Fur's misstep, and it is significant, is in the creature design of Lionel. The resemblance to Chewbacca is uncanny. He also looks a little like Lon Chaney's Wolf Man."
0,Fresh,Inventively celebrates the sense of heightened vitality which is at the core of all Shakespeare's comedies.
0,Fresh,"Newcomer Isabela Moner, meanwhile, is an endearing ball of energy in the lead - wacky songs and all."
1,Rotten,"Jan Ole Gerster seems infatuated with his main character, but to little avail beyond reveling in his aimless despair."
0,Fresh,This suspenseful film and its star are as sharp as razors as they delve into the dark corners of life.
0,Fresh,"""Storks"" doesn't talk down to its younger audience, but more importantly it doesn't ""joke down"" either - the film is packed with rapid-fire dialogue, well-developed goofy comic ideas and terrific voice casting."
1,Rotten,"I felt there was so much more there that could have been told, more struggles that should have been shown."
1,Rotten,A mess of would-be satire and condescending humor that never works for a second. Every person involved with this disaster should be ashamed.
0,Fresh,"Fincher doesn't make bad movies and this is a very good one. Of his nine features, I'm going to put this on my list at number four, after Zodiac, The Social Network and Fight Club. That's good company, on one hell of a list."
1,Rotten,...Eastern Promises is intensely anti-dramatic.
1,Rotten,It's a pity that all this exposition is written with such clunkiness that it would make George Lucas yelp.
0,Fresh,"Chandor is a visual master and in ""Triple Frontier"" he creates an epic and visceral adventure that's the kind of action movie that feels like it is part of a bygone Hollywood era, one in which smartly-delivered action spectacles used to be the norm."
0,Fresh,"While Greengrass lacks the poetic flair of a director such as Michael Mann, he has his own assured, breathless style, characterised by rapid editing, flash pans and jolting zooms."
0,Fresh,"A provocation, thinly disguised as a documentary, that succeeds in being almost as funny as it is offensive."
1,Rotten,"It's bad enough that the performers, a largely British cast of well-known actors, are pretending to be French -- but on top of that, they're speaking English."
1,Rotten,It's a message movie with a wildly overqualified cast.
0,Fresh,"A gorgeous looking film that manages to survive its anthropomorphization and the related narration by Tim Allen that, quite frankly, sticks out like a sore thumb. (Full Content Movie Review for Parents also available)"
1,Rotten,"Strictly dullsville -- a lackluster thriller and inept romance, directed with remarkable lack of imagination by Taylor Hackford."
0,Fresh,"Already, Hillcoat's film has divided critics on the international festival circuit. The one constant is the praise, rightly so, for Mortensen."
0,Fresh,"The action is non-stop, the jokes (though aimed a little lower than usual) are rapid-fire, and the Lego world of bright colors and mechs and machines is something that Lego fans can enjoy."
0,Fresh,"It's disappointing that this girls-are-strong theme doesn't play out as smartly as it should, but that's the one weakness in this sleek, joyful, entertaining film."
0,Fresh,"While hubris, and catharsis can make for great viewing -- and Greed is very entertaining -- rather than leaving the theatre incensed and hungry for change, you may find yourself arguing about morality between characters who don't even exist."
1,Rotten,"Chasing Liberty boasts exceedingly high levels of improbability and an embarrassment of continuity and character shortfalls, but still has a certain bubbleheaded charm."
0,Fresh,Riddick chugs along on Diesel's raw charisma. It's a popcorn movie that seldom takes itself seriously and never minds being Riddick-ulous.
0,Fresh,"Astaire and Rogers last teaming, and full of wit, music, dance, and comedy."
0,Fresh,"The pleasure of the movie lies in the way it both rewards and subverts expectations, delivering on the risqué possibilities of its premise while also coming up with something smarter and a little deeper than a log line might suggest."
0,Fresh,Offbeat relationship between a Senegalese cab driver and a suicidal Southerner makes for an interesting character study.
0,Fresh,"While not without its one big flaw, Breakfast With Scot is one of those movies that just makes you feel good. It takes some heady subject matter and turns it into a lighthearted holiday movie that is well-acted and thoroughly enjoyable."
0,Fresh,A trip to Madagascar is better the second time around.
1,Rotten,"The central problem is that the film, for all its gothic iconography and moody lighting, is a silly bore. Global warming is scarier."
1,Rotten,"It may be the worst movie of the summer movie season, which is pretty impressive since it just kicked off last week. This one is toxic."
0,Fresh,"Seeing the Amazons training with beautiful ferocity, seeing women so powerful and skilled...was a revelation."

1,Rotten,"A dreary species of empty pomp and circumstance, far too similar to many of its summer movie brethren and disappointingly dissimilar from its superior predecessors."
1,Rotten,Lugubrious affair involving a young man suffering from weltschmerz and the two women he loves set in Brighton Beach.
0,Fresh,"Formally experimental, headily disorienting and an aesthete's wet dream, The Strange Colour of Your Body's Tears is a schizophrenic blend of arthouse and charnelhouse."

1,Rotten,The facsimile is pointless but dependable until Lee and his screenwriter add increasingly ludicrous embellishments.
0,Fresh,"Come To Daddy is one of the best debut films I've seen in 2019. It's incredibly surprising, shockingly funny, and ruthlessly violent."

1,Rotten,This movie is in desperate need of a pulse.
0,Fresh,"This isn't a movie that grabs you by the throat, it's one that sneaks up on you and gets under your skin. FRUITVALE STATION is an authentically raw motion picture that I won't soon forget."

0,Fresh,Haroun's formal skill confirms his continual promise.
0,Fresh,Panahi's two principal themes - film theory and (inevitably) 'domestic' politics - coalesce into one as his own cloistered status finds its mirror in a personal filmography that has become more and more constrained.
1,Rotten,"With a script as loopy as this one, it pays to cast intelligent-looking actors. They can delude you into feeling as if you're watching something interesting."
1,Rotten,"If the degree of laughter at the wrong moments and the number of walkouts at the Toronto International Film Festival are any indication, the film will appeal only to the most fondly indulgent."
1,Rotten,Not a strong enough movie to truly strike at the heart of corruption.
1,Rotten,Adam Sandler's almost impressively steady spiral into irrelevance continues with Sandy Wexler...
0,Fresh,"The action is fast, the gags are plentiful - and many actually are funny if you check your squeamishness at the door."
0,Fresh,"[It's] observant of the distance between children and adults, and has radiant work from Garner and Ruffalo, as romantically conflicted characters that for once seem human."
1,Rotten,"Pretty damned bad, and another example of 2014 CG used to animate 1974's science fiction ideas."
0,Fresh,"The animation is just plain jaw-dropping, and the implementation of 3D gives the film an added boost of visual splendor. You feel like you're living it."
1,Rotten,"It's just all, unfortunately, a little stronger on the pretty pictures than it is on interesting characters, or sharp comedy."
1,Rotten,The ideal date movie if your tactic is to yawn your inamorata into bed - even the most unremarkable sex would be more diverting.
1,Rotten,How to Talk to Girls at Parties is overshadowed by its need to be eccentric and so it's hard to take it very seriously even when it's trying to take itself seriously.
0,Fresh,"Dracula deserves its status as a classic, although one might be tempted to append the word 'lesser' to that label."
0,Fresh,The most authentic Spielberg film Spielberg never directed.
1,Rotten,"All About Steve is a messy assemblage of clumsy sight gags, winking reaction shots and disingenuous populist genuflection to the idea that there's no such thing as normal. We all see a little bit of Mary in ourselves, don't we? Don't we?"
0,Fresh,"Antal proudly wears Tarantino influences, lingering in humorous conversations that race out on tangents, adding flavor to characters while also subtly developing themes."
0,Fresh,"Playful comic-horror is a fine diversion. Consumers, beware!"
1,Rotten,It's not a problem that they went and remade Robocop. But the biggest problem with this Robocop is that it's a remake.
0,Fresh,"Interesting, if not fully realized, version of the Vonnegut novel."
1,Rotten,"Or, Pretty Fly for a White Guy: The Movie."
0,Fresh,"Victoria is superbly executed, character-driven, and full of twists and turns that will keep you watching and riveted to the screen at all times."
0,Fresh,"Underneath its hocus-pocus is a compelling story, very well told."
0,Fresh,"A fun, disposable animation designed for short attention spans and lovers of garden ornaments."
1,Rotten,There are so many ideas here that the movie never decides upon a single one to follow through on to the end.
0,Fresh,"This three-hanky picture further develops and strengthens the motivations of toy heroes-and miraculously, in a way that doesn't retread what came before it."
1,Rotten,Paquin... and especially Grainger shoulder the film's dramatic burdens with grace and ease... But the unassumingly square and overly familiar film simply isn't the buzzworthy vehicle their work deserves.
1,Rotten,"A by-the-numbers romance, this momentarily interesting picture is very much of the Nicholas Sparks brand."
0,Fresh,"The acting is good, plot holes many and concession stand just down the hall."
1,Rotten,"""One Day"" turns out to be one of those apparently cinematic feats of writing that really doesn't fit the screen."
1,Rotten,A gender-focused comedy that feels both uncertain and out of step.
0,Fresh,"Some may have cried ""the sky is falling"" after witnessing ""Quantum of Solace""; fear not, dear moviegoers: ""Skyfall"" places the Bond franchise squarely back at the top of the action film stratosphere!"
1,Rotten,"Lacking a fiery spark to set his kerosene-drenched ideology aflame, Jon Stewart winds up cinematically self-immolating, pandering and condescending to everyone."
0,Fresh,An impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent.
0,Fresh,"Some of the roguish partners' mugging at the camera and sly personal ""asides"" may get on your nerves once or twice, but in most respects this is an acceptable sequel..."
0,Fresh,It's always nice to see Clint.
1,Rotten,Ratner isn't a capable enough director to work the alchemy needed to make this cheese into gold.
1,Rotten,Hated it so much so very very much
1,Rotten,"Boasts undeniably smart and eye-catching qualities that are significantly diluted by the relentlessly frantic and overbearing behavior of most characters; someone is always loudly imposing himself upon another, to diminishing returns of enjoyment."
1,Rotten,It's all a bombastic mishmash that makes you feel like you've been stuffed inside a kaleidoscope and shaken for two hours.
1,Rotten,"For all its provocation, Kedma is an often dull, incoherent film, and its characters remain frustratingly sketchy."
0,Fresh,"Griffith's later films are unquestionably superior. But here, in a very real sense, is where the movies began, both as an art and as a business."
1,Rotten,"This primitive effort needed much more work on the screenplay, a director with some grasp of pace, and a budget that could have done justice to its ideas."
1,Rotten,War in Iraq isn't funny -- neither is this movie.
1,Rotten,"An enchanting look at unlikely powers of love, this comedy is fluffier than a croissant just out of the oven. That's not good enough."
1,Rotten,Dennis Quaid's performance is the only bright spot in this dismissible thriller. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,A mental health exploitation picture.
1,Rotten,"If the film was any more shallow, it would be a piss-puddle in Death Valley."
0,Fresh,One could melt into the luxury of the experience Mr. Abrams provides and objectively appreciate every penny spent in the budget as there is not a false or cheesy speck to be found on screen.
1,Rotten,It would be passable if the third act didn't completely go off the rails.
0,Fresh,"Even if you do not see this movie yourself, please encourage any young woman you know who is considering enlistment to watch this movie first."
1,Rotten,"Segal loses his light-comedy touch after the first hour and makes an unfunny mess of the final, 'crackpot' chase sequence."
0,Fresh,Joel and Ethan Coen have created an excellent film that intelligent audiences should really appreciate.
1,Rotten,It isn't until the rushed conclusion when director Patrick Creadon shows the possibilities of what the documentary could have been.
1,Rotten,"While one might wish to commend Wan and company for making a horror pic that's less reliant on gore and gross sadism than the ones that they're normally associated are, what they're serving up as an alternative really lacks."
1,Rotten,Neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored.
1,Rotten,"What's most difficult about Sorkin's intricate fantasy is not acknowledging Jobs' darkness, but setting aside all hope of seeing the real man who inspired it."
0,Fresh,"Sex and the City 2 is a champagne cocktail on a runaway train -- fizzy, sparkly, giddy-making, and splashing all over the place."
0,Fresh,"The plot is strung together with a cracking pace, as if Frears were afraid audiences might tune out at any moment and switch to reading Armstrong's Wikipedia page."
1,Rotten,One of those indie excursions to Loserville that lasts an hour and a half but feels longer than Roots.
1,Rotten,"... the ""devil in the detail"" prevents George ... from delivering a more searing condemnation of those who, through [murder] or willful blindness, allowed the slaughter ..."
1,Rotten,"As great as the special effects may be, if you aren't buying the performances ... then what you are left with is a glorified Weather Channel documentary."
0,Fresh,"A tale of empowerment that packs one hell of a cinematic punch, Django Unchained is Tarantino's epic masterpiece."
0,Fresh,"A pat and generic, if serviceable, political thriller."
1,Rotten,"It feels like the pilot for a dated nineties sitcom, just not one I'd like to watch. Where are Aniston's friends when she needs them?"
0,Fresh,"It's about the slow, inevitable grind of marriage. It's about the eternally unknowable curveballs life throws at you and how you either step up to the plate toward triumph or turn away in tears or terror or both. It's about love."
0,Fresh,"The best bachelor party movie since, well, ""Bachelor Party"""
1,Rotten,"A lack of thesis makes Maryam, in the end, play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special."
1,Rotten,The heavy-handedness of the direction makes the film a lesser experience than it might otherwise have been.
0,Fresh,"Bowie knew how to play his audience, and the documentary shows him as a fiercely concentrated performance artist on and offstage, who micromanaged everything from his makeup palette to the length of his kimono sleeves."
0,Fresh,The animators kept the borscht belt humor coming... in a fable that fits right in with the bedtime stories of Hans Christian Andersen.
0,Fresh,"The movie is so well-acted, with Will Patton's performance in particular so quietly engaging, that we have to give the ensemble credit for turning in an enjoyable and heartwarming film."
0,Fresh,The ultimate effect of An Inconvenient Truth is not unlike looking down the barrel of a loaded gun.
0,Fresh,"Yes, there's no higher purpose behind the movie, just an ambition to make you enjoy being uneasy. Still, in its very limited way, ""Breaking In"" could be called some kind of a good movie."
0,Fresh,"Daniel Day-Lewis's magnificent, sanguine performance as oilman Daniel Plainview is just one of many reasons to catch P.T. Anderson's latest feature."
0,Fresh,"If you're even remotely interested in a new Star Trek film, this feels like everything you could have asked for. Here's hoping the great adventure continues for another 50 years from here."
1,Rotten,"Bright, sunny and almost instantly forgettable, even Jerry Seinfeld can't stop Bee Movie from boldly going where far too many CGI animations have gone before."
0,Fresh,"The shenanigans have been pared into 84 minutes of transgressive, potty-minded farce, that is often Waters at his most cheerful and most thematically focused."
0,Fresh,"A lively, affectionate and well-acted romantic comedy."
0,Fresh,"It is low-tech stylish, which gives it its convincing power."
1,Rotten,"The movie's expressive moments-and there are many-are largely uprooted, decontextualized, and dematerialized, planted like index cards rather than allowed to unfold and to develop."
1,Rotten,"The animation serves as a distancing device akin to the way that Folman's mind used concealment to shield him from horrific traumas, a canny marriage of thematic and aesthetic concerns that nonetheless can't cover up the unsubtle redundancy of his story."
0,Fresh,"A life study of an urban landscape, from its illegitimate birth through traumatic maturity, and on into a not-quite death that, for the generations who call City of God home, is a perpetually self-fulfilling cycle."
0,Fresh,"There's a certain beauty in the bleakness, in the stark, snowy landscapes, and in the characters whose lives are just as barren."
1,Rotten,Joker is the perfect movie for 2019. Joker is our comeuppance.
0,Fresh,"As a product of our globally-aware disaster-ridden times, Cloverfield touches upon interesting themes ... But it doesn't do much more than just glaze over [them]."
0,Fresh,"The plot is serviceable enough, but it's really just an excuse to showcase some remarkably original choreography and athletic dancing."
0,Fresh,A grim but measured and intelligent art-house slow-burner.
0,Fresh,It's an independent drama of the most unusual sort-the sort that situates itself unapologetically inside American poverty.
1,Rotten,We waited 42 years for laughable plot twists and fan service on steroids?
0,Fresh,"""Beyond"" is the highlight of The Animatrix and ""A Detective Story"" is its nadir."
0,Fresh,"Important, heartfelt drama about the plight of responsible, work-focused illegals victimized by an unforgiving American bureaucracy deserves attention but, like its subject, faces a daunting reality."
1,Rotten,Spiking sentimental family values with crude hilarity isn't the recipe for an award winner.
1,Rotten,Gorgeous atmospherics and good performances with a convoluted and overstuffed plot.
0,Fresh,"Crumb's sense of humor is his saving personal grace and the movie's insurance policy against total immersion into the morbid. But just so you know, Crumb fully earns its most revealing screen credit: 'David Lynch Presents.'"
0,Fresh,A technically solvent film that has several scenes with an undeniable visual strength. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"The Technicolour film's strongest suit remains the way it captures the jubilant celebrations in the city, and the dance sequences which showcase the samba skills of the leads."
0,Fresh,"Dying this past September, Rivers failed in her longevity goal, but has left a legacy of unforgettable comedy that was never afraid to piss people off even as they howled till their sides split."
0,Fresh,"It's a study of human nature, not at its worst, but at its most typically pathetic, and it goes to show that the more things don't change, the more they stay lousy."
1,Rotten,"This film left me wanting. It seemed like a sure-fire story on the surface, which just proves how many things can go wrong from conception to execution. The Founder is as forgettable as a fast-food hamburger."
0,Fresh,Heart-warming.
1,Rotten,"As written and directed by Brooks, the movie's overreliance on sex, scat and Semitic jokes wears painfully thin halfway through the picture."
1,Rotten,Can be fun if your expectations are low enough.
0,Fresh,Crowe is back to what he's good at: small stories populated by everyday people.
0,Fresh,"Much as I deplore Mr. James Stewart's escape from his responsibilities into the lazy histrionics of the Western, I must admit that in The Naked Spur he seizes every opportunity to act with all his familiar subtlety."
1,Rotten,Is it A Bigger Splash or A Bigger Bore?
0,Fresh,"An effective attempt to place a werewolf story in an incongruous setting, with the closely observed details of that setting used to make the story seem more believable."
0,Fresh,"Although it has a modern visual style and a mise en scne more in tune with The Neon Demon and Mulholland Drive, Aaron Katz's very enjoyable Gemini is one of the most laid-back Los Angeles mystery films since Robert Altman's The Big Goodbye."
1,Rotten,"Overweening showman that he is, Stone tries to give the financial mess a dramatic arc. But the sequel tries to do too many things, and a lot of them just arent that interesting."
1,Rotten,"While Gkhan Tiryaki's cinematography is phenomenal, the film is, at its best, a wasted opportunity."
1,Rotten,Think a Sly Stallone-scripted action movie starring The Stath is a sure-fire winner? Think again.
1,Rotten,Christmas dinner won't be boring this year.
1,Rotten,The craftsmanship is undeniably polished. It's just too bad the story is so plodding and pretentious.
1,Rotten,Crossing the line into pornography never seemed so simultaneously safe and repressed.
0,Fresh,"Seldom has any movie shown so much geriatric sex and full-frontal nudity (male and female). But, thanks to Dresen, it is all done with taste and sensitivity."
1,Rotten,"Heartfelt and well-intentioned, but it comes across like an adult version of an afterschool special."
1,Rotten,"A dead man is at the center of Rough Night, but the women forced to deal with him never feel truly alive."

0,Fresh,Michael Clayton is an intelligent thriller that takes time to explore little crevices of character along the way ...
0,Fresh,"This is no spiritual journey, it's a meteorological one, out the capture aquatic ferocity and personal victory using the latest in industry trends."
0,Fresh,"What resonates in Scott's graceful, grownup, pristine film is its majestic mind."
0,Fresh,"This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters."
0,Fresh,"It does have one thing on its side: It's freakin' hilarious, man."
0,Fresh,"If the emotions or ideas in Ad Astra aren't comfortable, they are thankfully not dull. [James] Gray creates a consistent sense of danger and makes the tormented Roy just sympathetic enough to get an audience worked up about his fate."
1,Rotten,De Palma always winds up letting his worst instincts get the better of him.
1,Rotten,"Directed by a Frenchman with the single, not uncatlike name of Pitof, Catwoman is a howlingly silly, moderately diverting exercise in high, pointless style."
0,Fresh,"In The Fade is a challenging movie to sit through just based on its content, but it's beautifully composed cinematography and phenomenal performances make it the challenges worth it."
0,Fresh,"Both a respectful tribute to Mexican culture and a grin-inducing, thematically powerful and intensely gorgeous adventure, Coco really is magical."
1,Rotten,"As an especial embarrassment, here Jason Statham's superficial manipulability is put in service of corny capering and costuming."
0,Fresh,"With weeping violins, wailing cellos and melancholy piano wall to wall, this sentimental story of sisterly love found, lost and found again is beautifully made. The big but is the needlessly complicated storytelling"
0,Fresh,Insurgent falls short of hitting the bar set by superior YA film adaptations but is a step in the right direction for the Divergent series.
0,Fresh,What the 3-D film lacks in cinematic charm and ingenuity is compensated for by its subject's high-wattage charisma and low-key earnestness.
1,Rotten,"While Jarvis puts a memorable mug to the script's meditations, you have to squint too much to see director Rowland's signature on this broad idea of machismo."
0,Fresh,"Despite its flaws, it really is a funny, witty, and suprisingly charming slob comedy"
0,Fresh,"Ponzi master Madoff muted whistleblower Harry Makopolis' blasts for decades, as shown in this dark documentary intrigue that filmmaker Jeff Prosserman cloaks in film noir style."
0,Fresh,"Funny, heartfelt, well-acted and refreshingly honest. It's one of the best movies of the year."
0,Fresh,"In the end, Miller has done it and done it righteously - reimagining a sturdy franchise and living up to the original, while kicking the tired reboot to the curb. Fury Road is rife with activity and fertile with ideas."
0,Fresh,"A work of staggering ambition, grandeur and terrible beauty. In a word: majestic."
1,Rotten,"You'll stumble in your seat all right, not so much out of fear but lack of balance, your inner ear destroyed by random blasts of sound."
1,Rotten,"The 2009 version, perhaps like New York itself, is flashier and far less gritty. The camerawork is busier, the effects are expensive, the colours louder. The soundtrack, a bastard mix of rocky techno and crude drum 'n' bass, recalls a car ad from 1996."
0,Fresh,Most of the movie doubles down on the mania and lacing the sugar-rush sensation with an almost lysergic sense of silliness.
0,Fresh,Parasite is unquestionably one of the best films of the year.
0,Fresh,"""Roma"" is magnificent."
0,Fresh,"As I left the theater, the first words that were uttered under my breath was, ""Oh, so this is what Cinema feels like?"""
1,Rotten,This film desperately needs a Cillian Murphy look; a Brendan Gleeson heart; a Naomie Harris spirit.
0,Fresh,Road to Perdition grabbed my attention simply by being a solid story told with style and intelligence.
1,Rotten,A string of hyper-stylised action sequences cut to ribbons so that you could hardly follow what was happening at any particular moment.
0,Fresh,"I'd rather have my heroes less than super, more engaged with the larger world."
0,Fresh,This is one of those films that works best if you can forget about the source material. Selick's film is more like a three-ring circus.
1,Rotten,Have teenagers always been this idiotic or does Project X move the goalposts?
1,Rotten,A thriller which begins promisingly before descending into a slough of old lag clichs.
0,Fresh,"The latest magnum horror opus from the mixed-up mind of Tim Burton is an fx feast for the eyes, but leaves a hollow spot in the spiritual soul."
0,Fresh,"As with the original film, there's little to offend the most myopic fan of the books, but also little room for the imaginative extension of the author's universe that distinguishes an inspired adaptation from a merely workmanlike one."
1,Rotten,"A watchable young cast, led by Brooklyn's Emory Cohen, and some time-shifting narrative shenanigans can't quite rescue Detour from the annals of also-ran western noir."
1,Rotten,"The European equivalent of The Matrix Revolutions, this third chapter finds a once-vibrant saga largely coasting on the fumes of its well-regarded predecessors."
0,Fresh,"Carell, Cranston and Fishburne, along with Johnson, are superb. They all reach within themselves to portray these characters with the truth and conviction demanded, warts et al."
0,Fresh,Next time NY won't be so lucky. A really big storm might kill thousands and leave us under water for months. This film shows us what forces are operating to make that more likely and what must be done to overcome them--starting with the Kochs.
1,Rotten,"A mediocre widget stamped straight out of the mold of the popular police procedural, the kind featuring a master detective."
0,Fresh,"Despite its plot's mechanical issues, The Nice Guys has all the makings of must-see DVD and Blu-ray, when its long-winded story can be offset by the ability to rewind and rewatch some truly funny moments."
0,Fresh,"Has a lot of charm, which accounts for its success."
1,Rotten,Just some excuse Tom Cruise found to get more greased up and shirtless than he did playing volleyball in Top Gun
0,Fresh,"For those who surrender to its atmosphere, and appreciate an unconventional cinematic experience, it's extraordinary."
0,Fresh,"""Coachella"" is an eminently worthy snapshot for contemporary music fans, not just of the festival but of the best in modern music"
0,Fresh,"As a one-off serving fans a nostalgic dose of a mid-2000s fad, it's just what the coroner ordered."
1,Rotten,"""Avatar"" looks amazing on Blu-ray. If the plot wasn't so pedestrian, it could have been a great film. Paul Chambers, CNN."
1,Rotten,"The by-the-numbers story never achieves its aimed-for grandeur or intensity, and the striking Turkish locations prove far more interesting than the characters."
1,Rotten,"God help us, we're all the way down to the 'switched bodies' plot getting a raunchy makeover, as if anyone asked for that."
1,Rotten,Both provocative and self-indulgent.
1,Rotten,Moviegoers that haven't seen alot of cop mysteries will probably like it. I have seen too many of them so it was very unoriginal and just silly.
1,Rotten,"It doesn't deliver the real goods, eschewing a deepening, psychologically penetrating narrative for a ""Frozen""-like, shapeless succession of eye-popping set pieces and impressive effects."
0,Fresh,"This is one of those films the phrase ""feel-good"" was invented for."
1,Rotten,"So bad it's funny. And yet, so bad it's just bad."
0,Fresh,". Like the chardonnay at the heart of the story, Bottle Shock is light with good body and plenty of flavour. It's also uplifting and amusing. In short, it makes you feel good."
1,Rotten,"Broadly sticking to the boxing movie blueprint is forgivable, Teller failing to properly sell the struggle of a man whose livelihood and reason for living is almost ripped away from him isn't."
0,Fresh,A predictable domestic comedy with some inspired comic touches.
0,Fresh,"While The Limehouse Golem does offer the chance to spend some time with the companionable Bill Nighy, as a police detective in 1880s London, some viewers may wonder what he and they are doing there."
0,Fresh,"I really enjoyed Super 8. Kind of loved it, even."
1,Rotten,"I cannot believe this is the Todd Haynes who topped my ten-best list in 2002 with the magnificent, unforgettable Far From Heaven. Headed for the No. 1 spot on my ten-worst list, I'm Not There is a tumultuous disappointment."
1,Rotten,"There's no plot worth describing, no repartee wittier than 'Oh shut up,' no acting moments that rise above the level of posing."
0,Fresh,"Quiet and quirky, yet refreshingly unpretentious, Off the Map is a welcome sojourn in a place that seems strange, yet entirely familiar."
0,Fresh,"Alas, In the Heart of the Sea is certainly ambitious, but it never quite reaches its full potential."
0,Fresh,"Richard Stanley's vision of Wells' hellish utopia never materialized, but its legacy makes for an appropriately insane real-life narrative every bit as brilliantly mad and maddening as the fiction promised to be."
0,Fresh,"Finding Neverland practices a tasteful restraint, embodied by Depp's unusually subdued performance."
0,Fresh,"Its richly occupied atmospherics of doubt, rancor and combative assertion should maybe add up to a little more weight, but that is wishing more than complaining."
1,Rotten,"If we're to slap protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she's French, do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept?"
0,Fresh,"Magic Mike might not have a lot to say about its characters or the male stripping industry, but the flashing bottoms, pelvic thrusts and toned six-packs that Soderbergh does deliver sure are a lot of fun."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, the entire endeavor seems like an effort to cash in on a predictably bankable tale."
1,Rotten,"A chintzy valentine to the world-shaking ebullience of one's own flimsily ""empowered"" friendships and one's most offhanded and tarted-up whims."
0,Fresh,"It's a premise as fanciful as Jimmy Stewart's Harvey, and yet the movie has a sweetness that manages to be pixilated and plausible at the same time."
0,Fresh,"It's a wonderful twist on the genre, and a surprisingly touching take on female self-empowerment and overcoming one's worst addictions."
0,Fresh,"Moulin Rouge fills the screen with wit and joy and sorrow untempered by the dry, self-conscious cool of most modern films. Its bravery alone earns rewards far beyond the price of its imperfections."
0,Fresh,"First time co-writers and co-directors Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer provide no surprises in their rom-com, except for bringing attention to Maya Erskine who shows a real talent for comedy."
0,Fresh,"Funny and precise, Guest's parody of Hollywood's hype machine and award-obsession reaffrims that he is not only an auteur but also a whole genre onto himself."
0,Fresh,"""Annabelle Comes Home"" is an expertly crafted jump fest. The scares come quick and extend over the film's refreshingly brief running time."
0,Fresh,...one of the best films out of Hollywood this year and Ben Affleck has become a filmmaker of note.
0,Fresh,"Dujardin is what really makes it all work, though. He's an absolute riot, with Conneryesque looks and physicality, and the ability to segue into utter goofballery with a degree of arch-browed suaveness."

0,Fresh,Frida is a film that celebrates but never sugarcoats the hard but exciting life of a brave artist.
0,Fresh,"It's still a galaxy far, far away, and it still looks like nothing we've ever seen before."
0,Fresh,"This film, based on a best-selling young-adult novel, works so well because the story comes without the traits that viewers have come to associate with young-adult fiction."
1,Rotten,Compliance is diminutively sufficient and blandly adequate with no additional layers that elevate its small independent nature. It feels rather one note riding on the promise of a distinctive tale that never totally comes to fulfillment.
0,Fresh,"The movie's chipper charms, and its steadfast determination to present an alternative to overly merchandised multiplex fare (there's nary a pop song or product placement here), ultimately win out."
1,Rotten,[It's] clearly meant to measure up to or reach past what Steven Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan. But it is one of the poorest imitations I have seen so far.
0,Fresh,"Madcap fun. It's Tom Arnold's finest hour, though that's not saying much."
0,Fresh,"The final book ... has been cleft in twain ... a move that is both cruel and absolutely necessary. Some will argue that the resulting product is merely half a film, and they'd be right. It's also one-eighth of the full story, so why start complaining now?"
0,Fresh,Louiso wrings all he can from performers and audience alike.
0,Fresh,an archetypal romantic comedy that reshapes the mold
0,Fresh,"I Love You, Man is basically just an excuse to get Rudd and Segel together to share the spotlight for 105 minutes while exchanging banter and giving a glimpse into how some men really think. For me, that alone is worth the price of admission."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, and perhaps not unexpectedly, it doesn't live up to the hype."
1,Rotten,Never mind the neo-psychedelic-pop soundtrack and occasional double-vision cinematography: Dope just can't account for the film's fried brain cells.
1,Rotten,Rudo y Cursi is appealingly tough and corny but contains little that causes these elements to congeal into anything greater.
0,Fresh,"The film isn't timid about showing the violence facing these women, and there are moments in which Gavron shoots Suffragette as if it were a war film -- in some ways, it is."
0,Fresh,"Even when Aronofsky doesn't have much to say, at least he says it with gusto."
1,Rotten,"There is something interesting about the tension between fact and fiction, but there's also something frustrating too."
0,Fresh,"Strouse wrote the film for Williams, and even though this is her leading lady debut, it's almost impossible to imagine any other actress or comedian bringing as much wit and charm to the title role."
0,Fresh,"Go for the thrill of the chase, go for the excellent yet fictional climax, go for the parallels between Harris' war against the Getty empire and the kidnappers' war on capitalism (a war that is impossible to wage without, yes, money)..."
0,Fresh,Fantastic behind-the-scenes sing/dance documentary which gives much more insight into the audition process than all those TV shows.
0,Fresh,"The conclusion is desperately trite, but Linney's performance helps this comedy - based on a novel by two nannies, take note - feel like a credible peek behind very expensive curtains."
1,Rotten,"Venom is just another cheesy teen horror movie, distinguishing itself only in its complete lack of suspense, a handicap that no amount of kinetic editing or bloodshed can overcome."
1,Rotten,"Logan is not really asking us to consider the plight of vulnerable children, it's encouraging us to get off on it."
0,Fresh,"A heartfelt movie that deals more nakedly with [Shyamalan's] core concerns than any of his other Hollywood films, and it doubtlessly will deeply touch many people as well as frighten them."
0,Fresh,"This ethical and philosophical quandary, of violence begetting enlightenment, is the soul of Gibson's artistry."
1,Rotten,"As a bit of cheesy Asian cinema, it works, but it didn't quite translate into a western without looking a bit like a Jonah Hex sequel."
0,Fresh,"A high-octane dose of summer-flavored fun, an AARP action film that comes along just in time to add a little levity -- and some serious weaponry -- to Hollywood's serious-minded fall awards season."
1,Rotten,We learn little about the characters other than that they're bored and restless.
0,Fresh,Several stalwarts of European cinema retread familiar territory in this light-as-a-feather upstairs/downstairs comedy set in 1960s Paris.
0,Fresh,"Gradually, boots and transvestite jokes become window dressing for a more touching story about the bond between Lola/Simon, a disowned son, and Charlie."
0,Fresh,"It's a story whose fatalistic ending has the impact of something that, like a repetition of the Holocaust, feels simultaneously unexpected and, devastatingly, preordained."
1,Rotten,The movie flirts with big concepts and then flakes out.
0,Fresh,"The production values of this film are very good, but it wanders away from its three main storylines often enough that it may not hold the attention of children."
0,Fresh,"Rather than reinventing the wheel, Abel and Gordon keep turning it with their own intimate touch."
0,Fresh,Most of the slapstick set pieces warrant a polite smile rather than a hearty guffaw.
0,Fresh,"[Gray's] feel for dialogue has rarely failed him, and it doesn't here."
1,Rotten,"The setup is appealingly small-scale, yet the film's tone is one of fake intimacy -- shtick parading as quirky truth."
1,Rotten,"Both the characters and the tone have been updated as a new generation of Grizwolds hits the road for a raucous holiday, eliminating the darker edges for a sillier, ruder romp."
1,Rotten,"Flat and just plain boring most of the time, Traitor wastes some fine actors -- Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Jeff Daniels and Said Taghmaoui -- and a topical story, finding no sparks in what should be an incendiary tale of terrorism."
1,Rotten,Insufferable.
0,Fresh,The idea of watching people risking being blown to smithereens might not create a box office blockbuster. But this is certainly director Kathryn Bigelow's best film since Point Break in 1991.
0,Fresh,What starts out as a promising sci-fi thriller loses precious steam in an underwhelming third act climax seemingly affected by budgetary limits.
1,Rotten,"The kids are charmless, the adults bemused."
0,Fresh,"Disturbing, overlooked, excellent film."
1,Rotten,"Despite its eccentric, boldly obvious central metaphor, the film feels bland and oddly inconsequential."
1,Rotten,"Predictable, flat, full of name-dropping, tragically unhip, and likely to make a decent amount of cash."
1,Rotten,Getting your head around the wider narrative is like attempting to discern the shape of a galaxy by staring at one island in one ocean on one planet.
0,Fresh,"Beautiful pageantry, smart political intrigue, and a convincing rapport between leads."
0,Fresh,Any movie that can make Samuel L. Jackson convincing as a great Memphis bluesman must be doing something right.
0,Fresh,"Spielberg injects real urgency into the film, which feels utterly relevant as we move into Donald Trump's second year in office."
1,Rotten,Truffaut protg Claude Miller sadly died shortly after filming but his directorial reputation will rest safer on earlier films such as La Petite Voleuse.
1,Rotten,Ugh!
1,Rotten,"Lacks the inspiration, genuine wit and raunchy charm of 1998's outrageous There's Something About Mary."
1,Rotten,Rarely do you encounter a movie without a shred of originality. You Got Served is such a cinematic vacuum.
0,Fresh,Beautifully shot.
1,Rotten,"...it doesn't help, either, that large chunks of the film have been improvised wholesale by the various actors, which only exacerbates the film's excessively slapdash feel."
1,Rotten,The remarkable career of artist and photographer Mark Hogancamp has been turned into an elaborate and misjudged movie of baffling pass-agg ickiness and pointlessness.
0,Fresh,"It is annoying, frustrating, embarrassing, and irresistible, which makes it a perfect Rorschach test and intriguing metaphor for contemporary Jewish identity."
1,Rotten,Eli represents yet another strange acquisition by Netflix from the old media - it's becoming clearer and clearer why these projects are getting dumped on streaming services.
1,Rotten,Writer and director are both only 25 years old -- and provide another example of why it's best to beware of young men with movie cameras.
1,Rotten,"The inevitable sequel delivers the same schtick, but it's only fresh by half."
1,Rotten,"Though De Niro gives a strong performance as a loving, if not always perceptive, dad, the film takes a treacly turn, grows truly sad and never fully recovers."
1,Rotten,"Michael Showalter is a funny man, but ... how to put this gently ... not a funny movie star."
0,Fresh,"A first-rate bare-chested-barbarian adventure, delivering impressive swordplay, flashy wizardry, and scantily clad heroes and heroines."
0,Fresh,"I really enjoyed this movie. J.Lo has an incredible dance scene, yes, but I really just liked this movie. It was good to see how much effort they put into this."
1,Rotten,"...if the thought of sitting through what is essentially 90 minutes of home movies makes you want to claw your eyes out, then you'll probably want to give this one a miss."
0,Fresh,"Unique location aside, it will show you many things you have seen before, only now you get to see Viggo Mortensen and Reda Kateb do them. Thing is, they do it good, and the film is never dull or without cinematic beauty."
0,Fresh,"For laughs per minute and a believable representation of how women interact, it's to be heartily recommended."
0,Fresh,"Knuckleball! is more than enjoyable if you are a fan of the game of baseball. And while it wouldn't be an obvious win for the uninitiated, Wakefield and Dickey do not make it difficult for the viewer to cheer for them."
0,Fresh,"What is actually happening over the course of the movie isn't as interesting as watching McKellen inhabit this character, so it's good news that he appears in virtually every single scene."
0,Fresh,"A sharp-edged, sweet-centred, warm-hearted coming-of-age movie that's always just that little bit smarter than you think it is."
0,Fresh,"An admittedly by-the-numbers affair, but garners some hearty and unexpected laughs through the machinations of its premise."
0,Fresh,"Awkward, but compelling and worth checking out."
1,Rotten,"Considering this is a film directed by Paul Schrader and written by Bret Easton Ellis, The Canyons is a limp and toothless piece of work from two artists who should know better."
1,Rotten,"Simple, yet stupid. A magic box grants a teen wishes... that don't come free. Apparently they're not making eighth graders read 'The Monkey's Paw' anymore."
1,Rotten,Bloody disappointing.
0,Fresh,"It's simple, but effective."
0,Fresh,"Eyes Without a Face has the staging and rhythm of Noir, and, up until one incredible scene, employs horror with implication and ambiance."
0,Fresh,The brilliance of this particular work is how it uses its genre trappings to strip away so much of the [stuff] that throttles films about older actors.
1,Rotten,"offers no decent characters, crawls along and often doesn't make sense - it's simply a mechanism to deliver a gun battle every 20 minutes. Those shootouts are good, just not good enough to stop you looking at your watch."
0,Fresh,A most enjoyable entry into the romantic comedy sweepstakes we are currently experiencing.
1,Rotten,"Touko Laaksonen sketched out an enduring legacy with his homoerotic images of hyper-masculine men. So, why then is Dome Karukoski's depiction of Laaksonen's rise from closeted pornographer to celebrated artist so flaccid?"
0,Fresh,"Visually and atmospherically, Marshland is suffused with an eerie oppressiveness, entirely at odds with the region's reputation for light-hearted alegria."
1,Rotten,"Going to see this film doesn't make much sense. It's obviously been cynically conceived as a franchise starter, but abruptly flicking to the end credits seemingly mid-movie is not a good way to start one."
0,Fresh,I found the escalating disreputability of Bad Santa completely cathartic.
0,Fresh,"Delivers romance, passion, heartbreak and surprises - beautifully. The film is an ideal chick flick, date movie and emotional tour de force for anyone who is a romantic at heart"
1,Rotten,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra, who has done several of Neeson's recent action movies, tries to spice it up with quick cuts and frenetic transitions, but it can't overcome a stale script."
0,Fresh,Cheerfully catch-all.
0,Fresh,"Bright, brash and unashamedly formulaic, this is thrillingly accessible fare ..."
0,Fresh,"Harrelson ... thoroughly understands Rex from the inside, immersing himself in the role of this charismatic man in a way that allows us to see both how compelling and how dangerous a parent he was."
1,Rotten,"More thriller than horror flick, this could even be viewed as a really dark comedy."
1,Rotten,"Yet, somehow, inexplicably, the movie is ponderous and flat, and needlessly freighted with tedious exchanges about the transience of love and the requirements of fidelity."
0,Fresh,"This is often surprisingly funny in a playful way, reveling in the textures of its setting and as much about celebrating the simple pleasures of sturdily made entertainment as meditating on age and the passing of an era."
1,Rotten,The makers of the movie you're slogging through will spare no expense to demonstrate how much they hate us.
1,Rotten,"Missing is Cameron's signature action modification, best exploited in Aliens: the strapping female heroine. McG's testosterone-juiced world feels a little doomed without her."
0,Fresh,"Gore Verbinski's sophisticated, extremely amusing CGI animated movie, a cartoon for adults as opposed to an adult cartoon..."
1,Rotten,"The performers are excellent and they score some laughs, but their roles here amount to ""the jealous friend"" and ""the progressive activist."""
0,Fresh,"Huge, uncomplicated and unashamedly cheesy fun."
1,Rotten,Another forgettable film. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Pleasant, funny, glorying in its own middlebrow-ness and blessed with the Big Cameo, you could do worse."
0,Fresh,"Tremblay, who was actually 8 when the film was shot, holds up well in a demanding role. This movie doesn't work without Larson, though."
0,Fresh,A well-paced flick with good action and gore.
1,Rotten,"The Wrong Missy is a stupid, misogynistic piece of retro garbage. But it meets the low expectations it has of itself. And Lauren Lapkus is hilarious."
0,Fresh,JJ Abrams is a miracle worker. He has taken a script that is so bad and so dumb as to be almost a disaster and made a movie that's a lot of fun and actually quite good from it.
1,Rotten,Gilliam fans will recognize their boy has been restricted again from crafting the all-out vision they know he's capable of
0,Fresh,"The colorful but limited animation can seem static on the big screen, but the gentle humor and equally gentle lessons will appeal to younger children and long-time fans."
0,Fresh,Ghosts of Sugar Land is a look at the jump from boyhood to adulthood-that inevitable journey of loss.
1,Rotten,"It desperately wants to be about something, but clearly isn't sure exactly what. Thus, engaging production design and budget-level effects work fall victim to an inane script."
0,Fresh,"You don't need to have seen Before Sunrise to appreciate Before Sunset, but as a one-two cinematic punch on the subjects of love and aging these films have few equals."
0,Fresh,"Overall, the movie's low-rent British specificity is a + because the unique milieu provides a unique set of problems for the earthlings to overcome."
1,Rotten,"Just entertaining enough not to hate, too mediocre to love."
0,Fresh,"It's a fantastically over-the-top, drive-in B-movie for the streaming generation."
1,Rotten,There is not much point throwing Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried into a movie together if they can't devote every waking minute to making out.
0,Fresh,"A superb addition to the Skywalker Saga which is sure to leave fans with plenty to talk - and argue - about, Star Wars: The Last Jedi now stands proudly alongside The Empire Strikes Back as one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all-time."
1,Rotten,"It neither adores nor disapproves of its players, which leaves the moviegoer a little clueless, and unmoved."
1,Rotten,"What if Zach Braff acted in one more quarter-life-crisis movie, and instead of Sundance it went straight to video? If only that's what had happened to The Ex."
0,Fresh,Recent events give the documentary The Island President both an urgency and a poignancy.
0,Fresh,"Krasinski has fashioned one of the better films to view this summer, underscored by the performances of a dream cast..."
0,Fresh,"It's still enjoyable fantasy fun, but The Desolation of Smaug has difficulty coughing up reasons for its extended run time and legion of characters. And this is only the midway point in the story."
0,Fresh,"Forget Thor, Captain America, or anyone else the superhero movie craze has coming our way; I want more Kick-Ass!"
0,Fresh,A masterpiece that deserves to be seen and appreciated on a big screen.
1,Rotten,Starts out with a bang but ends up with a thud.
0,Fresh,Nice coming-of-age doc about an African-American teen who shares a Brooklyn brownstone with the white Jewish lesbian parents who adopted her and two adopted siblings.
1,Rotten,"A comic book -- mint condition, double-bagged -- that leaves you impressed only with its pristine hollowness."
0,Fresh,"Although it plays by the standard beats of the sports comedy, Early Man scores thanks to Aardman's trademark charm and wit."
0,Fresh,"US is a horror masterpiece brokered by the brilliant mind and talent of Jordan Peele, a filmmaker who will go down in cinematic history as one of our all-time greats in the genre of the macabre."
0,Fresh,"Paradise Now may not succeed in inspiring sympathy for these hapless terrorists, but it does compel an appreciation for the unbearable sense of humiliation that may fuel such acts."

0,Fresh,Van Sant's film is fascinating for many reasons.
0,Fresh,"executes with appropriate energy, poignancy, and just the right balance of tension"
0,Fresh,"Apart from the Oscar-nominated Streep, Benedict Cumberbatch, Margo Martindale and Chris Cooper also snatch great moments in the non-stop melodrama of mean, while director John Wells stands back and lets them rip."
0,Fresh,"To go into Hollywood Homicide expecting a serious cop film is to be greatly disappointed. As a mix-and-match buddy comedy, however, it has its moments."
1,Rotten,"About its protagonist, it hasn't the foggiest. Lili is an unknowable curiosity, with Redmayne's performance all mannerism and no inner life."
0,Fresh,The highly commendable results are achieved with a minimum of satiric hokum and a maximum of honest story telling.
0,Fresh,"Bouncy and sweet, Aquamarine has a mild feminist bent that's played for laughs, but it's definitely a movie for the shallow end of the pool."
0,Fresh,Trainwreck is anything but.
0,Fresh,"In less loving hands it would be an unholy mess, but the passion behind the sheer audacity of what Batman Ninja lays down transforms it into an utterly joyful experience."

1,Rotten,[T]he story is a hopeless mess that from the outset seems to be missing key exposition that might help fill in some of its many gaps.
1,Rotten,"What is needed here is not reproduction, but rather reinvention: an American-targeted Godzilla film rebuilt from the ground up."
0,Fresh,"Its mature and delicate exploration of human emotion makes it a moving watch, and it avoids the trap of excessive sentimentality or violence in its portrayal of a survivor yearning for justice."
0,Fresh,Desert Hearts ... captures its surroundings and emotional complications with bittersweet beauty and lyricism; its examination of queer yearning and longing looks withstands the test of time as resilient as a cactus in the desolate desert.
0,Fresh,A spirited comic drama.
0,Fresh,"The characters in  are immersed in the story in a tragic and unappealable manner, like miniature figures in a dollhouse, unable to avoid or change their destiny. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"While ""Real Women Have Curves"" suffers from an obvious and simplistic screenplay, it's a bright looking, well-acted charmer."
0,Fresh,You would need a soul of potash not to savour the delicious fauna and flattering southern light. But the film never gets far beyond the decorative.
0,Fresh,"Is it a great horror pic? The Ouija board would likely point to ""no,"" but if asked if it's a decent enough offering in the genre, it would easily slide over to the affirmative answer. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - Available)"
1,Rotten,"After a mostly quiet film, tension kicks into high gear in the third act, but it ultimately raises more questions than it answers."
0,Fresh,While it doesn't make a whole lot of sense when all is said and done [it]is worth seeing [and] will definitely provide moviegoers with some topics of conversation afterward.
1,Rotten,Director Menno Meyjes keeps the sci-fi suspense quotient up just enough to make the ending somewhat disappointingly pat.
0,Fresh,"Each morsel of well-rounded, perfectly structured storytelling becomes part of a coherent, exuberant whole, linked as much as anything by a potent political anger directed against inequality and abuse, be it emotional, physical or economic."
0,Fresh,"For now at least, we have to be content with this pleasing comedy in search of an editor."
0,Fresh,...plays at times like The Royal Tenenbaums without the twee affectations but nearly all the humor.
0,Fresh,Railroad Tigers is a capable wartime caper that thrives on the dynamism and efficient action choreography that manage to conjure a spectacle out of even the most ploddingly penned Jackie Chan vehicle.
0,Fresh,"It's a film of great humor and truth, and what the hell, most comedies overstay their welcome these days anyway."
0,Fresh,"If you don't feel the bones breaking, you're not watching closely enough."
0,Fresh,"A razor-sharp satire on class struggle and the evaporating America dream, which adroitly masquerades as a screwball star turn."
1,Rotten,This film is nothing more than a series of cliches strung together with a lot of shots of Hilary Duff in tight tank tops.
1,Rotten,"Chooses to embrace, rather than transcend via zany bawdiness, the schmaltzy genre within which it's operating."
0,Fresh,"Younger is correct that considerations such as age, religion and circumstance can be enough to keep people from simply loving each other. And he's able to wring decent comedy from a sad reality."
0,Fresh,"Some will balk at its excesses, but breathtaking action, profound emotion and a dark sense of fun make this the most ambitious, original movie event in years."
0,Fresh,"""Song to Song"" continually flits - like the butterfly seen in one fleeting shot - from theme to theme, from love (always love) to fidelity, betrayal, identity, art, freedom, captivity, forgiveness and mercy."
1,Rotten,"Like David Spade's underrated Joe Dirt, Dickie is great in concept, so-so in execution."
0,Fresh,"A fun, exciting -- and dignified -- sign-off for Captain Kirk and crew."
0,Fresh,Barbershop is a perfectly-executed example of a simple formula.
1,Rotten,"It wants to be weird, but it's terrified of being too bizarre."
1,Rotten,"The film can't escape the feeling that it's not even interested in its own premise or that its jokey, stunted characters are closer to sad than funny."
0,Fresh,"Given Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan had declined to return, this sequel to their macho sci-fi rumble in the jungle is surprisingly good."
0,Fresh,"As far as date night movies go, you could do far worse than the raunchy yet sweet Sex Tape, featuring solid comedic turns from Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, and Rob Lowe."
0,Fresh,It's a remarkable drama...
1,Rotten,"All too often, it dips into dour drama and schmaltzy romance."
0,Fresh,"It's not groundbreaking, but kids who enjoyed the original Peter Pan should welcome a trip back to Neverland"
0,Fresh,"Its examination of a woman reconciling the joys, pains, regrets and fears of her life resolves in a manner that is satisfying to the narrative, but which viewers might feel lacks an emotional catharsis."
1,Rotten,"Forsakes much of the occasionally clever, somewhat wry dialogue and situations of its predecessors in favor of a more generic action-adventure approach."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, Tigertail fails to say anything unique about the Asian-American experience and only skims the surface of its narrative."
0,Fresh,"Supplies an intriguing understanding of hoop dreams and engorged egos, ultimately ending up at a position of revolution that's atypically thrilling for a Soderbergh movie."
0,Fresh,"It's an impressively confident first feature from writer/director David Marmor and although it engages in some playful teasing in places, it also delivers real chills."

0,Fresh,Aren't we all sometimes guilty of desperately forcing human connection when we feel lonely? Ingrid Goes West suggests we are.
0,Fresh,"The movie is one giant, family-friendly folk-art fiesta, and more that, really, than a saga whose ins and outs wildly captivate or make us care."
0,Fresh,"The creature is aquatic, acrobatic but definitely not angelic, in this idiosyncratic mix of creature feature and horror thriller, with a dash of slapstick, and a pinch of black humour."
1,Rotten,Lucas is a toymaker and merchandising mogul who has long since lost the human touch.
0,Fresh,"You don't just watch Almost Famous, you listen to it. You groove on it."
0,Fresh,"Remaking the French hit Natalie, Atom Egoyan uses A-list trappings to fashion a B-movie romp that's sleek, slick - and not a bit silly. Seyfried gives Chloe the vital boost it needs."
0,Fresh,Bold and varied animation sequences lift this into the stratosphere before it falls back into Nance's obsessively layered narrative; the resulting film is both beautiful and disorienting (just like love).
0,Fresh,"Although it is astute and curious about death in a way that few films achieve, it is never too grim."
1,Rotten,"You're seeing your favorite band in concert. They take the stage, and play all the hits, but only the hits. That's what The Rise of Skywalker is, and it's designed to give the fans what they want and nothing else at all."
0,Fresh,"This is a complex, richly imagined film with a deep understanding, clear-eyed but compassionate. The stories it contains help us to be honest about our own."
0,Fresh,Comedian never comes full circle with the intimate details surrounding the personal life of Jerry Seinfeld. The real romanticism is about a man and his love affair with one main dancing partner-the companion called comedy.
0,Fresh,"Doesn't represent much movement from where Smith had placed himself with Clerks II, which means what you felt about the previous should be about the same as what you'd feel about the latest."
1,Rotten,"Instead of dramatic tension, Firewall makes do with a lot of frantic typing at computer keyboards. It's like watching Microsoft's Service Pack 2 download for nearly two hours."
0,Fresh,"Mulaney is as energetic and engaging as ever, perhaps reinvigorated by the stage after giving the sitcom thing a try."
1,Rotten,"To call it formulaic would be an insult to the actually formulaic entries in this genre. Those movies, for better or worse, are designed to bring you to tears. They earn those tears. Me Before You is more akin to a stick-up."

0,Fresh,A mis-mash of styles makes this film as genre defying as it is compelling.
0,Fresh,"Director John Polson mutes the conservative sexual politics of the original film, focusing on the lightweight, efficient suspense story."
0,Fresh,Bloodshot cannot help but be a cult classic in the making. This is Hollywood escapism at its finest at a time when we need it the most.
0,Fresh,The Exploding Girl is a character study of one young woman - and of an entire generation struggling to maintain external maturity despite internal regression.
0,Fresh,"Overwrought and overlong, Ang Lee's Lust, Caution nevertheless has some moments of exquisite beauty and a potentially star-making performance from newcomer Tang Wei."
1,Rotten,Eeryone should be offended by the time-annihilating suckage of this mirth void.
0,Fresh,"Despite early accusations that Berlinger's film seeks to glorify Bundy, the truth is that he's actually shining a light on our seemingly endless fascination with serial killers."
0,Fresh,"Enemy operates on a level of carefully calibrated unease, where the very elusiveness of motivation and logic is exploited for purposes of sustained cinematic disorientation."
0,Fresh,"Edge of Tomorrow doesn't go far enough in some respects, but its unique stylistic approach makes the experience an overall satisfying one."
1,Rotten,"There are a lot of good ingredients in Malevolent, from its concept to its cast. And the final 25 minutes are incredibly tense and scary. But the rest of the movie can't really hold its momentum."
0,Fresh,"Louis-Dreyfuss reveals colors and shadings we've never seen before, while Gandolfini is irresistibly likable in his least characteristic role."
0,Fresh,"Beautiful, slow-paced historical drama; violence, cursing."
0,Fresh,"It's done with few words but it's unexpectedly touching, fulfilling the film's key promise - that it's going to make you care about these people, despite the secondhand nature of its delivery system."
1,Rotten,Fails on an entertainment level.
1,Rotten,"As middling, somewhat serviceable horror fare, it delivers its own share of jump scares, but whatever visceral effect it might have had wears off the instant the credits begin to roll."
1,Rotten,"The dialogue is preachy, the drama too earnest and the action kind of sluggish, though it's hard not to get a jolt when Johnson jumps behind the wheel."
0,Fresh,"Alain Resnais' Night and Fog (nuit et brouillard) runs barely over 30 minutes, yet it manages to pack a lifetime of horrors into its half-hour length."
0,Fresh,...a smart and stylish corporate thriller driven by a really terrific performance by Anna Gunn
1,Rotten,"The Big Hit should be titled The Big Miss. That?s a really bad pun, but it?s better than anything in this movie."
0,Fresh,This comic drama rises far above the goofball antics that its premise suggests.
1,Rotten,This appalling mess of a movie just isn't funny.
0,Fresh,"Passable Star Wars entertainment...which adds up to it being sort of a disappointment. The messy production schedule is evident in final product, but it certainly has enough moments to make it fun at times."
0,Fresh,"The plot itself might not break much new ground, but the telling, by both cast and crew, makes this a memoir to remember."
0,Fresh,A thoughtful and thought-proving picture.
0,Fresh,"Filled with references to fiber, routers, drill bits, and data in milliseconds, ""The Hummingbird Project"" is a nerdy, but engrossing, film."
0,Fresh,"The picture would be nothing, an incomplete Venn diagram, without Murphy."
1,Rotten,Worst of all perhaps is Lost's smug air of pleasure at how clever it thinks it's being.
1,Rotten,"Gren Wells' screenplay throws around a few ideas about female independence and sexuality, but finally it's as shallow as it is mawkish."
0,Fresh,"'The Fighter' is the one that's based on the true story, but between the two, 'Warrior' not only feels more authentic, but it's a slightly more enjoyable watch, too."
0,Fresh,"Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck co-write and direct this fun and funny, clever, diversity-embracing episode. Captain Marvel enjoys her powers, Larson brings warmth to the ass-whooping."
1,Rotten,"One thing becomes abundantly clear. Even if you're 10, it's impossible to hold back a smile while swinging your hips to the merengue."
0,Fresh,A beautifully assured work of art that doubles as an up-to-the-minute portrait of the country's mood.
1,Rotten,"[Burton's] dark, melancholy vision is undeniably something to see, but it is a claustrophobic conception, not an expansive one, oppressive rather than exhilarating, and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying."
1,Rotten,"If you can't figure out all of the bad guys within the first ten minutes of the film, then you have not been getting your daily adult requirement of mysteries."
1,Rotten,"So literal is the antiestablishment vibe that whenever there's a moment primed to make kids wanna punch out an old square, they get to see it acted out."
1,Rotten,A by-the-book bio-pic.
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, your reaction to 'Dredd 3D' will depend on your tolerance for an almost breathtaking level of graphic violence."
1,Rotten,Space Jam is nothing if not a product made by men who gauge a film's success by how many soft toys it spawns.
0,Fresh,[a] dark and dour laugher that gleefully sticks its tongue out. Bad Santa is proof that getting coal in your Christmas stocking isn't such a terrible gesture after all
0,Fresh,"Sean Baker's Starlet almost miraculously transcends this story's cornball trappings, with a minor-key muted humanism and bruised emotions roiling just beneath the surface. It's a hushed marvel of a movie. "
1,Rotten,A bevy of Bronze Age beefcakes face off in something that resembles Greek myth if you kind of squint at it. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
0,Fresh,The story of George and Ben seems to have been plucked from a meadow of narrative possibilities; an interesting movie could have been made about everybody in this one.
1,Rotten,"Peyo's much cherished creations do little to nothing for me, and I can't say spending a 102-minutes with them in a live action-computer animated hybrid was all that high on my personal to-do list."
1,Rotten,"Instead of leading toward understanding, ""Rampart"" remains a dirty cop caricature, more a complaint than a story."
0,Fresh,"Despite such rich source material, however, Letters From Baghdad proves oddly unsatisfying."

0,Fresh,"Still going strong at the respective ages of 69 and 68, director Garry Marshall and his singing co-star Julie Andrews are the true royal couple of this straightforward sequel."
0,Fresh,"Avoiding stereotypes, the movie shrinks larger political and religious battles down to the people of a desert town - city dwellers and nomadic Tuareg people out in the dunes - being forced to change by a handful of halfhearted oppressors."
0,Fresh,"A Super Trooper of a sequel that is energetic, fun, and lively. It's an irresistibly fun time that you won't want let go of."
0,Fresh,"A killer concept and better execution. Part adrenaline rush/part social commentary on insta-fame and Internet mob mentality, Nerve is smarter than the typical teen thriller."
0,Fresh,Both modest and awe-inspiring.
0,Fresh,"Hugely complex, achingly sad and splendidly gorgeous."
0,Fresh,"North Country is crisp, efficient, often familiar in form, but exceptional in some ways. It's effective, for instance, in exploring how different women behave differently in the face of abuse."
0,Fresh,Gordon is a masterful storyteller when he's clicking on all cylinders. It's his best film in years.
1,Rotten,There is a reason to fear being alone in the dark: it's this movie.
0,Fresh,"It's one of Mamet's best. It's also one of Hackman's best, most mercurial performances."
1,Rotten,"Events unfold as chronological vignettes, and there's little room for screenwriter John Goldsmith to reimagine scenes to mine their full dramatic potential."
0,Fresh,Till death don't us part
0,Fresh,It works as a throwaway joke -- occasionally funny and often shamelessly tasteless. And it also helps if you like Shore.
1,Rotten,... the finished product feels like a lot of individual performances that don't quite fit together.
0,Fresh,"An offbeat experiment that, while certainly not a brilliant movie, flies far more than it fails."
0,Fresh,Certainly one of Perry's best films yet.
0,Fresh,"Cooke catches our attention with his sardonic, training-handbook tone, which doesn't exclude shock and indignation when needed."

1,Rotten,The movie's screenplay is a confusion of half-baked and unfinished ideas.
0,Fresh,"Myth and reality, past and present, tradition and progress go head to head in Yung Chang's remarkable documentary about China's longest river, Up the Yangtze."
0,Fresh,The color is handsome. The scenery in the Bahamas is an irresistible lure. Even the violence is funny. That's the best I can say for a Bond film.
1,Rotten,"The story holds it back from the ""classic"" status... All the same, Robots is cute and colorful. Kids will love it and parents will be entertained enough not to mind."
1,Rotten,"After Sideways and now Bottle Shock, it's official: I love wine as much as I hate movies about people who love wine."
0,Fresh,"In Baker, we have a director who can make ordinary, quirky and disorganised lives seem colourful, compelling and most of all, humanistic."
0,Fresh,"""Last Vegas"" is pure clean entertainment that will offer a fun night out."
1,Rotten,"Every event in the story ... seemed staged more to give Iñárritu a chance to show off technical virtuosity, to beat his own chest the way these characters beat their own."
1,Rotten,More about vulgar shock value and vivid period re-creations than it is an absorbing or convincing crime story.
0,Fresh,"It is an old-fashioned tell-me-a-good-story-and-let-me-be-entertained thrill ride, and while no one would ever confuse Lee's latest with one of his best it is still an effort worthy of exuberant praise."
0,Fresh,"Search out this fine, fascinating, warmhearted documentary."
1,Rotten,"Graduation, a borderline dramedy with somewhat interesting relationship crosscurrents among four friends facing life after high school, squanders audience goodwill with its tediously judgmental treatment of anyone who isn't flush with youthful promise."

0,Fresh,"It's impossible not to get caught up in it, even if you're simultaneously repelled by it."
0,Fresh,"Low-key, wistful, and disarmingly droll..."
0,Fresh,"The arty blockbuster has arrived, and it's as flashy, accessorized and auto-erotic as can be. Which creates a strange sensation indeed, that it's not just the cars that are smoking, but those Wachowski brothers as well, and whatever's in their pipes too."
0,Fresh,"It's ambitious and not entirely successful but there is a lot to like about ""Interstellar."""
0,Fresh,"Even without Wallace and Gromit, most of the trademark joys are here: the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery, the wide, open-ended rictus of a toothy smile, and the great Parkian gulp."
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, the pleasures of Christopher Robin are mild, but by being unafraid of those melancholy corners of the woods, where our childhood friends languish in the cold, dark shadow of our absence, it at least give you a lot to think about."
1,Rotten,"What does it all add up to? Look past the gimmick, and all that remains is an overly arty study of a lopsided marriage ..."
1,Rotten,remarkably derivative
0,Fresh,"Director Damien Chazelle's First Man puts that phenomenally difficult, dangerous event in the context of the wonder, the terror, the tragedies and the triumph that go along with it."
0,Fresh,"""Ghost Light"" is enjoyable enough to be enjoyed by fans of Shakespeare or those who have spent time in the trenches of community theater. As for the rest of us, the movie is nothing more than a slight, inoffensive flicker."

0,Fresh,"Gorgeous to look at, intriguing to think about and, at times, hard to sit through."
1,Rotten,"It looks like a dream, although it doesn't feel like one. It is, unfortunately, a minor film in Welles' filmography. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Doesn't match the weight of its predecessor, or really add anything necessary to the saga, but it doesn't hurt the body of work, either."
0,Fresh,"Raw is a new classic of gross-out horror, but it's also a finely tuned psychological piece about a disorder that affects millions of women."
0,Fresh,A welcome take on the timeless tale of growing up.
1,Rotten,"Consistently silly, occasionally funny but mostly forced."
1,Rotten,"For all of its airs of refinement, ""The Awakening"" is pretty stale stuff."

0,Fresh,"It may not be Burton's best film, or his most innovative, but it always stays faithful to his uniquely haunted soul."
1,Rotten,"The absence of deeper mystery pushes everything onto Greta's slick surface, where it slides into territory that's not only farfetched, but implausible and, in a few instances, laughable."
0,Fresh,"Most of its plot elements are overly familiar, but they're invigorated by Elliott's easygoing performance and the way Haley deploys them in explicit homage to his muse."
0,Fresh,"Black Gold moves at an inexorable pace, painstakingly building a case until suddenly it looms very large and casts an even longer shadow."
1,Rotten,"Even Steven Soderberg describes this as a sketch, an experiment, an exercise, so when one character sighs, ""I want this day to be over,"" I found myself nodding in agreement."
0,Fresh,The bleakness and myriad cruelties of the prison system are telegraphed with a graceful touch.
1,Rotten,"The movie's only unmitigated pleasure is a too-brief fight scene between Connor and a naked combatant made up to look precisely like Arnold Schwarzenegger, the relentless cyborg of the first three installments."
0,Fresh,"Corny, heavy-handed, but definitely romantic, The Scarlet Letter is a mindless piece of historical amusement."
1,Rotten,"I guess it was a pretty good movie, though I got a little bored halfway through and took a little snooze. I like air conditioning. There was lots of popcorn on the floor."
0,Fresh,"'High School High' may push the envelope a little too far at times, but you won't be able to hold back the tears from laughing so hard. The first 30 minutes are pure gold!"
0,Fresh,"This is one of those rare adventure movies in which character, not violence, is the backbone of the film."
1,Rotten,Rent falls betwixt and between the odd intimacy of theater and the glorious bigness of film -- and vice versa.
0,Fresh,The cast makes up for most of the missing pieces.
0,Fresh,"With the exception of a romantic interest for Nik to demonstrate what he's missing on the outside that rings slightly false, the film's realism gives a different shade to a story that follows a rather traditional route."
1,Rotten,The big-screen Get Smart aspires to being an action movie. Big mistake. But raising Maxwell Smart's IQ? And transforming him into a post-20th century sensitive guy? Even bigger mistakes.
1,Rotten,Non-Stop isn't a bad example of its type of film; merely an unexceptional one.
1,Rotten,"For casual fans of writer-director Kevin Smith, his new film, Clerks II, feels a little like the new Pirates of the Caribbean -- a similar wet fizzle of a sequel for sequel's sake -- but what do we know?"
0,Fresh,"It undoubtedly manages to grasp your attention with an outstanding central performance by Penélope Cruz (one of her best to date) cementing this as a hard hitting, harrowing and compelling picture."
0,Fresh,"Dabbles in the improbable loony male-driven fantasy of flabby slacker sex appeal, while taking pot shots at the snobbery of upwardly mobile gorgeous women who wouldn't give them a second look in actual life."
0,Fresh,"Derbez, who also directed the film, gives the movie a strong core through his expressive face."
0,Fresh,"A vision of which doesn't require its characters being frozen in amber after a fairy tale ending and allows life to go on, happily and unconventionally."
1,Rotten,...tedious...
1,Rotten,The chief function of this trite debut feature appears to be as a job application for its writer-director to join the Hollywood rom-com assembly line.

0,Fresh,"For those on the hunt for something agreeable, feature two acting legends, there are worse ways to spend 108 minutes. After all it's not every day one gets to see Katharine Hepburn man a Gatling gun."

1,Rotten,"If you've never seen 2002's Spider-Man you may be more forgiving to this one, but comparisons favour the former in almost every respect."
0,Fresh,"Viewers who live in this kind of false nostalgia will love it, because it has a steady stream of genuinely funny moments. But life was never like this."

1,Rotten,"A paper-thin, predictable family comedy."
1,Rotten,"It's just a pity that there wasn't as much attention paid to the script as the costuming department, because to paraphrase [Michelle] Williams' airheaded Avery, this movie is ""super weird"" and only partly effective."

1,Rotten,"[A]n awfully nice movie, with its heart in the right place... [but] deeply incompetent [and] chock full of terribly clich[s]..."
0,Fresh,"As each story comes to its conclusion, some characters rise above, while others are crushed under the weight of the day's events. The tales are equal parts miracle and tragedy. And that's often what life is, which makes Babel ring true."
1,Rotten,"There was a great movie in ""Creed II,"" one that peeked out every now and then beneath the suffocating blanket of clichés."
0,Fresh,There are just too many people for the characters to be well developed but this deficiency is balanced by the intimacy of Declan Quinn's cinematography.

0,Fresh,"The film, shot elegantly in color but with the dramatic feel of black and white, functions as a parable of power abused by the multitude. It takes a village to turn craven stupidity into fascist bestiality."
0,Fresh,"Rampart is very good at showing us a man who cannot come to terms with controlling his fury for long, and Harrelson makes us believe he exists."

0,Fresh,"Ultimately, it is hopeful in its depiction of the creativity that helped Peterson -- who also wrote and speaks the film's somewhat flowery narration -- rebound from the farm crisis that had him over a barrel."
1,Rotten,The comedy becomes a circus and ends up feeling artificial. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Alita goes through a simple story of embracing one's destiny, but her victory here feels small compared to the one the film really wants to whet our appetites for."
1,Rotten,"While there's no faulting the talent or good intentions of the people involved, however, they make the mistake of leaving out the spoonful of sugar, which makes the medicine get stuck in your throat. It's all message and very little movie."

1,Rotten,"The action scenes are still good, but the comedy itself is very slight."

0,Fresh,"Dunstan makes his directorial debut with this fast-paced, suspenseful horror that wastes no time on pointless exposition, but instead tosses plenty of genuinely tense moments into this primal fear-fest."
1,Rotten,"Engaging performers all, but the movie's superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas."
1,Rotten,"It's not good, but it's far from the worst."
1,Rotten,"Shallow and repetitious, Ephron's mildly amusing comedy is gimmicky without emotional pay-off, juxtaposing the stories of two American housewives, in which Meryl Streep gets the showy role and Amy Adams is stuck with the dull one."
0,Fresh,This time the filmmakers understand how to treat this female fusion of Indiana Jones and James Bond.
0,Fresh,"The film's most striking quality, and it's not insignificant, is director Margarethe von Trotta's refusal to fossilize the controversies she dramatizes."

1,Rotten,Paprika is yet another incoherent anime that's more interested in its warmed over visuals than in indulging in any kind of storytelling or character work.
1,Rotten,"Rounders is another nice notch in Damon's belt and an excellent commercial for Oreos, but its destiny lies as a dust collector on the video store shelves."
1,Rotten,The sort of heavy-handed fantasy that gives 'insufferable whimsy' a bad name.

0,Fresh,An earnest adaptation of Jane Austin's 1815 novel with a lackluster pace.
1,Rotten,"For whatever reason, cleverness of any kind is dispensed with about halfway through Bones, and the film descends into standard-issue schlock 'n gore that has no rationale beyond easily induced nausea."

1,Rotten,Ryan Reynolds should be very thankful he got to bow out early in the movie.
1,Rotten,"Neeson's character calls himself a ""preventer,"" because he keeps bad things from happening. Not this time."
0,Fresh,"The movie is very strong stuff, offering proof that Sherriff's play is unjustly neglected."
1,Rotten,The dire romantic comedy Valentine's Day is neither romantic nor remotely comedic.
0,Fresh,"Endearing, mordant, and impeccably acted."
1,Rotten,Divorce and separation are subjects too important to be treated in the bizarre way Alan Parker treats them in Shoot the Moon which is a film with lots of emotion but no heart.
0,Fresh,"Cars 3 is The Fast and furious back when it was strictly about being fast and furious, please believe me."
0,Fresh,'Maria Full of Grace' offers a clear picture of the economics that drive the hopeless many to take risks in the enrichment of the few.
1,Rotten,"A tepid remake of an already dubiously executed movie that inexplicably doesn't even double-down on those elements that would best antagonize its critics to make for something, well, if not gleefully irresponsible, at the very least memorable."
0,Fresh,Triple Frontier is engaging in parts with well-mounted action. But the characters lack definition and you can't help but think an old timer like Howard Hawks or Sam Fuller might have done it better in half the time.
1,Rotten,"Uneven Braff comedy OK, but lacks ex-citement."
1,Rotten,"An adventure crammed with junky slapstick and garish animation that seems to believe it is feminist, but only doubles down on Smurfily regressive notions of gender."
1,Rotten,"Welcome to Jurassic Shark. Glub, glub. A Dwayne Johnson film with Jason Statham as idiot's Captain Ahab."
0,Fresh,"""The Red Turtle"" is a visually stunning poetic fable, but there's more on its mind than simply beauty."
0,Fresh,"After a string of disappointments, it's nice to see Burton get back to his bread and butter: giving us a demented blend of laughs, drama, and scares."
0,Fresh,Randy Brown's script is a luddite fantasy that has Eastwood grumbling and telling technology to get off his baseball diamond...
1,Rotten,"Kidnap's clumsy clunkiness, exposition-heavy monologues and inferior story keep it in that late-night cable category that seems perfectly entertaining so long as you aren't paying for it."
1,Rotten,"Though handsomely staged and shot, the movie lacks urgency and thrills, and while the actors are adequate, they all seem strangely enervated by the task of pretending to be people they are not."
0,Fresh,Cleverly blends elements of True Romance and Drive. Its cult status seems assured.
0,Fresh,"The weakest of the trilogy, but this franchise never got old."
0,Fresh,"The film has an excellent pro-education, pro-history, pro-science, pro-geek, pro-nerd, pro-smart message, a swathe of historical tidbits, and awesome progressive details such as a schoolmate in a wheelchair for no plot reason (and never commented on)."
0,Fresh,"Hamri delivers a thoughtful, entertaining, imperfect but solidly adult movie about the inconvenient path of true love."
0,Fresh,"Very little of Lang's early work remains available to watch in this condition. Destiny is a real treat. Watch it, and see if it can inspire you as it did the likes of Alfred Hitchcock."
0,Fresh,"Aside from the all-pervasiveness of the prejudice, the film tracks the casual cruelty it entailed, and yet manages to not be grim. Part of this is a result of some artful writing."

0,Fresh,"An intellectually well thought out work that presents the events of those turbulent days in Irish history with clear, vivid reality, from costumes to sets to location."
1,Rotten,"A barrage of bad jokes, offensive stereotypes and dated reference points, the movie is like Meet the Fockers on overdrive."

0,Fresh,"Tarantino's signature style of filmmaking is on full display in the captivating, yet uneven ""Once Upon A Time In...Hollywood"" which is smoothed over in part by three terrific performances from Pitt, DiCaprio, and Robbie."
1,Rotten,A lack of focus and a meandering approach afflict this study of an artist at work.
1,Rotten,"While Tatum has rough charm, Dewan is more dancer than actress."
0,Fresh,"Prometheus asks a big, loaded question, but teasingly leaves the answer for another mission...and another movie."
0,Fresh,"Searing onto the screen as both a revisionist backstory of an iconic villain character and a pointed commentary on the cuddlier aspects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the new Joker movie is bold, violent, and unnerving."
1,Rotten,"Based on a comic-book series, it feels formulaic, unconvincing and disappointing."

0,Fresh,"Of course Ella Enchanted did the same thing, but what can I do, cry Tommy O'Haver's praises forever?"
1,Rotten,A chilling idea and an interesting central performance are undercut by pretty much everything else in this apocalyptic action film about a second American Civil War.
1,Rotten,Nothing about the movie felt fresh or inventive and it's hard to be interested when you're comparing it constantly to twelve different things that have come before.
0,Fresh,"""What She Said"" pays fitting homage, not just to a great writer but to a vanished age."
1,Rotten,"A movie tomb in which zombiedom is confused with - what's the phrase? - ""nuanced performances"". Fireflies may be a douche to freshen up the thesp skills of A-listers, but why do we have to suffer for their art?"
1,Rotten,"The deliberately lackadaisical, almost improvisational approach occasionally achieves striking moments, but mostly seems more flat and redundant."
0,Fresh,"Sawyers is uncannily good as Obama while avoiding plain mimicry. He's the proverbial young man in a hurry, only too cool to let you see him sprint. Sumpter has the trickier, tougher role (the first lady probably knows the feeling)."
0,Fresh,"Arlyck's new film is an honest and thoughtful examination of the people and events that most influenced his adult life and what the '60s really meant to the bigger picture, viewed with the benefit of hindsight."
0,Fresh,"The best part about the film is Jeté Laurence, who gives a very strong performance, one that asks a lot of the child."
0,Fresh,"Few would argue that Gary Oldman isn't one of the finest actors of his generation, but this is a tour de force portrayal that will define his body of work for decades to come."
0,Fresh,"A watchable drama enlivened by a strong cast and some superb location work, but it's not as emotionally satisfying as it could have been."
1,Rotten,I'm glad I saw it warts and all.
1,Rotten,"""High Strung"" wears its tired let's-put-on-a-show clichs as if they were neon turquoise leg-warmers."

0,Fresh,Russell Crowe as Maximus has the charismatic glower of a true star.
1,Rotten,This film wastes the talents of the entire cast.
0,Fresh,"Blade Runner's world is grotty, grey, crowded and retrofitted. This future doesn't jettison the past. It cannibalizes it, from ancient ziggurats to Art Deco glamour."
1,Rotten,"Despite the welcome addition of a romantic relationship to Ethan's life and the complications that it brings, the film is essentially a series of big action sequences so overpowering that we forget just what our heroes are trying to accomplish."
0,Fresh,"Watching Fish Tank is, as the title implies, like gazing through the glass of an aquarium at the lives of those trapped within, whose only chance of escape would seem to be through death and the indignity of being flushed down a toilet."
0,Fresh,"Bursting with bold colors and packing an emotional punch in the final moments that could make even the most jaded among you shed a tear, Coco is truly transcendent."
0,Fresh,Levy knows better to simply stay out of the dynamic duo's way and let them do their proven thing.
1,Rotten,More clunk than Clank.
1,Rotten,"The Farrellys are thorough in making sure each phase of matter - gas, solid, liquid - is represented via bodily-excretion gags."
1,Rotten,Disappointing.
0,Fresh,They got Spider-Ham right.
0,Fresh,"Herzog ultimately sounds optimistic about humanity's hyperlinked future, even as he highlights the many dangers on the road ahead."
1,Rotten,50 First Dates is another rude and crude stab at romantic comedy with Adam Sandler doing his thing.
0,Fresh,It's a bit too self-congratulatory but does highlight the enormity and impact of staging such a huge event.
1,Rotten,"This film just doesn't stop moving. The camera swirls around every shoot-out, every fight, every conversation. Nothing is still. Everyone shouts. The tone is hysterical and everyone is angry."
1,Rotten,"A gibberish, over-complicated and desperately unfunny feature."
1,Rotten,"Does the excellence of the second part make up for the rancid, unintentionally campy opening? Not for me, though perhaps others would be more forgiving."
1,Rotten,"It's bad enough that Odenkirk can't wring a single laugh out of cameos by funny folks like Jenna Fischer (TV's The Office) or Bill Hader (Superbad), but it's simply astonishing how he squanders Kristin Wiig."
1,Rotten,"""Spenser Confidential"" isn't the type of movie you'd run to pay and see, but fortunately you don't have to. You're already paying for it with your Netflix subscription."

0,Fresh,"Once again, Barnard delivers an intimate take on a difficult subject, raising anticipation for her future work should she decide to scale up."
0,Fresh,"A ""10 Best"" achievement, thanks to writer-director Anthony Minghella's acute interpretation of Patricia Highsmith's novel, a shooting style that wallows in decadence and danger, and a choice cast completely in sync with the stringent demands of the story."
0,Fresh,Not rocket science or much of a rocker. There are plenty of laughs and that's especially true if you know anything about sheep. A great cast has a lot of fun with this one.
0,Fresh,"Whether or not you are familiar with the band or their music, this movie will fill you with a rare kind of musical euphoria. You'll love it."
0,Fresh,"Nothing is too crazed, corny or freakishly florid for Tears of the Black Tiger. Together with cinematographer Nattawut Kittikhun, Sasanatieng dyed his images through digital postproduction, pushing colors to impossible hues of eccentric radiance."
0,Fresh,"A wholesome, feel good tale of a primary school under-dog who dreams of getting to the world paper plane championships in Japan."
1,Rotten,"No who, why or how about the terrorist attacks but plenty on home-life in New Jersey."
1,Rotten,"The inspirational tale becomes just another by-the-numbers, clich-ridden sports film."
1,Rotten,a watered-down hybrid
0,Fresh,"Adorably sweet, charming and filled with love, right down to a ""Ghost Bear"" and fluffy white cats named Snow and Balls, everything is right about The Right Kind of Wrong."
0,Fresh,"A hybrid creation that isn't quite sure which it really is - an original entity or a manufactured automaton. Very much like... well, you get the analogy."
1,Rotten,"... it's a competent, unobjectionable history lesson but Cesar Chavez' legacy needs a more inspired and inspiring telling if it's to get the exposure this crusading figure deserves."

0,Fresh,"A tart, tasty, occasionally overly brutal parable about modern marriage wrapped in an action flick."
0,Fresh,"This polished, comprehensive-feeling film makes clear how much of the work was done by our neighbors to the north."
1,Rotten,One of short series that gave James Karen his place in horror movie history.
0,Fresh,"While 1408 is no classic, it is refreshing to see a horror picture that just wants to do its job rather than prove to its audience how ruthlessly nihilistic it is."
0,Fresh,"Jones handles his fellow actors well, drawing a hard, anguished performance from Pepper and allowing January Jones (no relation) to bring a touching vulnerability to Mike's bored, vapid, baby-doll wife."
0,Fresh,A few great nods to the audience and a buoyant performance by Antonio Banderas help enliven the action.
0,Fresh,"Although the partially true story succumbs to some rather silly Hollywood tropes towards the end, ARGO does an engaging job of burnishing both sides of the Affleck coin."
0,Fresh,"""A Most Wanted Man"" is the rare film that will remain on your mind long after you've left the theater."
1,Rotten,By the numbers relationship drama saved only by Ruffalo's performance and presence.
1,Rotten,Sleuth finds Branagh and Pinter at their absolute worst.
1,Rotten,"The story is moving, and the animation includes some powerful images, although some of the early scenes depicting the suffering of the mice in Russia may be too frightening for younger viewers."
0,Fresh,"For its target audience of children and young teenagers, this Halloween blend of comedy, fantasy, and mild horror is wonderfully effective."
0,Fresh,"Boosted by some of the year's best writing, the extraordinary Marriage Story will merrily break your heart, then solemnly repair it, over and over again."
1,Rotten,"By the time Clarence screams ""wordness to the turdness"", the humor has all but evaporated."
0,Fresh,"As it builds to it's surprising twist, Coco becomes one of the most emotionally satisfying tales from a studio that has built a reputation for emotionally satisfying tales."
0,Fresh,A film that forces you to think about the impossible choices soldiers are forced to make every day.
0,Fresh,The final act hits like a gut-punch.
0,Fresh,"The narrative takes a surprising turn, leading to a troubling and, I think, successful third act. Most uneven pictures have a way of fading to gray in the final lap; this one actually gets better as it goes."
0,Fresh,"Sollima and his cinematographer Dariusz Wolski don't manage to eke out as much tension and visual shock as did the Villeneuve and Deakins combination, but Sicario: Day of the Soldado nevertheless is fluid, efficient, and bloody."
0,Fresh,"Works best for fans of the song or of Christian music in general, but it has enough relatable, not-too-cheesy drama for some crossover appeal."
1,Rotten,Billy is so cliched as to be a photocopy.
0,Fresh,"Matthew Heineman is a documentary filmmaker and his A Private War is a sturdy chronicle of Colvin's fearless life of speaking truth to power, only to be admired because of the unthinkable risks she herself took in order to do so."
1,Rotten,The second half's series of hollow visual spectacles foreground the film as a corporate product.
1,Rotten,"for a Scorsese film, it's missing that touch of greatness that's become synonymous with his name."
0,Fresh,An uneven work of startling sincerity and disarming beauty.
0,Fresh,"""Skyfall"" may be the most intimate Bond film yet."
0,Fresh,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald weighs heavily and can be hard to follow, with very little comic relief. Still it's pretty fantastic -- that is, both pretty and a fantasy."
0,Fresh,Definitely one that repays repeat viewings.
1,Rotten,"There is no momentum in Mockingjay Part 2, as the pacing is terrible."
0,Fresh,"A dry and honorable retelling of events that exists mostly to remind us who she was, and why any potential whistleblowers out there should honor her example."
0,Fresh,"A striking resemblance to ""The Florida Project"" for its motel locale, its class consciousness and above all its cinematic mastery."
0,Fresh,"Though the special effects are at times a little more elaborate than necessary, they don't overwhelm the story's human scale."
0,Fresh,I can't recommend this movie highly enough.
0,Fresh,You'll want to fantasize about what other entirely unique films this young female auteur might dream up? We must believe there's a very bright future ahead for her.
1,Rotten,"""Authors Anonymous"" may be about amateur writers. But its own script needed a professional polish."
0,Fresh,It serves as an enlightening and deeply affecting exercise in empathy for those who've never considered what life must have been like for African-Americans living with inequality a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation called an end to slavery.
1,Rotten,The story is all over the place-to the point where there's really no story at all.
0,Fresh,"None of this sounds terribly promising on paper. In the playing, though, Vanilla works up quite a head of charm."
0,Fresh,"The sheer scope is astonishing, as is the fact that even after nearly three hours we don't want it to end!"
1,Rotten,"Somewhere between Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" and the ""Family Guy"" episode in which Peter Griffin joins the Tea Party lies ""The Purge."" Unfortunately, it's as funny as the former and as thoughtful as the latter."
1,Rotten,"The hybrid of live action and animation is quite handsomely rendered and amusing, as it happens. But its creators overindulge, to the point of crassness, in cliches drawn from action movies and pop culture."
0,Fresh,"I wanted to scream at Osama: Look, your life is at stake, stop crying and climb the tree like a boy!"
0,Fresh,"For once, the summer formula works like a charm: two superstars, a couple of quirky sidekicks, a slew of special effects, a mess o' smart-alecky remarks--yet there's still room for semi-believable characters and a sturdy story."
1,Rotten,Bland and unoriginal but may still amuse young kids.
0,Fresh,"The irony of the enduring appeal of black metal, with its severed pig's heads and upside-down-crosses and screeching vocals, to a population of well-off and well-cared-for young people is not lost on Åkerlund."
0,Fresh,The kind of devastating portrait Capote dispassionately penned about others; we're left with the chilling impression of a frightfully ambitious creature who got exactly what he wanted and was damned by his own answered prayers.
0,Fresh,It's a treat to watch Robert De Niro -- the goodfella supreme -- tweak every gangster role he's ever played.
1,Rotten,"An uneven clash of nicely telegraphed raw sound and timid storytelling, Dakota same sex afterglow in bed with her roller skates still on, and Kristen still in bite this mode, as showerhead pleasuring maven self-entertaining and singing solo in the tub."
0,Fresh,"A nice piece of work, but unfortunately it smacks of bandwagon-jumping following the success of such docs as Winged Migration."
1,Rotten,"There are a couple of laughs, but for me, it's a film that's mainly just going through the motions."
0,Fresh,"A perfectly, magnificently sad film that dwells on the ravages of time while simultaneously celebrating rebirth."
1,Rotten,Great performances by Crudup and Connely can't quite save it from a tedious and meandering script.
1,Rotten,Two straight man inadvertently ending up in a scenario in which they appear to be homosexual can no longer be described as the height of comedic sophistication.
0,Fresh,"Several shots are positively astonishing when you consider that they are in no way manipulated or digitally altered, simply a man on skis flying down a hill with a 40-pound film camera in his hands."
1,Rotten,I kept waiting for the plot to kick in. And waited and waited and waited.
0,Fresh,"Directed and written by first-time feature filmmaker Sean Durkin, Martha is relentless in its unsettled tone, simmering throughout at a feverish level."
0,Fresh,Hotel Mumbai is an outstanding technical achievement in search of a deeper purpose.
0,Fresh,"Talihina Sky unfolds somewhere between fan document and tantalizing expose, but this is a portrait of a bunch of young guys in various states of emotional flux and maturation."
1,Rotten,"The film comes from a video game, and no effort was made to develop the main ideas. This may not be a bother when you're jabbing buttons or yanking joysticks, but it's a dead loss onscreen."
0,Fresh,Moonlight is a story that needed to be told and is achingly beautiful every step of the way.
0,Fresh,"""Still Alice""might sound maudlin, or more on the frequency of a made-for-TV movie than what it is. But this is not only sensitive material handled with tact, it's also sensitive material bolstered and braced by Moore's stunning performance."
1,Rotten,"...a distasteful film...With one absurdly contrived scene after another, one eventually just rolls his eyes and hopes for a quick ending."
1,Rotten,"Shocker represents a low point (perhaps the lowest point) in the career of horror master Wes Craven. With lazy and uninspired writing, in addition to a mishmash of ridiculous plot points, this is a film that is best (and easily) forgotten."
0,Fresh,"Two Lives adds up to the kind of immersive, intelligent entertainment many audiences crave and too rarely get."
1,Rotten,Overwrought.
1,Rotten,The main problem is that the film can't decide whether it wants to be a proper disaster movie or a Dwayne Johnson action vehicle.
0,Fresh,Director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Guy Hibbert have their hearts in the right place in this modern morality play set amidst the ongoing war on terror...
0,Fresh,Poignant archival shots punctuate the importance of these beautifully rendered freedom songs.

1,Rotten,"Despite having excellent production and style, those virtues are overshadowed by the film's excessive length. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"She's Out of My League is not big on originality, yet it scores points for addressing self esteem and body image issues amongst young males."
1,Rotten,"As with the Ice Age sequels, situations may change and characters may come and go, but the central characters and relationships forged in the first film have become static."
0,Fresh,One of the most agonisingly well-observed films about being an adolescent that I've ever seen.

0,Fresh,John Huston has been wanting to make this movie for more than 20 years. It was worth the wait.
1,Rotten,"The movie moves at such an agonizingly stately pace that by the end, side effects be damned, Henry's time-traveling gene starts to look mighty appealing."
0,Fresh,An intriguingly original and attractively shot whodunit that blends a sense of Marilyn Monroe-infused sadness into the mix.

1,Rotten,The Alien franchise: overthinking it since '92.
0,Fresh,"A hilarious, instructive and invaluable time capsule of that touching, idealistic and more than slightly ridiculous period."
1,Rotten,"As for actually understanding and seeing how Han turns ... into the character we already know, these are, apparently, matters for later."
0,Fresh,This is one cool movie!
0,Fresh,They Came Together is smart and incisive satire of the scorched-earth variety.
0,Fresh,Rosewater is at once everything and nothing like what we expect from The Daily Show host Jon Stewart.
1,Rotten,"Either Roman is too pure for the world of this movie or he is not. Mr. Gilroy, perhaps similarly caught between integrity and commercial calculation, gets as lost as his hero."
0,Fresh,"This shows signs of being a lasting work, a film that shifts and changes along with the viewer, upon which all commentary is necessarily provisional."
0,Fresh,"""La Sapienza"" strikes this reviewer as easily the most astonishing and important movie to emerge from France in quite some time."
1,Rotten,"CGI or traditional animation, it makes no difference. The problem with Disney's modern movies is the stories, not the methods they use to bring them to life."
1,Rotten,It's a lazy hero's quest adventure flick where the hero learns little and isn't given much chance to become a hero.
0,Fresh,Essential viewing.
0,Fresh,It's a pity that such an unexpectedly effective thriller is so profoundly undone by a tonally disparate denouement.
0,Fresh,The natural chemistry between the four leads is what gives this material the energy it needs.
0,Fresh,"Herzog has likened Dengler's experience to a Greek tragedy, involving dreams, punishment and redemption."
0,Fresh,"Welcome to Happiness doesn't consistently deliver on the title, but it has its moments."
1,Rotten,Bohemian Rhapsody is well-crafted and exhilarating at times. It doesn't do much to break the mold of a typical biopic.
0,Fresh,"'Brave' is a charming feature that should entice female viewers, and contains enough action and low-brow humor that the male contingent should not feel embarrassed about entering a theater."
0,Fresh,"Bad Times At The El Royale is Tarantino Lite, but not as an insult."
0,Fresh,A surprisingly entertaining romp.
0,Fresh,"Misunderstood by critics and viewers, Nichols' satire of male chauvinism is by turns witty, provocative, funny, and depressing. The film was so controversial in 1971 that it went all the way to the Supreme Court for obscenity charges."
0,Fresh,Good enough to get me really interested in whatever Affleck directs next.
0,Fresh,"I take this whole ""Superman"" thing pretty personally."
0,Fresh,"Sheer technical virtuosity aside, where Miyzaki succeeds most enduringly is in his willingness to grant audiences their most basic intellectual due."
1,Rotten,"Although I laughed at a couple of slapstick gags, the rest of this comedy didn't seem very funny to me."
0,Fresh,"Judd Apatow continues to turn his comedies into meditations on life, sometimes funny and sometimes tragic."
0,Fresh,Extremely well written. Twists around every corner.
0,Fresh,"Aside from some references to misdirection, Jay offers no clue as to how he pulls off illusions with sleight of hand, but he performs them with such panache that you have little choice but to suspend disbelief."
0,Fresh,"It doesn't add up to much, but it's an entertaining journey."
0,Fresh,"Unlike the French Revolution, the film ends with a bang AND a whimper..."
0,Fresh,Another delightful exploration of well-chosen subject matter that's more richly fascinating than you might first expect.
1,Rotten,"The tale goes all sentimental and preachy, which might have worked had the director been Frank Capra. But it isn't; it's Tom Shadyac."

0,Fresh,"From its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale, Martin is a masterfully conducted work."
0,Fresh,"The film does have jokes, but Mooney, channeling the spirit of Peter Sellers, delivers them all without even the slightest hint that he knows he's joking."
1,Rotten,"The Robin Hood of myth and moviedom is for the most part AWOL. Why should we have to wait until the last five minutes to see Crowe crack a smile, let alone split an arrow?"
1,Rotten,"The film, clocking in at just 93 minutes, is not a tough sit by any stretch of the imagination but rather a harmless excuse to pay tribute to a Hollywood legend."
0,Fresh,Ozpetek continues to explore his pet themes in his latest film while toning down the melodramatic excesses and meandering storylines that dragged down his previous work.
0,Fresh,A so-called classic 80's comedy featuring one of Bill Murray's most inspired comic creations.
0,Fresh,"Laughing is easy, loving is not - Benjamin has the emotional dexterity to do both."
1,Rotten,"With Vicodin-sharp timing, Perry wavers from glib to glazed, seeming to openly rue his miscasting as palookaville process server Joe Tyler."
0,Fresh,This is the kind of movie you want to talk about afterward.
1,Rotten,"Like all trifles that use unbearable amounts of saccharine to cover up poor quality, this one leaves a bad aftertaste."
1,Rotten,A classic example of a Hollywood director being struck down by a lethal 'art' attack as soon as he sets foot in Europe.
1,Rotten,"This time, though, the creative group has neglected to build to the kind of giddy, everything-+-the-kitchen-sink climax that made Airplane! such a memorable exercise in anarchy."
1,Rotten,"Despite the $120 million worth of damage, each set piece keeps its giant feet stuck in cement, remaining utterly stagnant despite the multitude of debris."
1,Rotten,"Brazenly, perhaps even purposefully stupid and inept in virtually every facet of the filmmaking process, the newest version of Robin Hood takes ""unnecessary"" to an entirely new level."
0,Fresh,"The Revenant is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu in a nutshell: he makes a bloody 19th century revenge film, and throws in a Star Wars reference. God love him."
0,Fresh,"There are plenty of twists, turns and surprises in this elegant and sometimes witty horror flick. . ."
1,Rotten,"As the body count rises, so may the audience's feeling of indifference."
0,Fresh,"Despite lack of story depth, and very low-tech special and creature effects, this was a pretty entertaining sequel..."
1,Rotten,"It kind of reinforces all of the cliches. At some point, you're not making fun of them, you're doing what all these other movies do. It kind of lost its message by the end of the film, and I was tired."
0,Fresh,"Toy Story 4 is the type of soul-warming cinema experience we didn't know we needed, but are thankful all the same that it exists."
0,Fresh,"You're Next shakes up the genre after a raft of recent contenders, such as the slicker-looking (but less effective) The Purge."
0,Fresh,"Delivers a fair amount of nudity and gore, and a few laughs, and wraps the whole thing up in a brief 77 minutes."
1,Rotten,A prosaic romantic drama by Arie Posin that lifts from Vertigo yet misses everything that made Hitchcock's masterpiece so intriguing.

1,Rotten,[Spells] out each joke for the slow readers and then repeating it for those who can't read at all.
1,Rotten,"The scenes of millions of things happening at once are skillfully made, to be sure, but they're still visually busy to the point of numbness instead of energization. The action has verve but no soul."
1,Rotten,"You can probably see this movie without doing any major damage, but you and yours will have much more fun reading together from the collected works of Dr. Seuss."
0,Fresh,"Midnight Special is a shaggy God story, withholding secrets without being precious, and hardly ever explaining... Visually, dramatically, things stay cool, at a distance or middle distance."

0,Fresh,Slow-paced dog movie teaches lessons on empathy.
0,Fresh,Playing it straight is the secret. Turn down the volume and the picture would resemble any costume drama. Crank it back up again and the air becomes saltier than the Seregovo mine.
0,Fresh,Freaky Friday is a snappy comedy that hits the mark with its wry observations on youth and middle age; in addition it salutes empathy as a bridge-building virtue.
1,Rotten,"Cage may not always be easy on the eyes, but at his best, you can't turn away from him, because you never really know what he'll do next. But here, the actor plays it drab and dour."
0,Fresh,"A combination psychological thriller and love story that offers an engrossing look at memory, yearning, and the toxins of revenge; winner of the 2010 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film."

1,Rotten,"The Children Act could do with a healthy dose of vulgarity, including cakes and ale."
1,Rotten,"After a lively first half-hour, the scenes start to feel heavy, as though Serrano suddenly decided he was actually making a meaningful drama, and the ensuing, halfhearted political satire is like an extra weight on top of that."

0,Fresh,"Spins a web of action, comedy and romance that tops the original."
1,Rotten,A fairly entertaining thriller-melodrama that's undercut by its weak climax and laughably stupid -- and cliched -- ending.
0,Fresh,The only way to make this on target is to love it a little and the only way to make it this hilarious and ultimately so surprisingly touching is to take up Orson Welles' mantra to give the cast another mention.

1,Rotten,"The writing, the acting, the whole thing is done with as little imagination as possible - right down to the fake-out scares and nearly superhuman villain who defies logic at every turn."
0,Fresh,"The low-level desperation and the wavering of consciences, against a working-class backdrop in a slumping neighbourhood, turns this into not just a fairly gripping heist-gone-wrong movie, but a fairly gritty reflection of an anxious, bankrupted America."

0,Fresh,There's just enough mystery to keep the audience guessing.
1,Rotten,"Tends to sometimes rely too much on toilet humor and sex jokes to force a laugh, but sometimes just made me cringe."
0,Fresh,"An affection for the original is certainly not a requirement for enjoying this new ""Valley Girl,"" which finds plenty of appeal in a classic love story template and a litany of '80s hits to keep the energy up."
0,Fresh,"At the center of the film's appeal, though, are its two lead performances and the joy of watching these actors seemingly discover each other in real time."
1,Rotten,"Sporadically funny, but for the most part, Death is just thoroughly modest."

0,Fresh,"Sometimes these types of movies are only as good as their villains, but ""Shazam!"" rises above because the comedy, courage and family elements are super-strong."
0,Fresh,"Here is a definition of star power. An actor who can take a script that is completely predictable and make it seem if not exactly fresh, still somehow charming. So it is with Queen Latifah"

0,Fresh,"The Matador reserves judgment while raising the core issue concerning this traditional ritual: deep, poetic cultural expression or glorified animal cruelty?"
1,Rotten,"A cynical piece of trash that thinks it's smarter than it is. It's what happens when filmmakers mistake ""violent"" and ""unlikable"" as keywords for gritty adult entertainment. None of those traits matter if your movie is just plain stupid."
0,Fresh,Sublime.
0,Fresh,"What makes Old Yeller more than run-of-the-mill Disney is not only the gut-wrenching climax, but also the remarkably well-done uplift of the denouement."

0,Fresh,"The film starts slowly, gathers momentum and flattens audience reservations."
0,Fresh,"Dripping with sincerity and brilliance, [Barry] Keoghan's work is forced to exist in the same universe that gave the specifically untalented Ansel Elgort a Golden Globe nomination for Baby Driver. I can't even."
1,Rotten,"""Silent House"" just isn't scary. The only reason to keep watching is to see if they screw up the tracking shot, and leave the boo boo in without stopping. Ultimately I was bored and didn't really care after the first 15 minutes."
0,Fresh,A sweetly-rendered story that also happens to look terrific.
1,Rotten,"In the end, the story's potential emotional complexity - the idea that we might want to protect a young character while also recognizing her waiting-in-the-wings sexuality - ends up in a bland gray area."
1,Rotten,Laced with such rampant misogyny that the laughs stick in your throat.
0,Fresh,"Lovely, well-acted with great set pieces, but edited into something choppy and less satisfying than one would hope"
1,Rotten,"Rarely likeable on screen, Zeta Jones has a hard time making us empathise with her Ramsay-style ballbreaker."
0,Fresh,"Scott Cooper's intense, downbeat thriller is superbly acted and strongly atmospheric, but the pacing frequently drags and the script feels predictable and over-familiar."
1,Rotten,"But still, story is opaque. We never really get to know any of the characters all that well. Alexander's story would be better as, say, a six hour miniseries..."
1,Rotten,"Nothing deeper than a stale retread, it seems. And this observation comes from a critic who listed the original Charlie's Angels movie as one of the top five films of 2000."
1,Rotten,As boldly original a miscalculation as any you're likely to see.
0,Fresh,"[Director] Crialese's talent for poetic illusion, and for finding the general within the microcosm, is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg."

1,Rotten,"There are, it seems, no visual testimonies remaining, a major problem for any documentary trying to cover to present the full horror of this period."
0,Fresh,"The film ends with an obvious bid for a sequel, and why not? Madagascar and its charming critters deserve an encore."
0,Fresh,"[A] culture clash comprises both the film's lighter and more serious moments, with Poitier's simple, personal struggle over whether to leave or to stay and finish the job giving this small film a backbone of importance."
1,Rotten,"If nothing else, this film makes a persuasive argument for the case that someone needs to get John Milius behind the camera again because someone with his deft cinematic touch is desperately needed more than ever"
0,Fresh,"One doesn't have to be a theater queen to appreciate Camp's humor, but it wouldn't hurt."
0,Fresh,Watching Spidey get Laffy Taffy-ed between responsibility and his own desires is the best version of the character. His universality has always been his Sisyphusian quest to summit Mt. Happiness as the boulder of doing what's right keeps getting heavier.
1,Rotten,"Dialogue has never been Besson's strong suit, and so Valerian is at its best when it's wordless. The Fifth Element director's calling is finding the fun between the operatic and the trashy, with visuals that are both busy and elegant."
1,Rotten,"The people responsible for a hapless load of bunk called If I Were You can only be described as delusional. They think they have made an actual movie, when nothing in it qualifies."
1,Rotten,"Mostly a lot of noise and nonsense, a garish enterprise that almost - though not quite - trivializes the tale."
0,Fresh,"It is a great marriage of artist(s) and repertoire, and might slip past some people as just another talking head music doc. It's actually far more sly than that."
0,Fresh,Shadow Dancer is a quiet film that demands careful attention...
0,Fresh,"As it drags its reluctant antihero down to the depths of a Salo-esque torture prison, Brawl in Cell Block 99 is, quite exquisitely, the ultimate feel-bad prison movie."
0,Fresh,"Despite a glaring lack of context, the movie succeeds on the strength of its principal players."
0,Fresh,It...forces us to reconsider a body of work that is far more expansive than it is often given credit for by changing the template of his previous mob films and foregrounding questions of aging both in its text and its production.
1,Rotten,"... given Ritchie's penchant for flashy, in-your-face twists, we trust all will be revealed in good time. But as ""Revolver"" rolls on -- and on and on and on -- it becomes painfully apparent that Ritchie's firing blanks."
0,Fresh,A nicely balanced story that doesn't take sides.
0,Fresh,My only significant gripe against the movie is that it's not a sequel to Iron Giant.
0,Fresh,"It's a film of vigorous performances and provocative modern resonances, though it sometimes struggles to grapple with a grim, politically ambiguous, 400-year-old play."
0,Fresh,"Olivier Meyrou may keep his distance from his subjects, but staying out of their way doesn't mean losing sight of their troubles."
1,Rotten,"Good Sam is ultimately flimsy, driven by plot and light on character details."
1,Rotten,"We are invited to let the film wash over us, but its disjointed amateurism prevents that from happening with much success."
0,Fresh,"Director Joe Wright, working from a screenplay by Deborah Moggach, has brought both romantic sweep and rich verisimilitude to Austen's story."
0,Fresh,Kudos to graphic novelists Mark Millar and J.G. Jones for coming up with this fun and electric idea in the first place and here's hoping that they can create an ongoing cool environment in which these groovy characters can excel.
1,Rotten,If ITV had made Doctor Who then it would look something like this.
0,Fresh,An exquisite and sense-luscious French film about the great artist and his last muse.
1,Rotten,Do they catch Langdon here? Please. Langdon's historical knowledge allows him to know a secret passageway to take. Every. Single. Time.
0,Fresh,"There's drama, truth, poignancy and joy on display here. As Linklater knows all to well, it's a potent, engrossing combination."
0,Fresh,The impeccable performances of its central quartet and delicious premise that makes A Quiet Place such an exhilarating watch.
0,Fresh,"This is a well-made, observant documentary, with attitude to spare and plenty of justifiable laughs at the expense of its subjects."
1,Rotten,"I hesitate to be this brutal, but there is really no way around it. January Jones was just terrible. She barely moves her face, she seemingly has no emotion, even during a life or death moment, and her scenes with Neeson were just...creepy."
1,Rotten,The Divine Fury is filled with ideas and themes it has no real Intention of exploring. Not even divine intervention can save this film.
0,Fresh,Entertaining documentary.
0,Fresh,"Yes, the deck is stacked, but the converts that Jarecki presents are pretty convincing."
1,Rotten,"The movie flirts with snuff-film torture porn, then has the cast-iron nerve to segue into preachy tut-tutting about what a society of voyeurs we are."
0,Fresh,If it doesn't find an audience then future generations are bound to look back on us as stuck-up prudes.
0,Fresh,"Winterbottom has given plugged-in moviegoers a visceral, mind-bending meta experience, and some good laughs."
1,Rotten,"""I Am Number Four"" has more than a whiff of number two about it..."
0,Fresh,"The parallels aren't immediately obvious and much is left to subtext, but Transit remains one of the most striking films of the past decade or so that captures the ceaseless agony of a life in hiding while the world watches in apathy."
0,Fresh,...a sporadically engaging drama.
0,Fresh,"What Rogen et al. are pointing out is that sometimes, in order to retain some modicum of power, women have to compromise in ways men don't."
0,Fresh,Director John Crowley takes this whimsical film in some nice directions and gets plenty of value from his supporting cast of top senior talent.
1,Rotten,"It's never cheap, but it's also never quite as scary as it thinks it is; the buildups invariably lead to letdowns."
0,Fresh,"In an ideal world, every Hollywood studio suit would be forced to sit through District 9 as part of a curriculum titled ""How to Make a Summer Movie That Delivers."""
0,Fresh,Hilarious and enormously entertaining.
0,Fresh,"Twelve years after Kevin Smith arrived on the film scene with the profane and hilarious Clerks, he returns with a bookend sequel which shows he's grown up as well."
1,Rotten,"Like that holiday fruitcake that nobody wants, here's another stale and joyless Christmas comedy."
1,Rotten,"There are, of course, valuable moments, but it's very difficult to disconnect from this oversized celebration of immaturity which reduces everything to the essential conflict of the Instagram era. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"The satisfyingly high-speed velocity gameplay for which Sonic is so beloved is translated into cringey floss dances, fourth-wall breaking jokes, and pathetic attempts to appear earnest despite constant snark in the screenwriting."
1,Rotten,Hampered by poor comic pacing and gags stolen from better movies.
0,Fresh,"Thanks to Bruckner and Strathairn, who's queasy beyond the call of duty, this is one indie that resonates well beyond the end credits."
0,Fresh,"If it sometimes seems as if we've seen this particular Mel Gibson movie before, well, we haven't seen it for a long time. And it has aged reasonably well."
0,Fresh,"While Teller and Eckhart's adrenaline-fueled presence powers the movie forward with a wonderfully engaging energy, there are flaws aplenty here."
0,Fresh,The visuals and effects that one gets to see on screen are top-notch and the fact that it is a tightly edited script (only 86 minutes long) makes this film an ocular delight to witness.
0,Fresh,This is the best movie I have seen in a long time.
0,Fresh,"Certainly more bittersweet than the 2008 original, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again is a more authentically emotional experience than its predecessor."
1,Rotten,"Complicated by the ways that race, masculinity, and media shape expectations and possibilities in the boxing world."
1,Rotten,"I'd love to say that fans of the first two movies will love this one, but I fall into that group and I was a little disappointed by this outing."
0,Fresh,"It's a slow-burn romantic fairy tale that suddenly turns dark and very violent, but director Nicholas Winding Refn is a master at developing suspense and menace, and every frame of this movie is dripping with both."
0,Fresh,Easily in a different class to pretty much everything else out there in its genre.
0,Fresh,"The most intense scene hinges on spell check. Gun's story is an intriguing tale about the lies governments tell that's presented ably, if a bit too straightforwardly, in Official Secrets."
1,Rotten,"Relegating the film to January and uselessly converting it into ugly, barely-there 3-D so inadequate it might as well be billed as 2 1/4-D, the studio's decisions contradictorily stink of both desperation and defeat."
1,Rotten,"Fans of the first will find some amusement in familiarity, but with such a comically able cast this is a missed opportunity."
0,Fresh,Utterly deranged.
0,Fresh,"Speaks softly but delivers some provocative observations on sexual politics, family pressures, loneliness, single life, love, and romantic fantasies."
0,Fresh,"A sweet and clever crowd-pleaser that works equally well as a comedy and also dramatically, mainly due to the pairing of Hathaway and De Niro."
0,Fresh,'Catch a Fire' is a stirring political thriller with charismatic performances and sure-handed direction by Phillip Noyce.
1,Rotten,"A lame collection of dumber-than-dumb gags, the quality of Big Fat Liar is on par with that of the worst television sit-com gorged to four times its normal size."
0,Fresh,The movie's sanguinary suspense should keep horror fans happily howling; others may watch portions through their fingers.
1,Rotten,"Had Gibson followed the cue of other less self-important variations of The Most Dangerous Game, and cut to the chase more quickly, Apocalypto would have been a far more satisfying experience."
0,Fresh,"For once, a great remake, smartly executed. Great performances and a killing ending that will stay with you forever can't hurt, either."
1,Rotten,"Strictly for fans of the stars and perhaps those with an insatiable curiosity about career low points, the feature is certainly digestible, but rarely memorable."
0,Fresh,"An exciting, often creepy amalgam of ""The Gate"" and 2001's ""Thir13en Ghosts."""
0,Fresh,"While it won't be remembered as great cinema, it is actually a tight piece of film noir."
0,Fresh,"No doubt Affleck's personal experiences hitting the bottle shaped his (strong) performance, but the script doesn't allow him to express anything particularly new or insightful about alcohol addiction"
1,Rotten,This version of The Pied Piper is not exactly told as a children's fable.
0,Fresh,"Goon: The Last of the Enforcers brings together a phenomenal cast, produces many funny-as-hell gags, and continues the spirit of the original - and that's enough to keep you in the game."
0,Fresh,"Working from a deft script by Delia Ephron, director Ken Kwapis labors hard so that guys won't cringe (too much) as four teen girls, of different body types, pass along the same pair of lucky jeans during a summer of love and loss."
0,Fresh,"The Good Shepherd is drama at its best, a complex meditation on the freedoms we take for granted and proof that just a little information about how we maintain them is way too much."
0,Fresh,"This is a fabulous documentary about a man and the times that were, and hopefully still are, a-changin'."
1,Rotten,"Only a multilevel chase sequence involving Surly and some glowing-eyed street rats has any real kinetic excitement, and the supporting characters lack visual distinction."
0,Fresh,"With a unique and clever plot twist on the zombie trope, an important place in film history and some badass swordplay, Blood Quantum is one to watch out for."
0,Fresh,"...a movie that wants to be great, tries to be great, and on a certain level is great... though perhaps a tad too slick for its own good."
1,Rotten,"This animated adaptation of the Japanese comics characters and concepts appears to have been cobbled together from parts of other, better movies."
0,Fresh,"It's always compelling; you feel grateful, watching, that this story is being told at all."
1,Rotten,There are too many tricks and there's too little compelling plot here.
0,Fresh,"Inventive, even romantic Woody Allen."
0,Fresh,Makhmalbaf's highly original new film is a tragicomic drama about the toppling of a dictator. The twist here is that the drama is seen from the perspective of the dictator himself.
0,Fresh,This is one of Disney's best.
0,Fresh,It starts slow but the film picks up with spectacular action sequences that save the film from a very thin script. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"In conceptualizing how it feels to be inescapably pursued by something that's embedded in your culture, 2015's It Follows is a much better sequel to The Ring."
1,Rotten,"A typically soulless Bruckheimer film rife with the dazzling visual flourishes of a Ridley Scott film -- in essence, a movie that plays like a two-and-a-half hour television commercial for itself."
1,Rotten,"Whilst developments are telegraphed well in advance, a late revelation proves too ridiculous to stomach even within the melodramatic confines, consigning otherwise average escapism to the realm of the bewildering and bland."
1,Rotten,"Compared with Carroll's brilliantly topsy-turvy logic, however, it all seems very muddled, and the original's whimsical charm is definitely missing."
0,Fresh,"With Jersey Girl, [Smith] stopped fooling around, finally got his act together and made a real film. For once, he deserves the moniker 'filmmaker.'"
0,Fresh,Soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film. What's left is a rich stew of longing.
0,Fresh,"Adam remains watchable thanks to credible performances from its two leads, but it fails to satisfy on an emotional level and could have been a lot better."
1,Rotten,"Jennifer Lopez has never looked better or acted worse than in The Back-Up plan, a formulaic chick flick that conveys a deep distrust, if not downright hatred, of child-bearing women."
1,Rotten,"When anything's possible, nothing matters."
0,Fresh,"The entire script is a mishmash: funny, droll, and anxiety producing, just like daily life in many Jewish families."
1,Rotten,An interesting but frustrating mess.
0,Fresh,"The filmmakers behind the sweet-hearted, mostly well-made family film Flicka know their target audience. In fact, they cater to it at the expense of the original book."
0,Fresh,"If Jarmush's atmospheric, blood-and-bohemians style is your thing, you might not want to leave."
1,Rotten,This is amusing for about three minutes.
0,Fresh,Somewhat engaging.
0,Fresh,"Smart and engaging, Zathura is one big ""Check Mate"" to Jumanji, a movie it trumps in every way."
0,Fresh,"Ff you want to know what a comedy that really ""sticks the landing"" looks and plays like, here you go."
1,Rotten,"I suppose the relationship is Oedipal or primal or something or other, but mostly it's just an excuse for Dolan to stage a series of gaudy shout-fests."
0,Fresh,"Tina Gordon Chism's reverse 'Big' works thanks to the charisma of stars Marsai Martin, Issa Rae, and Regina Hall."
1,Rotten,They really don't step in anything that hasn't been wallowed in before.
1,Rotten,"Herzog has unique flair, but it's out of synch with the genre. As for Cage, he is a flailing madman and the only polite thing to do is look away."
0,Fresh,"Cameron reconstructs life aboard in the shape of living tableaux of passengers and crew, seen in spectral mode, eating, drinking, dancing or promenading among the watery remnants of their vessel. It is done with finesse and, oddly, is deeply touching."
0,Fresh,"To be an audience-grabber at the heart is not always a pointless concept, and here the director and writers prove that the formula still has a few kicks to it."
1,Rotten,"Even noisier, more incoherent, and more like watching someone play a shooter-style video game than its predecessors."
0,Fresh,"Sometimes with horror movies, it's all about tone."
1,Rotten,Zoolander began as a television sketch and ideas are clearly starting to run thin.
1,Rotten,"Plunges full-on into wall-to-wall CG, the digital effects dwarfing the human heroics in a mess of blurry, choppy images"
1,Rotten,"If anything, this reminds me how much I'd like to see both Anderson and Biel - hell, even Mamet - in a better film than this."
0,Fresh,"James D. Cooper treats Lambert & Stamp as the cinematic equivalent of a rich oral history, letting the principal players talk, often at length, about their experiences."
1,Rotten,"While there are are striking moments throughout, there's also a great deal which is simply corny or laborious, such as most of the material about Shakur's dealings with record labels."
1,Rotten,"Katherine Heigl carries 27 Dresses when all else fails, which it does with great regularity."
0,Fresh,"Filmed in black and white with a light, jazzy score courtesy of Gruff Rhys, Set Fire To The Stars offers a slice of biographical remembrance without a great deal of substance."
0,Fresh,"This beautiful film plays out at the speed of life, evoking memories of To Kill A Mockingbird, with brilliant performances that dazzle us quietly."
0,Fresh,"Border argues that the full integration of the other is not always possible, that the existence of another involves living with differences that are not going to be filed. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"[There is] very obvious, and somewhat jarring use of some very underwhelming CGI effects in a number of key scenes. However, the tremendous performances and the film's unique tone more than make up for this technical misjudgement."
0,Fresh,"It's very unclear if we'll ever see a sequel to Early Man but either way, Park and Aardman have once again made a great and amusing family film."
1,Rotten,Writer-director Michael Dowse's film whizzes all over the place like a gaudy kite.
0,Fresh,It all makes for a graciously subdued trip down the burlesque runway...in a documentary that audiences will likely be expecting to concentrate more on other parts of the body.
0,Fresh,Fascinating and beautiful and brutal
0,Fresh,"With ""Fish Tank,"" [Andrea Arnold]'s made her best film so far, and in the process, reinforced just how glad I am I didn't have any daughters."
1,Rotten,"There's little insight here, but rather a generic cat-and-mouse scenario that progressively gets more far-fetched."
0,Fresh,"Glodell created the film's distinctive, hazy look by homebrewing his own camera rigs and attachments, and the result is a film that looks like no other in recent memory."
0,Fresh,The Enterprise is losing speed.
1,Rotten,A crime drama posing as a mystery.

0,Fresh,Group mentality reaches for one lie after another in Iranian tale
1,Rotten,"As Sorkin's loquacious heroine engaged in rapid-fire exchanges with her whip-smart lawyer (Idris Elba), I could almost hear the clickety clack of the writer's keyboard."
1,Rotten,"It is, for anyone who loved the original films, an abomination."
0,Fresh,"Finds Lee fully honed in on message with one of the most timely, engaging and thought-provoking films of his career."
1,Rotten,One has to consider that the film's problems -- and they are numerous -- may be the product of the franchise's runaway popularity.
0,Fresh,[Joaquin Phoenix] thrives under the weight and pressure of portraying the most iconic comic book villain of all time.
0,Fresh,"It's warm in spurts, intermittently humorous, but always eye candy, creating a successful new take on old material."
1,Rotten,"How Do You Know is a slight and predictable tale of modern day love, padded with subplots about father-son bonding and undeclared love."
0,Fresh,"the intensity of Murphy and Delaney's performances is shattering... 'Wind' never loses sight of the fact that sometimes a victim's wounds may be invisible to the eye, but every bit as painful as a stabbing..."
0,Fresh,Seemingly rambling about without a destination in mind at the end of the film you realize you have traveled somewhere.
0,Fresh,"Brutal without turning exploitative, the result is harrowing and heartbreaking."
0,Fresh,[Joe] Cornish's attempt at merging a classic legend with our modern day issues is successful.
0,Fresh,Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol could very well be the series' best installment.
1,Rotten,A lightweight outing heavy on convention.
0,Fresh,Bucolic scenes of men at rest in beautiful wild landscapes and families gathered over meals in manors and homesteads are shattered by battles...
0,Fresh,"A pleasant enough diversion, but it doesn't pack the wry punch of Cusack's classic romantic comedy, 1989's Say Anything."
1,Rotten,"Even documentaries need dramatic tension; this one is comprised solely of contented people being informed that their lives are tickety-boo. After a while, you can't take any Moore."
1,Rotten,"Much of what happens, regardless of whether its supposed to be touched by magic, seems patently phony."
1,Rotten,Mockingjay should have ended last year instead of being split in half for reasons involving only the box office.
1,Rotten,"An effective history lesson, but not nearly riveting enough to be as entertaining as it is earnest."
0,Fresh,A worthy successor to the first movie with exactly the right combination of jokes and action that it's not likely to disappoint too many people.
0,Fresh,"The John Wick movies accomplish what Hong Kong action flicks did a quarter-century ago, seducing bloodthirsty (predominately male) audiences into appreciating an exquisitely choreographed modern ballet."
0,Fresh,"A smart, hilarious and affec tionate spoof of detective movies -- and Hollywood -- starring the inspired team of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer."
0,Fresh,"Told with humor, and with the obvious support of the NFL, ""Draft Day"" is just the film to see before the real draft starts on May 8."
0,Fresh,One of the best comedies of the 1980s; Moore's signature role
0,Fresh,"Not only is Perry in tune with his audience as always, he's unquestionably growing as a cinematic artist."
0,Fresh,Exquisite... Listen closely to Horton Hears a Who! You might be surprised by what you hear.
0,Fresh,"...but pardon me if I shoot the messenger (ooh, the horrible pun!) for his propagandist approach to the subject that comes close to crippling his credibility."
1,Rotten,"Piranhas feels a bit like a teen movie that just happens to have a Cammora backdrop, rather than a serious, nuanced drama about the paranza system - essentially, the grooming of underage kids as drug runners and Mafia footsoldiers."
0,Fresh,The world of the fanciful fable looks particularly vibrant this time with its signature blend of realism and fantasy. It is a pleasure to watch these fairy tale folk be themselves -- yet again.
0,Fresh,"Downsizing is Alexander Payne's most ambitious movie, but that also might be his worst enemy."
1,Rotten,"Basquiat appears to be a slippery subject, not unlike Bob Dylan, who is very difficult to decipher."
1,Rotten,"Instead of building to a crescendo, the movie trails off. By the end, serious-minded adult moviegoers may find themselves longing for another product from the well-oiled sequel machine."
0,Fresh,One of the best laugh til you cry comedies of the last decade.
0,Fresh,"Generously exciting, In the Line of Fire is mercifully free of that artificial energy that makes so many new movies look as if they were created with steroids."
1,Rotten,A dire stewardess comedy that's the movie equivalent of airline food.
0,Fresh,"It's Hudson who owns Dreamgirls; her delivery of ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" is worth a standing ovation -- or at least a recount on American Idol -- all by itself."
1,Rotten,"Graynor confidently graduates from best-friend roles to a witty, wise-cracking and hilariously sexy leading lady."
0,Fresh,"Director Tarsem Singh Dhandwar slathers things with eyecatching visuals - luscious CGI effects, vertiginous camera angles, a treacly amber glow - and keeps every frame watchable, however foolish and stilted the utterances emerging from people's mouths."
1,Rotten,"Director Kurt Wimmer claims to have written Ultraviolet specifically with lead actress Milla Jovovich in mind. No, I don't know what Jovovich did to deserve this either . . ."
1,Rotten,The illogical script by Gary Scott Thompson is desperate to keep us guessing but clueless as to how. Every tin of red herring in the store gets ripped open.
0,Fresh,"If films like this stop being funded altogether in favour of crowd-pleasers rather than crowd-challengers, we're damned. That's your most plausible dystopian future, folks."
1,Rotten,"It's silly teenage ""Revenge of the Nerds"" fun. And it's spirited."
0,Fresh,"A haunting, strange and lyrical narrative on one man's spiritual and political resurrection from the darkest corners of his consciousness. First Reformed brims with insights on anger, guilt, faith and personal autonomy."
0,Fresh,"A sharp-edged, funny, original, and often thoughtful approach to the connection between art to life."
0,Fresh,Engaging and entertaining.
1,Rotten,"With a plot lacking no urgency, Shrek 3 is a well-animated film containing a few standout, but ultimately throwaway sequences that don't do enough to sustain our interest."
1,Rotten,Easily the weakest installment in the popular kids' series...one can only hope that the subtitle is more than just a reference to the virtual reality game at the center of the very thin plot.
0,Fresh,Leave it to a European sophisticate to make an inspirational film about America's demon prince of sleaze.
1,Rotten,Adds nothing much to the genre of family dramas.
1,Rotten,"Most are exercises in sickening bad taste, with an emphasis on human bodily functions."
1,Rotten,Hemsworth's emotionless performance (and a murky subplot about his wife's inexplicable descent into madness) mean that this scattershot Western misses its mark.
1,Rotten,"it's all very slickly realised... but the sheer number of mood swings, double crosses and narrative twists eventually becomes exhausting, while making it impossible to engage with the protean players or to care much who eventually comes up diamonds."
0,Fresh,A joyous romp whose forced jollity is only occasionally wearing.
0,Fresh,"With her sharp wit and a verbal maturity which far exceeds her emotional age, Nadine feels like Juno written by an actual teen rather than an ironic hipster."
0,Fresh,"Iron Man never feels like a laboured prologue that's simply laying the groundwork for further instalments. It's a zippy, action-packed adventure in its own right, boasting top-drawer special effects and some cracking action sequences."
1,Rotten,"The vibes, here, are all wrong, and Dangerfield's unique timing is disrupted in most scenes."
0,Fresh,Spider-Man: Far From Home has more than a webshooter up its sleeve.
1,Rotten,"Overblown Hollywood enhancing, embellishing, riffing, and too-much-ing on a known classic, with every imaginable thing + the kitchen sink, and CGI on top of CGI. Like too much Christmas candy, it'll make your teeth hurt."
1,Rotten,Cooper shows significant promise in his directorial debut. Let's hope he finds the funding to direct again but with better material next time.
1,Rotten,"Based on a contrived premise to begin with, romantic ghost comedies are a tricky genre, calling for inspired writing, light touch, charming performances, all of which are in short supply here."
0,Fresh,A stunningly-made film guaranteed to send hypochondriacs into a frenzy.
0,Fresh,"Gothic in tone, and unapologetically downbeat, ""Winter's Bone"" is a film that turns over a rock of backwoods American reality and studies the beautiful and ugly things that crawl there with equal interest. It's the strongest drama of the year, so far."
0,Fresh,It's Washington's Everyman who keeps the film honest.
0,Fresh,The scariest movie of its day
0,Fresh,"There's something magical about conversations that morph into songs, especially considering that the typical dancing that accompanies such skits is refreshingly truant."
1,Rotten,Merde that meets the eye.
1,Rotten,This movie has no raison d'tre. The disjointed editing and shallow interviewing doesn't tell enough about any of the three to learn what makes them tick.
0,Fresh,"Stunning animation and big-screen thrills, but be warned that this is a much scarier movie than the animated 1967 version."
1,Rotten,"Taken individually, each scene has interesting qualities. However, as a whole, director Jeffrey Porter fails to bring it all together."
1,Rotten,"Jason Bourne is more indecipherable and unformed than ever, with Damon not given much more to do than shoot, brawl, bleed and run."
0,Fresh,"...a good motion picture despite its shallow, often sentimental overtones."
0,Fresh,"Sergio Leone's swan song is an undisputed masterpeice, a self-reflexive crime-gangster epic with towering performances from De Niro and Tuesday Weld."
0,Fresh,"From her terrific debut feature River of Grass through Meek's Cutoff and Wendy and Lucy, Reichardt has given us incomplete, quietly suffering women who feel their way into change."
0,Fresh,"While [it] is a mixed bag, it's a fun, occasionally raucously funny satire..."
0,Fresh,Sideways is non-mainstream pretentiousness done right
0,Fresh,One of the most unique stories I've seen in years
1,Rotten,A movie that serves up what its debauched subject would never have countenanced -- sanitized smut with a moral attached.
0,Fresh,"Director and cast are smart enough to not shy away from a romantic comedy that can only end, if not badly, then at least in the melancholy tears of lessons hard won."
1,Rotten,Making a comedy that celebrates binge drinking and cretinous behavior isn't a crime against nature. Making one that's as brutally unfunny as Beerfest is.
0,Fresh,This is one beguiling ride.
1,Rotten,It isn't insultingly bad; it's just incompetent.
1,Rotten,He's an interesting character... but I can't use that same adjective for the film itself.
1,Rotten,Watching Hawke investigate strange goings-on night after night without turning on one light in the house becomes unintentionally comical.
1,Rotten,"Around halfway through, I was itching to see how much time remained."
0,Fresh,As smart as it is side-splittingly silly.
0,Fresh,"In the race to achieve unadulterated fourth-wall breakage, Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie is the new pack leader."
0,Fresh,A movie of this sort could easily wear out its welcome early. Yet Ferrell and company transform the one joke concept into a surprisingly subtle train of gentle jabs at an entire defunct school of filmmaking.
1,Rotten,If 'The Ghost Dimension' confirms anything it's that better effects don't mean squat when you're fresh out of ideas.
0,Fresh,"It's complex and daring, with a focus on three women's relationships amid devious scheming, profane dialogue and political threats reminiscent of ""Veep"" and slapstick that would make the Three Stooges proud."
0,Fresh,"[The Last Jedi] is one of the best-looking movies of the year, and crafts images never before seen in a Star Wars film. I'd definitely recommend seeing it in the cinema."
1,Rotten,"""Social media will kill you."" Yeah. We get it. Again."
0,Fresh,"Burnham doesn't revel in Kayla's misery or exploit her for shock value. She does have her own share of heartache, but plenty of moments of happiness too."
0,Fresh,"For a hardcore fan of his music and his life, it rings true."
0,Fresh,Its three leads certainly deserve consideration for their artfulness in being able to infuse it with intimations of quality.
1,Rotten,It's a real shame Every Secret Thing didn't work out because all the ingredients are there.
0,Fresh,"...a respectable workhorse, committed to its ethos, ruggedly constructed, and well-acted..."
0,Fresh,A very satisfying picture.
0,Fresh,If your experience of having an alcoholic parent with bipolar disorder isn't particularly rosy then this film may not resonate with you.
1,Rotten,"His journey towards peace of mind involves lots of lyrical philosophising, which presumably comes straight from the film's source novel, by Anne Michaels, and doesn't lend itself to dramatisation, despite Dillane's typically intelligent performance."
1,Rotten,"Charting the journey of a ruthless lobbyist who develops a conscience, ""Miss Sloane"" is a shallow but lively thriller which becomes undermined by its makers' misplaced belief in the profundity of their topical tale."
0,Fresh,"Ridiculous and surprisingly likable -- sweet, silly and light as a soap bubble."
0,Fresh,"A decent, mid-list spy thriller, suspended somewhere between le Carr and Bond but with a budgetary austerity in keeping with UK government spending cuts that keeps it out of the real high-stakes game."
0,Fresh,"Hands down, the best thing about this film is T-Bone Burnett's brilliant score and the songs by Jack White and Gabriel Yared."
1,Rotten,"Este primeiro grande tropeo na carreira de Garca embaraa pelo roteiro batido e pela falta de ritmo da narrativa, no sendo salvo nem mesmo pelo charme de Hathaway."
1,Rotten,"By the time the film moves toward its conclusion and the gross-out factor really starts to rise, any semblance of even an exploitation story has fallen away like so many lopped-off limbs."
1,Rotten,"It's not a bad notion for a satiric comedy and this one begins well, but then veers entirely out of hand until it's as over-inflated as its own Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come and as funny as a mugging."
0,Fresh,I would like to watch more of Eddie and Venom bantering about their common character defects and possibly eating people.
1,Rotten,"For all its clever quirkiness, the end product seems flat and over-thought, which isn't to say it's a bad first step for this ambitious novice director, just a long way from something that will set the world on fire."
1,Rotten,Predictable action sequences & lazy character development add up to an all too blatant cash in at the box office
0,Fresh,"When dealing with a subject so shallow and petty, it's pretty hard to dig as deep as Coppola tries to. If you're looking for profundity, you're not going to find it in the Hollywood Hills."
0,Fresh,"The idea is to be erotic, seductive, but often, through Wiseman's unforgiving lens, the effect is more anatomical, aloof, amusing."
0,Fresh,"This director does have a flair for rhythmically intense set-pieces, and his whole film justifies its existence when the bullets start flying."
1,Rotten,"Even if you care, it'll be out on video soon."
0,Fresh,"Maybe if PETA tried being funny instead of comparing eating meat to the Holocaust, they'd have a bigger following."
0,Fresh,"And now Phantom Thread is a half-harrowing, half-tender chamber piece about the nature of love that also pokes, amusingly, at the supposed importance of the Great Artist."
1,Rotten,"Relies way too much on cheap, nerve-jangling sound effects and musical stings to juice up the film's tepid, PG-13 proceedings."
0,Fresh,In the Valley of Elah is the first great movie about the stateside aftermath of the Iraq War and should be considered a companion piece to Hal Ashby's post-Vietnam opus Coming Home.
1,Rotten,"As a piece of cinema, this film is dispensable, but in Delevingne, it may have given birth to a new star."
1,Rotten,"An overplotted conglomeration of events that I found diverting, yet meaningless and emotionally uninvolving."
0,Fresh,"Unlike so many horror films, You're Next doesn't cheat with the script for the sake of the action."
1,Rotten,"No one should mistake Firestorm for a ""quality"" motion picture. It's not, and it wasn't designed to be."
1,Rotten,"There are laughs, sure, with Brooks' unabashed moocher coming up with many of the film's best lines... but the overall results are distinctly patchy and at 133 minutes, the film is at least half an hour too long."
0,Fresh,"When it's working, Tag is a reassuring reminder that age is no governor on immaturity or vulgarity."
1,Rotten,"After paying homage to everything that came before, this ""Star Wars"" ending is a too-safe landing of a massive pop-culture starship, and a spectacular finale that misses a chance to forge something special."
1,Rotten,"The whole film, written and directed by Mark Herman, feels like watching concrete set."
1,Rotten,"""Promised Land"" offers an experience that's alternately amusing and frustrating, full of impassioned earnestness as well as saggy sections."
0,Fresh,"The Holocaust scenes are wrenching, the past-meets-present dialectics less so."
0,Fresh,The one remake to rule them all!
0,Fresh,"The moral ends up muddier as a result, but the film's diversity ends up making it more of a muse-worthy thinkpiece than a conventional melodrama might have been."
1,Rotten,"The film lacks dash to the dialogue, excitement to the set-pieces, and enduring creepiness to the malevolent arachnids. Nothing in Guardians of the Tomb has a decent bite."
0,Fresh,Educational and hilarious. The quintessential Laughton role!
0,Fresh,"It's the do-nothing, go-nowhere moments that make Once Upon a Time such a treat, watching Rick and Cliff tool around Hollywood in their cream-coloured Cadillac Coupe deVille."
1,Rotten,"Thanks For Sharing did not leave me wanting more but less. And demanding a cinematic court order that comedy and drama live apart for a while, or at least until they can share the screen in harmony."
1,Rotten,"Ambitious, but its lack of character in order for its dumbed down story make this adaptation a major dud."
0,Fresh,"It's a small movie, often to a fault. But every time you're about to write it off as ""Generic Grief Indie #451,"" it surprises you."
0,Fresh,The rewards are rich and unforgettable.
0,Fresh,"For first-time screenwriter Wingate and Segal, in only his second feature (2004's ""The Last Run), it's impressive work - they never overplay the pity card, opting for insight into the complexities of growing up instead."
1,Rotten,"At a Thursday-night screening meant for the diehards, one man was loudly sawing logs by the 60-minute mark and the final ""shock"" stinger was met largely with laughter. Para-snore-mal activity, indeed."
0,Fresh,Small but affecting drama...a deceptively simple but emotionally rich tale [with] a remarkable lead performance.
1,Rotten,"There are glimmers of good filmmaking in Money Buys Happiness, but the main characters are generally unlikeable."
0,Fresh,"The film builds, out of an outlet for discussing the tragedy of one family, into an emotionally, intellectually, and aesthetically complex work of essay and memoir."
0,Fresh,"A witty, spare, beautifully performed political comedy."
1,Rotten,"It's hard to make the case that any of this means anything, or is even supposed to ..."
0,Fresh,"Close resembles no man I've ever seen, or woman either. She's the personification of fear-the fear of being seen through, seen for what she is."
1,Rotten,"If you thought Godzilla or Kong: Skull Island had too many humans and too little sweet carnage, then Rampage is for you!"
1,Rotten,"Filmmaking for Allen appears to have settled into little more than personal habit, like shaving, dining or playing clarinet once a week with his jazz band. The result has for some time been a hit-and-miss process."
0,Fresh,"A good, sprawling yarn that covers a lot of miles and a lot of years."
0,Fresh,"The veteran director brings the full force of his filmmaking knowledge to bear on proceedings, reckoning again and again with the weight of American history and Hollywood's interpretation of it."
1,Rotten,"It's a hairy true story, one ripe for the über-masculine film treatment, which is exactly what director Alejandro González Iñárritu has given us in the grueling The Revenant, as much a survival story for the audience as it is for the hero."
0,Fresh,"Mel looks a lot more grizzled, of course, than when he first started playing his hair-trigger hotheads but he still oozes charisma. And when it comes to the film's scorching shootouts, he's still got the live-wire energy too."
0,Fresh,"""Ready Player One"" is an engrossing thrill ride that feeds off of your pop culture nostalgia."
0,Fresh,Hunt for the Wilderpeople is ultimately disarming in its innocent sincerity.
0,Fresh,"Your final affection for this literary treat of sorts is how well you accept the finale, which is touching, and intellectually potent, yet possibly one depressant too many."
0,Fresh,Darned entertaining.
1,Rotten,A second-rate one-upping.
1,Rotten,"MIB: I is an OK summer science fiction adventure movie. Trouble is, it's not a good Men in Black movie."
0,Fresh,The director has elicited an excellent performance from his central actor Kravchenko.
0,Fresh,"Still Alice works and, at times, with assured, depressing clarity."
0,Fresh,"It's the Cold War redux, but with the Enemy now everywhere."
1,Rotten,"Ups the self-parody so much that it's practically a Wayans Brothers spoof, albeit with fewer jokes."
1,Rotten,It at least has some kitsch value for its insistence that Sean Astin can be a hard nosed action hero.
0,Fresh,"While We're Young is a mostly enjoyable movie, but what it's trying for is wisdom, and that's a quality that Baumbach doesn't earn."
1,Rotten,"Unlike that medal that eluded Pitsenbarger's memory for decades, ""The Last Full Measure"" doesn't do its hero justice."
1,Rotten,"Broken Lizard's Club Dread spoofs a genre already spoofed out, the slasher film, and does it badly"
0,Fresh,Bong elevates every scene with his unbelievably assured filmmaking.
1,Rotten,"fails to provide insight into the porn industry, filmmaking, or basic human behavior."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately feels affected in its aspirations toward making some profound statement about self-abasement and sacrifice, making one feel like rejecting the whole thing despite some striking individual moments."
1,Rotten,"Borrowing heavily from leftfield genre spin-offs like True Romance, it's no wonder this misfire was on the shelves for so long."
0,Fresh,"A sturdy, hero-worshipping picture that underplays the boasting which made Pre less sympathetic in last year's version by Hollywood Pictures."
0,Fresh,"If Allen hasn't quite figured out the social landscape of England yet, he does know what he wants to talk about: Fate, or more commonly, Luck."
0,Fresh,More than the sum of its shaky-cam parts.
0,Fresh,"A shiny, caged beast of a film that delivers on its every promise."
1,Rotten,"In theory, it had all the signs of a ripe Mirren performance, but she's undone by a weak script that leaves her flailing like an Olympic swimmer in a pool full of jelly."
1,Rotten,"The kind of careful, listless adaptation that makes a critic want to rave at length about the wonderful novel on which it's based."
0,Fresh,"Best of all is Anderson's sense of character, expressed in dialogue that never strains for effect and in his expert handling of a first-rate quartet of actors."
0,Fresh,A gripping documentary that pivots on brutal familial homophobia ...

0,Fresh,"Because she's so internal, the shtick threatens to grow dour and whiny. But mostly there's a mystery and an acknowledgement that there's not always a concrete reason why."
1,Rotten,"All in all, The Rise of Skywalker is more like the fall of the saga and everything it once stood for."
0,Fresh,"Makes you remember the brilliance of 'A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back', but also makes you curious for what may come with Episodes VIII and IX. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"It remains a classic of surrealism, packed with disturbing images and sly (some would say 'perverse') humor."
0,Fresh,"Kim has a very specific wringer he intends to usher his pawns through and a particular course he's plotted to it. Consequently, a complex, troubling character study slowly becomes a borderline conventional narrative."

0,Fresh,The scene in which Chan beats up David Pearse and Michael McElhatton through three floors of a Belfast B&B in itself justifies your attention.
0,Fresh,"Rain is a very talented slaughterer. He could kill you with a pair of tweezers, a hair dryer, two bananas, whatever. Be glad he's a good ninja."
0,Fresh,"Hong Kong action maestro Johnnie To takes his genre filmmaking savvy to the mainland in Drug War, a nail-biter that's actually quite light on action but so well-scripted and shot, it's nonetheless edge-of-your-seat material."
0,Fresh,"The imagery is intense, brutal and disturbing. Volker Bertelmann's percussive heavy score is powerful, adding effectively to the build up of tension and fear."
1,Rotten,"Despite the bucktoothed charm of the truck named Mater and a plot that pays lip service to alternative fuels, the John Lasseter-directed animation does not turn the lemon into lemonade."
1,Rotten,"If Chan has toned down the stunts, Tucker has pumped up the volume on his comic duties to the point where it seems his high-pitched whine could break glass."

1,Rotten,misguided attempt to blend the hard-boiled cop story with a goofiness that doesn't quite catch the requisite exuberant abandon of camp
0,Fresh,"""I Give It a Year"" is a smart farce that would make Hugh Grant and his fans proud."
0,Fresh,Some movies present an idealized view of marriage and family; others seem eager to debunk it. Mira Nair's exuberant art-house crowd-pleaser takes the third way.
1,Rotten,A jumbled mix of on-the-nose comedy set pieces and contrived emotional threads that squander any potential within Sex Tape's entertaining premise.
0,Fresh,"Like last year's Up from the same company, Pixar, this film tickles the funny bone but also brings a tear to the eye."
0,Fresh,"Frankly, I would urge viewers to see this film, if for no other reason, than for the final scene. It's the kind of scene that involuntarily quickens your heart, makes your jaw fall open, and catches your breath."
0,Fresh,"While this stop-motion-animated fantasy film might be a little much for some really sensitive young viewers, it's visually inventive and captivating."
0,Fresh,"It works phenomenally well, leaving you thoroughly engaged rather than shaking in your boots."

1,Rotten,"The Winchester Mystery House deserves a little better than ""Winchester."""
0,Fresh,"The film is poorly directed, but it deals with a rare issue, picture brides circa 1918, and is made by an insider, an Asian-American, which is a +."
1,Rotten,Hess has traded the deadpan shtick of his debut for the kind of insult-and-injury farce that wouldn't be out of place in a Kevin James production.
1,Rotten,"Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians, of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour."
0,Fresh,"A pitch against genetic modification of animals, ancient or otherwise? An indictment of corporate greed at any cost to others? To the extent it's seen that way, the purposes of entertainment override the ""messages."""
1,Rotten,"A blandly good looking, no frills, reasonably competent and occasionally emotional Message Movie, one whose message favors a color-blind approach to race relations, one designed to work entirely in favor of the desires of white people."
0,Fresh,A loopy work of imagination that never fails to be entertaining.
1,Rotten,The torments endured by the Chinese don't need Lu's lapel-grabbing tactics...
1,Rotten,"Southland Tales is a monumentally bad film, a landmark in 21st century cinematic awfulness. There's no real meaning to be found here; it's all signifiers for half baked ideas that Richard Kelly never managed to turn into anything worthwhile."
0,Fresh,"For Scorsese the door to the past is never closed. Hugo does not so much revisit the past as reveal that it is still alive, elaborately disguised as the present."
0,Fresh,It will be interesting to watch how skeptics will deal with Gore's bad news on the environment without making themselves look very small.
1,Rotten,Absurdly contrived...
1,Rotten,"Starting full of dark promise, Lights Out becomes a mechanical, family action film made with kid gloves. It left me begging to be scared."
0,Fresh,"Vikander doesn't have much to play, script-wise, but she makes a tough, appealing action star ..."
0,Fresh,"Don't hold the movie's utter unoriginality and brainlessness against it. A few laughs, a few popcorn-jolting scares -- what more do you want on a hot summer night?"
0,Fresh,"The film, directed by Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan, does a brilliant job of putting his 2000 run for president in context -- to show how consistent it was with everything he has stood for in his remarkable career."
1,Rotten,"The TV show excels with its short squad-car bursts of random inanity; here, the plot -- stretched out to 84 minutes -- feels like a dime bag tossed aside by a fleeing perp."
0,Fresh,"Though neither subtle nor particularly original, Gens' spin on the meat-movie classic has both nightmarish energy to spare."
0,Fresh,"To the Stars seems downcast, at first glance, but it serves as a gentle, lovely reminder that one true friendship, even forged amid adversity, can be enough to keep you looking skyward."
0,Fresh,"At nearly 2 1/2 hours, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is as ridiculously overlong as its title, but it is also scary fun."
1,Rotten,"You realize you're watching a snuff film, where the victim isn't just teen innocence but teen romance."
1,Rotten,It is possible to support the journalistic ideal that no stoning should be left unturned while also championing better storytelling.
1,Rotten,"If you care about the material, you already saw it done earlier, and better, in the Gibney film."
0,Fresh,"""'Us' is going to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. By the film's very end, you're going to have one thought on your mind: I need to watch this again. Immediately."""
1,Rotten,"When endured at a 129 minutes, Song to Song totally lack the lyricism intended. In actuality, it has all the poetry of a greeting card"

0,Fresh,"The most misunderstood, underrated film of 2013."
0,Fresh,"With impeccable production design and special effects it's always a feast for the eyes and Newt Scamander is such a decent sort, charmingly played by Redmayne, you never stop caring."
1,Rotten,It ends up feeling as stale as week-old bagels and lox.
0,Fresh,"Lassie is old-fashioned family entertainment, and I hope audiences aren't afraid to take a chance on a movie that might not be paced like a race car, but offers gentle adventure and alternative heroism instead."

0,Fresh,Salazar's Revenge is a solid couple of hours escapism and - whilst there might be the law of diminishing returns to some after seeing this - don't bet on Sparrow and Co. sailing off into the sunset just yet.
1,Rotten,"O'Connor treats the brothers' stories like two separate movies, but both are cliched, and we don't learn enough about the rules of mixed martial arts to be drawn into the many, many bouts we see."

1,Rotten,The first truly terrible picture of 2011.
0,Fresh,"I'd certainly be happy with more Kingsman movies, because [Taron] Egerton is a winning leading man and [Matthew] Vaughn's action direction remains fantastic, but this movie feels like a victim of its unanticipated success."

1,Rotten,Those hoping for an unintended laugh riot will be disappointed to learn that Slender Man is mostly just a flabbergasting bore.
0,Fresh,"Despite all the great things about Ralph Breaks the Internet, the movie gets slightly derailed in the middle act, but it's easier to look past is because you'll likely be focusing on all the Disney easter eggs and nostalgia throughout."

0,Fresh,This is an excellent mystery with superb performances all-round.
0,Fresh,"As a lifelong devotee of Dylan's music, I found this far and away the best of the four movies he's made, in large measure because it's chock-full of his music and dramatically structured like one of his epic tirades."

0,Fresh,"Eisenberg has a quirky, sensitive cool that distinguishes him from the slew of teen or almost-teen movie ranks of the moment..."
1,Rotten,"With its mixture of righteous politics and family turmoil, this didactic, unashamedly manipulative film wants to be something like a cross between Army of Shadows, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 classic of the French Resistance, and The Godfather."

1,Rotten,The Mexican fails because the entire movie changes its tone from one moment to the next.
1,Rotten,"These auxiliary tales are starting to look less and less like true standalone efforts, picking up the bad habits of one too many convenient tie-ins from their MCU cousins."
1,Rotten,"The Mexican of the title is actually a gun, not a person, which seems as instructive as any other detail of what might be wrong with not only this film but with the whole Hollywood project."
0,Fresh,"Writer-director Tanya Hamilton's striking debut is the rare recent American-independent film that goes beyond the private dramas of its protagonists, imagining them as players in broader historical moments."
1,Rotten,It doesn't want to commit to being about what it's about... Mostly I think it's just a copout.
0,Fresh,Kursk brings attention to a tragedy that gained minimal coverage in a powerful burst of courage. A film with gripping scenes of camaraderie and vital attention to the truth grants the audience a moment to reflect.
0,Fresh,"It's pedestrian in most ways, but Williams - with a little help from friends in the lighting, camera, hair and make-up departments - lends it a touch of magic amid the nonsense."

1,Rotten,Snatched fails to tap into the full potential of either of these funny ladies by shoehorning them into this unbecoming genre flick. It's not worth paying the ransom for this one.

1,Rotten,Muppets like you've never seen them - and probably never wanted to see them.
0,Fresh,"Director David F. Sandberg doesn't really do anything flashy or new. But he certainly knows how to solidly ramp up the suspense, and once he turns on the jolt juice, it really starts to flow."

1,Rotten,Rees should have pulled the plug on the whole thing...Instead the film drowns on its own.

1,Rotten,"This production pudding is so artificial that it is hard to believe any of the characters, save for Gainsbourg's."
1,Rotten,"Remarkably good performances by the supporting cast give this beauty-and-the-beast romantic comedy some laughs and warmth, but finding chemistry between the leads proves out of its league."
1,Rotten,"It's strictly a generic thriller, perhaps the 105th blatant rip-off of 'Fatal Attraction', but not without its own guilty pleasures."
0,Fresh,"If you can overcome the graphic nature of its casual violence, it is a lot of fun."
0,Fresh,"A sweet, slow-burn, the music themed movie never raises its drama level above a six. But without a lot of noise, it allows us into the lives of a father and daughter, who need to break free from each other."

1,Rotten,[The movie tries] too slavishly to duplicate the original without taking it in any new directions.
1,Rotten,"This movie doesn't just want to win your heart. It wants to beat the mortal stuffing out of it until it begs for mercy. If people cry at the end, it'll probably be from the pain of all that pummeling."
0,Fresh,"Is the 48fps format a good thing? Not unless the title had been Days of Our Hobbits or As the Shire Turns. My advice, then, would be to see this fairly entertaining movie in 2-D or even regular 3-D and leave the 48fps nonsense by the wayside."

0,Fresh,PITCH BLACK deserves to be recommended as a solid piece of genre entertainment.
0,Fresh,"This isn't the perfect Bond. It's over-long at two and half hours, and there are intermittent longueurs before it finally gets all the afterburners firing for the concluding 45 minutes. But lots of it is great, too."
1,Rotten,Sitting through the last reel (spoiler alert!) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House.
1,Rotten,"Doesn't actually tell a story or develop any kind of rising suspense or tingling chills so much as it presents a series of jump-shocks and sudden, loud noises."
1,Rotten,"I can't imagine who the filmmakers envisioned as their target audience. Is it a date movie? I don't think so. It's really not for children, either, unless they happen to be members of the Addams Family. Why?"

0,Fresh,If there's a sequel...I'm there!
1,Rotten,"If there's any justice, dawning or otherwise, at the multiplex, audiences will reject Zack Snyder's lumbering, dead-on-arrival superhero mélange, a $250 million tombstone for a genre in dire need of a break."
0,Fresh,"More amusing than you might expect, but probably not by much."
1,Rotten,"Connecting the incidents in Hegland's book gives Into the Forest plenty of dramatic kick, but the film leaves the impression that the characters' full selves remain stubbornly on the page, as thoughts not translated into action."
0,Fresh,"Spielberg's filmmaking shows extraordinary elegance and sweep, a grand visual style that was once called conventional but is now all too rare."

0,Fresh,The Great Hack is a terrifying documentary about the new threat of information mining.
1,Rotten,"There's good stuff in the margins. But on the heels of such successful comic-book adaptations as X-Men and Spider-Man, Johnson's film makes Daredevil look like the second-rate hero he never really was."
1,Rotten,"Burke and Hare is timid and dithering and blandly bad, and the new Ealing Studios seems unworthy of its inheritance, and it's all just a damn shame."
1,Rotten,Not since King Kong and Godzilla first slugged it out atop Mount Fuji has there been a more laughable -- or more ludicrous -- man-in-a-monster-suit movie.
1,Rotten,"When you see how hopeless the lives of the American people have become in endless independent films that drive the movie audience away in mobs, you understand why the big, dumb action comics and Will Ferrell alleged comedies make all the money."
1,Rotten,This sequel to the convoluted Night Watch offers more of the same.
0,Fresh,"Celebrity narration (by Nicole Kidman) and deft filmmaking necessarily take a backseat here to the anger, grief, and incongruous good humor of the man himself."
0,Fresh,"Based on a real-life Nazi operation, the film is a tense drama with performances that elevate the movie to the front rank of films set in concentration camps."
0,Fresh,"Friends is well-crafted, intelligent, genuinely adult fare."
0,Fresh,"While not as perversely enjoyable as his sophomore masterpiece... ""Palindromes"" nonetheless serves up experimental, thought-provoking fare with a side of queasy comedy"
0,Fresh,"It never forgoes the human moments for the farce, and the speed of the storytelling ensures that it is believable enough to work."
0,Fresh,A moodily effective thriller that shows that there's life in the undead yet.
1,Rotten,"A harmless film that could have been perfect for its leads, but given so little to do, they're never as endearing as the film implies."
1,Rotten,"My Best Friend's Girl isn't just a misfire; it's a misfire compounded by a chain of miscalculations, and it's hard to figure out who this could appeal to (except, perhaps, Dane Cook's fan club)."
0,Fresh,"After a rash of immature, bad-boy cinematic superheroes … a hero for whom decency, humility and self-sacrifice come naturally is a breath of fresh air."
0,Fresh,Drew Barrymore's directorial debut is slight yet charming.
1,Rotten,"The dialog is very terrible. And the problem, therefore, is that the actors have to wrestle with very terrible dialog."
1,Rotten,"Anderson is too enamored with his terrific ensemble cast. Perhaps 2 hours 20 minutes were needed for the plot to make any kind of sense, but there still feels like a lot of dead weight, and he is unable to infuse it with the energy of his other films."
0,Fresh,"How seriously are we supposed to take Hot Tub Time Machine? Well let's see. It's a movie about a time machine. In a hot tub. Beyond that, Hot Tub Time Machine is actually surprisingly, if sporadically, funny."
1,Rotten,The Walt Disney Production family picture is as pedestrian as its title.
1,Rotten,"With words streaming out of their mouths instead of into bubbles, Ethan and his gang of past, present and future lovers sound laughingly unbelievable."
0,Fresh,Roman Polanski somehow brought his brand of paranoid horror to the Hollywood mainstream with rousing success.
1,Rotten,"Akin strives to varnish everything with a thin layer of denunciation, of realism, xenophobic fury and offended feelings. But, again, nothing works. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Moana literally means 'the ocean' and as the heroine conquers her namesake, she also conquers your heart. You won't regret setting sail and voyaging with her."
1,Rotten,"Hardly the high-priced spread, this condescending comedy about Middle America will score with some audiences and put off others."
0,Fresh,"slow and difficult, and to some extent, that's what Kieslowski wanted"
0,Fresh,"Though not without its weak points, when the film works, it really delivers."
1,Rotten,Second Act has some promising moments but the comedy starring Jennifer Lopez falls into cliche-filled traps that are otherwise disappointing.
0,Fresh,"I enjoyed this scrappy little movie, the second consecutive one to feature a female heroine."
1,Rotten,"The Serenity crew's chemistry isn't enough to take this spaceship into the stratosphere, and Whedon unleashes his most provocative ideas too late in the proceedings."
0,Fresh,Built from a perfect story-telling collaboration.
0,Fresh,"Successfully points out the issues with politics nowadays without choosing a side. Irresistible hilariously points out all the flaws, in a very flawed system. A must watch."
1,Rotten,"It's admirably ambitious, with some great ideas, but its central conceit just doesn't work"
1,Rotten,may God have mercy on Blake's soul
0,Fresh,"The blend of melancholy, whimsy and emotional honesty in the performances by its young stars make this film more tolerable and affecting than it deserves to be."
0,Fresh,Selma is an almost impassable minefield of opportunities to make a bad film. Director Ava DuVernay danced through like Fred Astair.
1,Rotten,Spy Kids 2 lacks the element of surprise that delighted its original audiences.
1,Rotten,Tremendously bad.
0,Fresh,"A nice first step into Whedon's attempt to site his big-budget fantastical ideas into a smaller, more personal film."

0,Fresh,"Forget the chimp nature vs. nurture angle, someone should study the humans."
0,Fresh,Relatively minor but still gripping film noir.
0,Fresh,"The ensemble is terrific. These are pros at work here, and they not only show up the new action-star punks but prove they're far from expendable."
0,Fresh,Provides a compassionate look at problems of old age that Hollywood rarely bothers to treat seriously.
0,Fresh,And Then We Danced is so much more than a coming of age love story - and is all the better for it.
0,Fresh,This year's Disney full-length animated installment is a good one.
0,Fresh,"an intense, disturbing and bleak drama of ecstasy and insanity, all set in a world where, if there is a God at all, it truly requires a leap of faith into the dark to grasp Him."
0,Fresh,Tears of the Black Tiger is like a fever dream dripping with overripe romantic melodrama. Imagine Douglas Sirk directing a spaghetti western.
0,Fresh,"Brian De Palma transcends the pulpy horror feel by emphasising the awakening-sexuality metaphor, and using some glorious trickery."
0,Fresh,"Despite a few too-cute moments, the movie is both smarter and more sympathetic than that glib shorthand."
0,Fresh,"Driver's performance as an uncertain man getting through the day-to-day prosaic, quietly buoyed by passion and artistic commitment, is exquisite."
0,Fresh,The movie is sublimely funny. And interesting.
0,Fresh,"Once it gets the dumb 'Talk to the paw!' jokes out of its system, it's actually a reasonably charming, mostly benign kids' movie that adults can watch without their heads exploding."
0,Fresh,A stupendous mash of soap opera dramatics and gloriously over the top action.
0,Fresh,"For all of the things that are familiar and give you an immediate understanding as to what story you're watching as it unfolds, there's plenty to drink in."

0,Fresh,"The eclectic and incredible cast assembled by Stone in this patriotic anti-patriot statement includes Tom Sizemore, Vivica A. Fox and James Le Gros..."
1,Rotten,"The epic, game-changing twist of an ending which brings the series effectively full circle, is so ridiculously, even laughably over-the-top and off-the-rails that it feels more akin to the quirky, self-aware tone set by the last film."
0,Fresh,"Nowhere near as good as the book, but not bad for the kids."
0,Fresh,A devilishly complicated thriller of superior class.
0,Fresh,A likely Oscar nominee this year almost solely on the basis of its wondrous visuals.

1,Rotten,"Two hours of gory murders, non-sequitur scenes and an underdeveloped romance."
1,Rotten,Daft. But not nearly daft enough.
1,Rotten,"A must-see for Blanchett die-hard fans, though the nonstop lecture will exclude others."
0,Fresh,"Viewed purely as its own thing, The Singing Detective is a wonder to look at, centered by a compelling Downey performance"
0,Fresh,"With a ""Ryan Murphy LITE"" approach, this is a solid Haunted Mansion movie largely thanks to Samara Weaving's excellent performance."
0,Fresh,"Relentlessly discursive and somber, also hauntingly elliptical and exquisitely crafted."
0,Fresh,"While many biographical documentaries reduce their subjects to museum pieces, American presents the erstwhile Goat Boy as a force of nature, as vital and essential as he ever was."
0,Fresh,"a worthy, highly enjoyable follow-up... it has the same lively pace, suspenseful situations and off-the-wall jokiness of its predecessor."
0,Fresh,"It's less than it should've been, and a little mild. But Ozon makes it glide with confidence, in or out of heels."
1,Rotten,"The acting is terrible (and not in a good way), the script is boring and if you've seen the trailer you've already seen all the effects shots."
0,Fresh,"A small container for a host of enthralling ideas about child development, the maternal bond, the nature of reality, the psychic cost of repression and the existential perils, as well as the ineffable joys, of freedom. How do they all fit?"
0,Fresh,"Whether you savor wine, value farming rituals, and/or search for character-driven films with fine performances, you will find Back to Burgundy a story which beckons discovery."
0,Fresh,"[T]he movie certainly means well, and its worthwhile message (teamwork is good, selfishness is bad) should penetrate the brains of kids old enough to stay in their seats and pay attention to it."
1,Rotten,"Tempest boasts a little Shakespeare, a little Fellini, a lof of Cassavetes, and almost nothing of the Mazursky touch we've come to expect from the director of Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice and An Unmarried Woman."
1,Rotten,"Arlen's salvation plays out with tender cloying predictability, though Lauren Graham, as the chiropractor who falls for him, has more spark than the movie deserves."
0,Fresh,"Pulp Fiction is great American entertainment, a stylish and foxy comedy of errors."
1,Rotten,"The zoot suits and fedoras look great, but without a script or hard-eyed private detective in sight, it's merely a production designer's exercise."
0,Fresh,"Although slightly simple and predictable in narrative, there's enough Rio flavour - be it carnival, football, heat or culture - to keep the momentum."
1,Rotten,"Never quite gels into a cohesive cinematic experience and is, far too often, simply boring."
0,Fresh,"Alvin Schwartz' popular series of children's horror books comes to life in ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,"" a fun, lively adaptation that pays due homage to the original and manages to keenly balance laughs and scares."
0,Fresh,Snyder has done a good job of staying true to the source material.
1,Rotten,"They don't match the eye-popping athleticism of The Raid 2. In fact, some of it seems kind of stodgy."
0,Fresh,"The filmmakers manage to capture a world of lived-in homes (not quite urban, and not quite suburban), tired old cars, and tired people."
0,Fresh,Here's an issue that transcends politics and speaks to basic human need and collective responsibility; perhaps we need Moore's cudgel to make the case bluntly.
0,Fresh,"You feel anything could happen, even if you know exactly what's going to happen."
1,Rotten,An action flick for the video-arcade generation that cares little about character development or relationships.
1,Rotten,"When there's no more room in hell, the dead and dumb take over Hollywood and make movies like this"
0,Fresh,"In an era of constant political turmoil in both the United States and Turkey, the heartwarming humanity on display within Kedi is a welcome sight."
0,Fresh,A love story that never is never corny or predictable. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,I wanted to love it because it's so damn literary and exquisitely put together but ultimately it felt like a very long two hours.
0,Fresh,"...if the shade of the late Don Adams will forgive me for saying it, the original Get Smart should have been this good."
0,Fresh,"A bawdy, shock comedy laced with coarse dialogue, full-frontal nudity, sophomoric slapstick and bodily-function fare. The tried and true Farrelly Brothers formula, if that's your taste!"
1,Rotten,A rather offensive misfire of style.
0,Fresh,"[A] tongue-in-cheek, knife-in-guts action thriller..."
1,Rotten,"Chockablock with instances of characters not shooting, running, attacking, or sneaking away when they can or should, this thriller comes off like the world's most rigged game."
1,Rotten,"Though often well acted and at times impressively directed, the new film eliminates Craven's ugly-to-the-core visual style, tones down the violence and softens the bleakness of the original premise, yet in doing so it becomes more problematic."
0,Fresh,Starred Up may cover familiar ground but it's executed with such arresting authenticity that it's hard to not be drawn in and ultimately excited. This is prison melodrama done amazingly well with sharp performances and visceral attention to detail.
0,Fresh,"Director McQueen's now signature techniques are on full display here. In Ejiofor, McQueen finds another gifted actor that embraces hard and emotive story-telling."
1,Rotten,"Surprisingly mean-spirited, unfunny and features possibly the most annoying ensemble of child actors in recent memory."
1,Rotten,This isn't as much entertainment as an attempt to beat the moviegoer into submission with repetitive action scenes and two-dimensional characters.
0,Fresh,"By keeping the spectacular possibilities open, through the opening scenes of the destruction of Krypton, and the subsequent growth to manhood of the planet's only son on the plains of the Midwest, the film allows naivet and knowingness to coexist."
1,Rotten,Has there ever been a film in which the hero has so much sex without properly taking off his trousers?
0,Fresh,"21 doesn't quite hit the jackpot, but with popcorn it should satisfy."
0,Fresh,Connery's best Bond. Never again would he be this assured. This is closer to a classic spy thriller than any other Bond.
0,Fresh,"Shopgirl, written by Steve Martin, based on his slender novel of the same name, is an elegant and exquisitely tailored romantic comedy."
0,Fresh,"A talk-heavy script about racial prejudice and other ills through the eyes of a mute black alien, terrifically played by John Sayles' regular Joe Morton."
0,Fresh,"By keeping the tone from becoming too somber and generating a degree of sympathy for Jewell, Eastwood has crafted an engaging (albeit fictionalized) account of the triumph of ordinary men over the establishment."
0,Fresh,"Sallitt has a good line in barbed wit, whether capturing the intricacies and absurdities of losing your virginity in someone's car or caustically examining Jackie's thoughts on the world."
0,Fresh,It has a perfect balance of comedy and ridiculousness mixed with heart and compassion and growth.
1,Rotten,It's unclear why a remake of 1987's Can't Buy Me Love was necessary.
1,Rotten,This is an average movie that's chock-full of New-Age-y self help. And not much else.
1,Rotten,Most of the characters are so annoying that you want them to die ... a recipe' for a railroad-spike lobotomy migraine
0,Fresh,"Swift, hilarious and impossible to resist."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, what in theory could've been the superhero epic to end all superhero epics ends up having all the impact of an average episode of a live-action Justice League TV show."
0,Fresh,Its extended running time and the sheer brutality of its subject matter will likely make this film a tough sell for non-hardcore history buffs.
1,Rotten,One tiresome slog through one familiar swamp.
0,Fresh,"Much like its heroine, Unicorn Store is not without its flaws, but also like Kit herself, deserves to be celebrated and appreciated on the basis of its strengths."
0,Fresh,"Cruise, sporting a Southern accent, is magnetic, a presence with gravity, one that drives the energy of each scene."
1,Rotten,"Lands with a thud right from its painfully unfunny prologue and maintains its plodding, exasperating course straight through to its car-chase-and-shootout finale."
0,Fresh,"Certainly not easy to digest, but the internal struggle director/co-writer Ziad Doueiri isolates here is exceptional at times, giving the divisive topic the meditative approach it deserves."
0,Fresh,A black-cast romantic comedy that derives its humor from character and plot development rather than from cliched notions of race-based uproariousness...
0,Fresh,The story of a gruelling trek through sub-zero temperatures that is both visually stunning and dramatically chilly.
0,Fresh,"Power Rangers is earnest and it has a good heart. There should be more movies like it, only better-made."
0,Fresh,"Brad Bird made his name with two brilliant animated films, The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Mission Impossible 4 is his first live-action film, and it confirms that he is a first-rate director."
0,Fresh,A worthy exploration of characters circling an issue of passionate import to plenty of people in the Northwest.
0,Fresh,"Chadha does a decent job directing, while Parminder Nagra does a good job acting. The movie's main problem is that it's a little more fussy than it needs to be."
0,Fresh,"An exquisite, humanistic and subtly topical work of cinema art that manages to keep the intimate, revelatory sensibility of a one-man play intact while fleshing out the characters and creating a very realistic and richly detailed school community."
0,Fresh,"While it's almost certainly guaranteed to be a box office bomb, I'm suspecting this goofy little adventure will earn a few bemused fans once it hits DVD."
0,Fresh,"If you're prepared to sit back and enjoy the limo ride, Entourage is enjoyable on its own terms as entertaining, breezy escapism."
0,Fresh,"Subtle it is not, (there are suicide attempts and straitjackets and glassings and excruciating karaoke) but subtlety can suck it when the result is this vibrant and vital."
0,Fresh,"Hall, Shepard and Johnson ... comprise a compelling trio in a fable that explores masculinity and the responsibility of fathers for their sons."
1,Rotten,... technically solid but dramatically unremarkable ...
0,Fresh,one of the last and most successful products of a less-cynical cinematic age
1,Rotten,Saw V is a terrible combination: grisly and tedious. Let's just call it bloody dull.
1,Rotten,"Genius is a work of admiration and curiosity, but it is simply not a work of genius, so that's regrettable."
0,Fresh,"The casting is a real coup, with Barr going her everywoman TV persona one better by breaking the big screen heroine mold, and Streep blowing away any notion that she can't be funny."
1,Rotten,"For those who do not consider themselves to be among the Sex and the City faithful, this is a painful experience, perhaps the longest 148 minutes likely to be spent in a movie theater this year. Watching grass grow is more dramatically satisfying."
1,Rotten,The final showdown between sole survivor and killer is sufficiently well-done that you wonder why the rest of the film didn't measure up.
0,Fresh,"This is no nostalgia trip taken by an 83-year-old director. It's a fierce, hot slap of a movie, a shameless melodrama with bite."
0,Fresh,All in all I think of it as The Hobbit: A Better Than Expected Journey.
0,Fresh,"Yes, I loved this film. But these are partisan times. My fervent hope is that you will go and see it before you pick a side. And perhaps that when you vote this year you might spare a thought for the future of this planet we all share."
1,Rotten,"The concept is the same, and just as tired as it was when the second, third and fourth sequels to Paranormal Activity's 2009 first installment."
0,Fresh,"This absorbing, highly personal documentary gives a stripped-down, inside look at a glamorous business, which can often be anything but."
1,Rotten,"You know what would be brave? Making an unflinching film about a difficult-to-tackle topic and complex characters, and sticking to your message, damn the torpedoes."
0,Fresh,...an impressive debut for a promising new director.
0,Fresh,"[CANNES 2016] ""Hell or High Water"" is a real gem - a high point Cannes 2016. Look for this entertaining drama to attract a following in the States and beyond."
1,Rotten,"The familiar beats of the tale are comforting, rather than galvanizing, because we know what's coming."
0,Fresh,"...an immaculately crafted, visually stunning and affecting rite-of-passage drama"
0,Fresh,"Edwards appears to have elevated what could have been simply a cash-in into something that feels essential, even magical. It has the distinct smell of victory."
1,Rotten,"...wait until it hits the ""dollar theater""..."
0,Fresh,An entire movie of Pfeiffer and Jolie throwing special effects and shade at each other would have made this the most fun fantasy flick of the year.
0,Fresh,"Its pace is a little slack, and sometimes it feels too predictably prepackaged. But Jones and Hammer keep the picture moving even through its shakier phases."
1,Rotten,"It looks great, but a weak script, lacklustre acting and silly relationships drag it down."
0,Fresh,"IT is horror with heart and high jinks. If taking on a killer clown and all IT's compadres leads to the adventure the Losers have, you'll float, too."
0,Fresh,"Certain Women is a kind, loving, and deeply moving portrait of big-hearted small-town people."
0,Fresh,I love this movie most of all because of its career-defining performance by Slate. Her work here reminds me of Tom Hanks from '80s comedies.
1,Rotten,"One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie, but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations."
1,Rotten,"Like Wilson, Mann can wring laughs even from mediocre lines. Here's an idea: How about Apatow and Rogen forget the freaky-geeky boys for a while and give Mann a starring role?"
0,Fresh,"Lancaster gets better with age; he is capital as the magnate with equal passions for astronomy and moneymaking. Peter Riegert is effective as his ambassador, and the Scottish actors are refreshing and adept."
0,Fresh,A a tour de force that's bound to give the French writer/director (Mia Hansen-Lve) the U.S. recognition she's long deserved.
0,Fresh,"Ultimately it is redeemed by its palpably clammy sense of foreboding, + its offering of a valuable history lesson."
1,Rotten,"A film about peering beneath the surface, I Feel Pretty ultimately ignores its own advice."
0,Fresh,An intricate and beautiful film about friendship and its implications
0,Fresh,"One suspects that writers in Tales from the Script might have more to say about the art and the joy of creating, but Hanson seems less interested in their craft, spending much of the film allowing the writers to vent about the industry."
0,Fresh,"For all their garishness, the Siegels are pretty likable, even if attempts to make you sympathetic to their ""plight"" fall short."
1,Rotten,Both men think that the best way to deliver the right to remain silent to the usual suspects is via a right hook.
0,Fresh,"Fans of Melissa McCarthy can rejoice: With ""Spy,"" the very charming, deeply lovable, potently funny actress finally gets a role worthy of her talent."
1,Rotten,"Whatever young Carlos and Nicole share doesn't feel like something worth taking a risk for. For a date movie, uh, that's a problem."
0,Fresh,It is theology-challenging to encounter a story where the rousing rescue doesn't come. Or at least not in the way we expect.
0,Fresh,"Writer-director Mitchell Lichtenstein's pop culturally aware blend of horror, comedy, teen exploitation and '50s monster movies comes off like an unholy alliance between John Waters and Todd Haynes."
0,Fresh,"An ode to the loss of religious values, with a message full of solemn pessimism inspired by Hegel's painful idea of God's death, and the fear for a world without order or justice of Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"A B picture in love with the zest of its comic-book origins, it embodies that medium's pulse-pounding spiritedness and silliness."
0,Fresh,"Sit down to watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and enter into Ang Lee's enchanted cinema."
0,Fresh,"""Warped, violent, dark, funny, sexy. Great stuff."""
0,Fresh,"A Dog's Journey is hackneyed, saccharin, weepy, cliched, predictable and formulaic. And it's a must-see for any dog lover."
0,Fresh,"What this well-intentioned film lacks in poise and polish, it makes up for in what faith-based audiences so hungrily seek: a passionate and compassionate interpretation for family viewing that portrays the Christ story with reverence."
0,Fresh,"My only reservation about Caine is his less than credible Texas accent, especially since his brother's is so pronounced."
0,Fresh,"It isn't the kind of film you'd want to introduce to your parents, but it's a perfectly acceptable fling - the sort of movie that bumps into you on a busy street, offers a sheepish apology, asks you out for coffee and promptly disappears from your life."
0,Fresh,"Detail after detail, Yedaya charts the emotional push-pull between daughter and mother and their internal turmoils."
0,Fresh,"At times Short Term 12 seems uncertain where it's going, but this matches the circumstances of both staff and residents."
1,Rotten,The thin story never generates any genuine excitement.
1,Rotten,"Everything, Everything has the style to draw in fans of the Young Adult genre, but it lacks the substance to truly resonate when compared to other (better) YA films."
0,Fresh,"The music itself is easily digestible pop...His self-assurance is a little disconcerting - but, as the home videos show, he always had that kind of natural confidence."
0,Fresh,"Every delicious situation is finger-licking good as the shy, clumsy Linguini becomes Remy's puppet, the rat-puppeteer holding onto large tufts of the novice-chef's hair and tugging them decisively, manipulating his every move."
0,Fresh,"Generic, but badass."
1,Rotten,"The idea is that given the basic premise, the comedian will fill in the gaps with his own bits of business. Cedric is hardly up to the task. Though he's a scene stealer in other people's movies, he relies on tired reactions (""heeellll naw"" is his mantra)."
0,Fresh,"It's partly a scientific brief, partly a song of sex, and it's enormously enjoyable."
1,Rotten,"Cassavetes here applies his remarkable talent for social observation in a light-comedy context and creates one of the strangest, and in many ways most frustrating, screen comedies in recent years."
0,Fresh,"...definitely a film that is tailor-made for watching at home, on a Friday night when your critical faculties have slightly failed you..."

1,Rotten,"Suffocating, nerve-fraying and deeply uncomfortable to watch. Just not in the ways intended."
1,Rotten,"These Chicks should be, like, totally stood up"
0,Fresh,"Succeeds both as entertainment, musicology and American Indian history. It shows that no matter how hard white America tried to force Indians to be ""white"", they maintained their traditions even expressing them as rock-and-roll."
0,Fresh,"""Deathgasm"" is perhaps too busy for its own good and not always seamlessly plotted but the movie's infectious sensibilities are hard to deny."
1,Rotten,This grim holiday-themed comedy is the movie equivalent of getting socks and underwear for Christmas.
0,Fresh,"It's quite a movie -- atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic."
1,Rotten,"Two of the screenwriters, Steve Zacharias and Jeff Buhai, also wrote Revenge of the Nerds, so it's not surprising that they're more interested in tame teen-age fantasies than in social satire."
1,Rotten,"Marnie may be a quiet end to the pantheon of animated masterpieces that have streamed out of Hayao Miyazaki's studio, but the film is satisfying in its own way."
1,Rotten,"Burns rebuilds the vibe a bit toward the end, but by that time the clumsy drama has overshadowed the mellow atmosphere. It's a total bummer."
1,Rotten,The script BvS is guaranteed to make people stop complaining about the sloppiness of the third act of Spectre.
1,Rotten,"t's worth noting at this point that in real life, a good number of people, most of them doctors, have gone to jail for fraudulently inseminating women."

0,Fresh,Oliver Stone (Best Director Oscar) directs this film about individuals whose traditional patriotism is ambushed by the Vietnam War and reborn in political protest.
1,Rotten,"Writer-director Jeff Baena maintains a tongue-in-cheek attitude throughout that it so ironic it undermines audience engagement. He might have been able to carry it off had the movie been in any way funny, but it isn't."
1,Rotten,"Roland Emmerich's global warming disaster flick is big, dumb and flat, but hard to really hate."
1,Rotten,Korine is just too old for this s**t

1,Rotten,"The film insufficiently connects the book's prophecy with its present-day, real-world forms of realization."
0,Fresh,"It is, in fact, more charming than expected, this peculiar hour with this peculiar man, and amounts to a good distracting journey into the world of drummers, which, in fairness, is much-maligned."
1,Rotten,"The sheer wastefulness of Eran Creevy's Welcome to the Punch is off-putting enough, but the film is also falsely painted-up as a crime epic."
1,Rotten,Makes you hope that Santa brings you coal in your stocking - so that you can use it to go upside the head of anyone remotely involved with its production.
0,Fresh,Arrietty is a magical piece of old-fashioned storytelling with a lovely musical score by Cécile Corbel.
0,Fresh,"Who knew? The director who put the rage in Raging Bull the fear in Cape Fear and the mean in Mean Streets could make a family-friendly, dazzling 3D film."
0,Fresh,"The pace is far less frenetic than other recent actioners, and the tone more thoughtful. With a lovely score and particularly nice performances from its central trio, the final cut of Oblivion suggests greatness was not entirely out of reach."
1,Rotten,"If you listen closely enough, you can hear the ""Laugh Now"" box lighting up."
0,Fresh,"Coogan's comic timing has never been better, and Meaney is perfectly cast as his friend/foil. The film hums along at a brisk pace, piling one witty absurdity on top of another."
0,Fresh,It is remarkable for admirable direction and brilliant acting. Howard Hawks has done his work with skill and knowledge.

1,Rotten,"Not just childish, smug and unfunny but a hideous affront to the 9/11 families, to whom Spurlock owes an abject apology."
0,Fresh,"Like a palooka charging from his corner, Creed plunges ahead with only a few sidesteps. (Director) Coogler takes his time with each development, endearing these already likable characters to the viewer even more."
0,Fresh,"It uses powerful, naturalistic performances from a juvenile cast to emphasize the spirited fortitude of kids stuck in terrible situations, but never resorts to even an atom of sentimentality."

1,Rotten,Alien Trespass won't let our knowledge of the stereotypes it incorporates do the work and make the critique.
1,Rotten,"A remake of the 1968 Lucille Ball-Henry Fonda vehicle, Raja Gosnell's version is less a movie than a series of kids-in-an-uproar scenes."
1,Rotten,"A Girl and a Gun seems designed to encourage the growing number of American ladies packing heat, but it's practically reverse propaganda..."
0,Fresh,"This is a gentler [Spike] Lee here, leading us through an involved thriller carried by a top notch cast."
0,Fresh,"Hong is still unwilling to serve up a straight memoir or let himself play out a fantasy in which a woman acts as his perfect love object. To put it mildly, a director like Woody Allen could learn a lot from him."
0,Fresh,"Relentless and thoroughly preposterous, Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy's script hews to its own batty logic, its frantic pacing peppered with morbid humor."
0,Fresh,"Alice Wu's sophomore film is one of the smartest, warmest, and most affecting YA films in years."
1,Rotten,"Ignore the unconvincing performances and tinge of environmental proselytizing and focus on the computer-generated wind ripping apart a computer-generated barn, and Into the Storm still lacks the force it would take to blow out a candle on a birthday cake."
1,Rotten,"It's a limited viewpoint of a much larger, high-stakes issue."
1,Rotten,An unconvincingly broad culture-clash comedy whose Latino and African-American ensemble might've made for a progressive film if director and co-writer Rick Famuyiwa hadn't pandered to the lowest common denominator.
0,Fresh,"It has winningly Potteresque teen-dragon-slayer classes, a queen-bee dragon as grand as Godzilla, and a layer of age-of-terror allegory about the ignorance bred by jingoism."
0,Fresh,"Doles out just enough information and just enough plot twists at just the right pace, giving you just what you came for."
0,Fresh,"It sends the mind moving, to the links between Vietnam and Iraq, to the bonds of grief and friendship, and to what it means to serve a country and an institution that gives and takes away."
1,Rotten,"It's good-spirited, and there are enough colorful characters to please its intended audience. Best of all is an Earth-built robot on wheels named Rover, who thinks it's a dog. He'll be a hit. If only the main characters were as interesting."

0,Fresh,"Set in the year 2020 but scavenges its buffed and retooled spare parts not just from the Mattel aisle at Toys R Us but from a vast and ancient junkyard, overflowing with all the shameless crowd-pleasing hokum and staged public violence of eras past."
1,Rotten,"Dugan has a brisk, imaginative comic style; he sets up his gags well, so that there's still some surprise in the punch lines when they come."
0,Fresh,"It has the sensibility of [Andrei] Tarkovsky, but it also has the rage and thriller aspects of Ridley Scott."
1,Rotten,"That this particular retelling of the Jane Austen novel feels like a Cliffs Notes version is understandable; that its zombie bits are equally rudimentary, though, is more disappointing."
1,Rotten,Let the vomit-and-gas jokes begin!
0,Fresh,"Smutty, salacious female relationship comedy, appealing to the libidinous 'Sex and the City' and 'Bridesmaids' crowd."
1,Rotten,It isn't just that there's something unsettling about a film that aestheticizes a crematorium; it's that there's something trivializing about the very effort.
1,Rotten,"After a long, storied career of engaging, thought-provoking films, Ridley Scott has succumbed to the gutless predictability that Pauline Kael initially envisioned, and Alien: Covenant is precisely the carnival fare she saw in the 1979 original."

1,Rotten,"[An] obnoxious, headache-inducing horror show."
0,Fresh,This repitilian horror thriller is the stuff of which nightmares are made.
0,Fresh,"Ghost Ship is produced with a certain level of restraint by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, with a script credited to Mark Hanlon and John Pogue that draws upon many familiar sources and suffers only mildly from Narrative Deficit Disorder."
1,Rotten,"This holiday movie would have to improve 1,000 fold to reach the level of merely being awful."
0,Fresh,"Although flawed and far-flung from the original film, Cheaper is still a sweetly saccharine alternative to some of the ""heavier"" films out there this holiday season, that does have some very funny family moments."

1,Rotten,"Aside from the sheer insanity of trying to leap into the shoes of the irreplaceable Phil Silvers, surely Martin should have recognized that the film had no script, no gags and no discernible point."
1,Rotten,"Lopez could have chosen a better comeback project than The Back-up Plan. Despite her best efforts, this romantic comedy is pretty dreadful, with a silly sitcom-like plot that even Lopez can't overcome."
1,Rotten,A yawn of a movie from Woody Allen
1,Rotten,"Put Tom Green in enough movies, and eventually something funny will happen. Stealing Harvard offers more evidence that this hasn't happened yet."

1,Rotten,"""Diana"" isn't just an egregious case of rewriting history, but one of oversimplifying it."

1,Rotten,Sprinkles only a few highlights of real musical talent through an otherwise blatant pat-on-the-back montage.
1,Rotten,"The movie is too sophisticated in its first hour for preteens, and much too tragically unhip in its second hour for the older teenage audience that might appreciate its pithier wisecracks."
0,Fresh,"Spy offers plenty of laughs along the way, thanks to McCarthy, but it's disappointingly slapdash and déjà vu."
0,Fresh,"Christopher Plummer's humbugged-to-the-max take on the immortal miser easily ranks as the most nuanced and memorable interpretation since Alastair Sim set the gold standard for wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinners."
0,Fresh,"I had a great time. It was like skipping school, stealing some comic books, and reading them behind an old abandoned warehouse."
0,Fresh,"What I missed in the trailer-and, honestly, one could almost miss in the film itself-is the detail that elevates it to an entirely different level of fascination: The Mole Agent is a documentary."
0,Fresh,"The ironies of the schematic storyline become somewhat pat, but the movie asks tough, vexing questions about the responsibilities of parenthood and citizenship."
0,Fresh,The Divide is extremely nasty and relentlessly bleak but it's worth seeing if you like that sort of thing.
1,Rotten,Here is a movie so concerned with in-jokes and updates for Trekkers that it can barely tear itself away long enough to tell a story.
0,Fresh,"It's entertaining, but it's also a bit goofy -- Holmes here is a Victorian 007."
0,Fresh,[Hangar 10] breaks no new ground but delivers some creepy moments.
1,Rotten,"The story (written by Anderson and Noah Baumbach) meanders in such a meaningless way that the visual details, as carefully wrought as they are, come off as mere props."

1,Rotten,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves has pomp and scale; what it lacks is something essential -- a sense of ""Once Upon a Time"" wonder, the exultant, heady thrill of legend."
1,Rotten,A lot of what Miller can get away with on the page -- the cliched tough guy banter and Existentialism 101 -- falls flat when played live.
1,Rotten,"Aimless, lifeless comedy from Hanks' phone-it-in period."

0,Fresh,"Ripe with sordid beauty even in its tumults of violence... firmly demarcated by the 1970s, the time [of Ballard's novel], not our world, and yet wholly ours, a place of privilege and brutality where idle hands form fists or readily take up weaponry."

0,Fresh,"Knives and Skin delivers beguiling, intense vignettes of movie magic."
0,Fresh,"Gelb creates a peaceful, contemplative mood with his long shots of men delicately molding fish onto rice, such that when Ono walks past a blaring shopping-mall video-screen at one point, the intrusion of the modern world seems out of place."
0,Fresh,"2 Days is a sparky, crowd-cheering gem buoyed by Julie Delpy's smart writing and Adam Goldberg's tart whining. Less swoony than Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset, but Delpy nails the relationship humour."

0,Fresh,"A powerful and surprisingly moving film about an important and little-reflected-upon topic; a telling snapshot of political maneuvering, and the tossed-around wrecking-ball weight of corporate might as it relates to individual rights."
1,Rotten,"Fleshing out Maleficent's origins felt necessary, the attention given to this did feel like a departure from the rest of the story, only coming together in the final act, leaving the audience to wonder why we should care, or even why Maleficent would."
1,Rotten,Tears of the Sun reduces the concept of pillaging a village to something like an R-rated ride at Disney World -- sort of like the Pirates of the Caribbean with atrocities.
1,Rotten,David Bowers's film looks good and tries for a bit of adult interest by suggesting there might be another way other than arrant capitalism. It's not much less sophisticated than Avatar but hasn't the eye-catching novelty.
0,Fresh,"Surprisingly sweet and, dare we say it, old-fashioned."

1,Rotten,"It's difficult to believe in Arthur, to root for his well-being after enduring 100 minutes of tepidly scripted buffoonery and shrill improvisation. Arthur doesn't need love, he needs a ball gag."
1,Rotten,"A big, dumb movie, another Hollywood entertainment that, instead of tweaking and teasing our brains for fun, leaves us feeling thick and stupid."
1,Rotten,"Loses sight of its most compelling story and gets weighed down by an anti-war theme, no matter how much you agree or disagree with that theme, and no matter how well the cast performs."

0,Fresh,"We always think of the separation of church and state as being there to protect the state, but the film makes a powerful case that it's there to prevent politics from cheapening and commodifying faith, as well."
1,Rotten,"Picture spins about, hitting a few sublimely quivering beats of frustration and confession before it loses itself to pretension and trivial displays of surrealism. There's a remarkable film in here somewhere."
0,Fresh,"What distinguishes writer-director Scott Cooper's debut is his storytelling, affecting but never maudlin, and a fearless performance by Bridges."

0,Fresh,Think of Shorts as The Hangover for 10-year-olds -- or for anybody who truly appreciates booger humor.
0,Fresh,"Part of the reason this film works so splendidly is that, given its ending, it doesn't have the luxury of pretend redemption."

1,Rotten,"By focusing less on his characters and more on a supposed dark side of Russian hockey, Polsky's film is less documentary than it is didacticism."
0,Fresh,"Even when Birbiglia's storylines takepredictable turns, he finds the most discomforting way to make those turns. And yet none of the anxiety or awkwardness feels forced."

0,Fresh,The Meddler feels toned down a few notches from your typical movie comedy. It feels like life.
0,Fresh,"Without a trace of luridness, We the Animals manages to be heartbreaking and harrowing. What saves it from being depressing is the exhilaration of Zagar's direction, and the unbridled energy and unstudied authenticity of the cast."

1,Rotten,"Alice's adventures lose something in their contemporary translation, and there is very little to care about. It's nicely shot, though, in the style of a 1980s music video."
0,Fresh,"It's familiar stuff, but at least it takes addiction and recovery seriously; the depiction of Alcoholics Anonymous feels particularly heartfelt."
0,Fresh,"in The Squid and the Whale, Noah Baumbach weds his verbal gifts to a fresh visual acuity that brings layers of rich detail to a portrait of a family coping, poorly, with self-inflicted change."

0,Fresh,"A period piece adaptation of a memoir that has a lot going for it, including nice production design, cinematography and performances. But it would do better with a bit less hearty of an attempted embrace of the whole truth, one surmises."
0,Fresh,"It's rambling and spaced-out, with an absurdly severe conclusion that mucks with the strange tonality of the work, yet writer/director/co-star Sebastian Silva finds a breezy rhythm that's worth a look."
1,Rotten,"Beneath the well-tuned atmospherics lurks a schlocky, ludicrous and distasteful yarn"
0,Fresh,"While Ceremony may not look or feel terribly original, Winkler has clearly learned a lot from his study of [Wes] Anderson's oeuvre, and he's made a comedy that's intelligent, stylish, and effective even when it's emulating someone else's work."
0,Fresh,"Toy Story is now a quartet of great movies, with a fantastic new installment to make audiences laugh, gasp and, yes, cry - again."
0,Fresh,Both one of the most influential films ever made and one of the most rarely shown.
0,Fresh,"Months from now, or maybe years, we'll probably look at Zak Hilditch's ""1922"" as the most essential Stephen King adaptation produced in 2017."
0,Fresh,"Wheelman is paced like a juiced up F1 car, racing through its roughly hour-and-fifteen-minute run time with barely any pit stops."
1,Rotten,"To add your own entertainment value, one game you can play during the film is to guess how many minutes will have gone by before Willis ends up with a single mark on his white top."
0,Fresh,"Little here is truly remarkable, but it's the variety that keeps it bounding long."
0,Fresh,"Besides exhilarating, terrifying action, what 28 Weeks Later achieves best is a mood of terror, vigilant fear, and high-alert tummy flutters. Worth every penny."
0,Fresh,"What Edwards and screenwriter Max Borenstein get is that while Godzilla is a monster, he is a monster we want to cheer."
0,Fresh,"I sing the rage of Frances McDormand... When she is good, she is very, very good, but when she is mad she is better."
0,Fresh,"It has all the sappy, schmaltz you'd expect from Richard Curtis. It lays hard into good feelings and hopeful endings."
0,Fresh,"Smart, empathetic, fun loving and, best of all, a delight for all audiences."
0,Fresh,"... Fanaa falls into the realm of disposable melodrama, yet is rendered strangely entertaining thanks to Aamir and Kajol."
1,Rotten,"""To the Wonder"" is a trailer for itself, although it could be mistaken for a high-end perfume commercial ..."
0,Fresh,"It offers no judgment, nor does it proffer a solution, but this slow-paced and vivid glimpse behind the veil is an achievement and an education."
1,Rotten,A shallow and half-hearted film. [full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,The film is more perky than actually funny.
0,Fresh,"It's [Silverman's] hysterically wrongheaded standup persona, showcased in the one-woman show Jesus Is Magic, that's been twisting politically correct writers into descriptive knots."
1,Rotten,"The betrayals, reconciliations and revelations are forced on us with clockwork precision, and no cliche goes unexplored."
1,Rotten,"...a well-acted film that doesn't go particularly anywhere, a film with strong production values whose director appears to lack confidence of vision. It's both overworked and underdone."
0,Fresh,Rod Lurie's film equals the original and surpasses it in many ways.
0,Fresh,"Gary Oldman gives an impeccable performance as Winston Churchill in a gorgeously photographed, suspenseful World War II film that suffers from too much hero worship."
1,Rotten,"Scott Cooper's film moves at a funereal pace, implicitly celebrating its sluggishness as a mark of integrity."
0,Fresh,It's a pleasure to finally join the chorus of praise and see Hittman hit her stride; this is the movie I've been waiting for from her.
0,Fresh,"Fully visceral, visually impressive."
0,Fresh,"Gomez-Rejon and scriptwriter Michael Mitnick rely on effective storytelling, interesting characterizations and period opulence to give the movie its charge."
0,Fresh,"Though mostly twaddle as history, Yorgos Lanthimos's The Favourite is wonderful, nasty fun, a period drama (wigs, breeches, beauty spots) that holds the screen with gnashing teeth and slashing nails."
0,Fresh,An excellent cast and the film's authentic period look help transport us back to 1880s New Mexico while watching a very angry woman out for revenge.
1,Rotten,"The fires themselves are frighteningly well staged, and by the film's conclusion the courage and dedication of these firemen has been amply demonstrated. It's a pity that the film that tells their story wasn't a little less clunky."
1,Rotten,The real problem is that September Dawn isn't a very good movie. It moves too much like a public-school history pageant and gives us mono-dimensional characters who speak dialogue that fairly reeks of printer's ink.
0,Fresh,"While it holds two superb performances from its leads and is a beautifully rendered portrait of the human spirit, it's not without its faults."
0,Fresh,An irresistible gem of sweetness and concision.
1,Rotten,"A narrative divide that never quite comes together, despite some truly uplifting moments. And seems unable to decide whether it wants to be a sports movie or a political biopic. Invictus: Or rather, 'I am the rugby captain of Mandela's soul.'"
1,Rotten,"Silent Hill Revelation 3D is an inferior sequel in every way, shape and form, a horror sequel that fails to either intrigue or scare, and one that just might have killed the franchise cold-dead."
0,Fresh,"A quietly affecting, acutely observed little gem of a drama."
0,Fresh,"The proceedings move so quietly and thoughtfully as to be occasionally somnolent, though they're punctuated with spasms of the violence that marked the Troubles."
1,Rotten,Something's missing from the center of this self-consciously hip film noir: a hero you can feel for.
0,Fresh,One of the things the Coens may or may not be ridiculing in this award-season release is Hollywood's earnest faith in itself.
0,Fresh,"Black Mass is all about Bulger. But thankfully, that means it's all about Depp. And you won't be able to tear your eyes from him - even when you want to."
0,Fresh,"Has the right mindset, but not always the right material."
1,Rotten,Confusing thriller is absolutely NOT for kids.
1,Rotten,"A combination of state-of-the-art cinematography and old-fashioned documentary storytelling, this gorgeous film is 3D visually, but frustratingly two-dimensional otherwise."
1,Rotten,Somebody needs to write them up a ticket - for impersonating a great movie.
0,Fresh,"For most of its length, this is a grippingly unpleasant picture of barbaric, gratuitous evil, stealthier and scarier than Funny Games, to which it bears a slight resemblance."
1,Rotten,"Tropic Thunder is nothing but mild vulgarity mixed with explosions and entitlement, a piss take on Hollywood excess that doubles as an example of it."
1,Rotten,A woeful little comedy that runs out of steam shortly after its opening sequence.
1,Rotten,"A nihilistic, narcissistic, knuckleheaded move about nihilistic, narcissistic knuckleheads, The Informers might have been an interesting exercise in satire, if it only had a sense of humor. Which it doesn't."
0,Fresh,"Beatty's fine, but this is no Hail, Caesar!"
0,Fresh,Harrelson rewards watching; he's no less potent at rest than when he explodes in calculated rage.
1,Rotten,"As ever, without a funny script, Carell looks and sounds like the world's creepiest serial killer."
1,Rotten,"As feminist fantasy, the film is non-committal, and as a reimagining of the fairy tale, it's at best expensive-looking without seeming wantonly so."
0,Fresh,The Coen Brothers have done it again - made an ensemble crime caper comedy that's pure tinsel town gold!
0,Fresh,Some have condemned this film for 'filthy content.' That's like condemning a hospital for being a place of disease. Kidd deals with 'filth' the way a surgeon treats a tumor.
0,Fresh,One of the top adventure films of all-time; beautiful African scenery.
0,Fresh,"The Favourite is Lanthimos's most accessible film, shaped by aesthetics but driven by plot and character."
1,Rotten,"Professionally speaking, it's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller."
1,Rotten,This is a wise-guy opera with barely one memorable aria.
1,Rotten,The film progresses in a manner that's more comatose than undead.
0,Fresh,Speedy snail dreams big in fun animated comedy.
0,Fresh,"Writer/director Scott Derrickson has a touch for using old horror movie tools to create new scares, and he also incorporates several interesting themes into Sinister."
1,Rotten,"Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh is content to rely on easy jolts and an overabundance of fake-out scares, rather than hard-earned suspense."
0,Fresh,(Wells) never imagined our 21st century gadgets would be so tiny; pocket-sized streaming devices for a population more interested in gazing at navels than at stars.
0,Fresh,"The end result is akin to a surrealist spin on ''Casablanca'' that Petzold pushes through with equal parts suspense, romance and a certain degree of sly humor and which is aided by the undeniable chemistry on display between Rogowski and Beers."
1,Rotten,Boring statement about the human condition. DeNiro's a bad guy. Deal with it. And missions are barbaric. Get over it.
1,Rotten,Only for the converted.
1,Rotten,Sets the proceedings within a misty cloud of conjecture.
1,Rotten,"This is a movie of fake conflict, fake heart, even fake doggy love."
0,Fresh,"That rare film whose real-life basis is, in fact, so interesting that no embellishment is needed."
1,Rotten,"Overall, The Boss is a little half-baked. It's a middle-of-the-road comedy that feels unfinished."
0,Fresh,Life does deliver a heap of gag-inducing moments and manages to have some sneaky surprises up its sleeve despite its similarities to its genre predecessors.
0,Fresh,Surprisingly more complex than the first. Soldado explores the devastating toll of terrorism and drug-trafficking on the children caught in the crossfire.
0,Fresh,"Post-modern pastiche on the then-hip American West; fun, strange, and distinctly a product of its time."
0,Fresh,This is a movie that's smart enough to know when to be silly.
0,Fresh,"An effective, if heavy-handed, tale of redemption and forgiveness."
0,Fresh,Daniels' deft adaptation of Pete Dexter's 1996 novel is even more disturbing on screen than on the page. It's a Southern Gothic noir thriller with a terrific ensemble cast.
0,Fresh,"it's a riveting story, dazzlingly told from a female perspective, that puts the stiletto on the other foot."
0,Fresh,"As a potential future video manual which could encourage some people to become high-end criminals, it left me uneasy."
1,Rotten,It's about as manipulative a film has Steven Spielberg has ever made - a movie that's been custom-designed from the ground up to play a sad harp solo on the heartstrings; a story cynically told to invoke as many tears as possible.
0,Fresh,"Tully has forged an original independent work of spirit and intelligence, perhaps the best American feature so far in 2011."
0,Fresh,A unique achievement.
1,Rotten,"The narrative doesn't want for ambition, but Marc Webb proves unwilling, or incapable, of making this unwieldy story feel like anything but a deluge of backstory."
0,Fresh,The most appealing thing the squinty-eyed director has made since 1992's Unforgiven.
0,Fresh,...the exquisite consistency and thrill level of the Bourne trilogy continues to astonish and delight ...
0,Fresh,Renoir fashioned what might be his sweetest movie about family and one of the post-war years' most serene cinematic statements.
0,Fresh,"While it sometimes lapses into pure corn, it nevertheless manages to capture the manic-depressive dormitory atmosphere of young actresses trying to make it in New York."
0,Fresh,Director Goran Dukic keeps things simple and funny. The same tone pervades throughout.
0,Fresh,Some hilarious grouch humor once you get to at least like the guy.
1,Rotten,"Admirable attempt - but this modernist, non-linear interpretation totally lacks a formidable leading man."
0,Fresh,"For anyone who has dabbled in the creative, Harmontown is both sweet and terrifying."
0,Fresh,"'The Last Jedi' walks a fine line for fans, creating a solid standalone film that shines within the franchise canon."
0,Fresh,"Kapadia has, quite daringly, decided to rely completely on primary materials - although occasionally we hear the voices of after-the-fact observers, what we see is what happened then."
0,Fresh,"Despite this offbeat film's shortcomings, one can't help but admire director Grant Heslov and his influential pal Clooney in bringing to the screen yet another timely reminder of war's ludicrousness and ultimate futility."
0,Fresh,"Another beautifully crafted film, as well as a great London film, from the finest British director working today."
1,Rotten,It's hard to bury oneself in the picture's moody period setting when the central thrust remains that Valerie basically has to choose between Justin Bieber and a Jonas Brother.
1,Rotten,This very capable cast has absolutely no wit to work with in a screenplay co-written by Dougherty.
0,Fresh,"[Mann] revels in orchestrating confrontations between good and evil, unleashing the firepower with a merciless ferocity that Sam Peckinpah would admire."
1,Rotten,Noble intent and adherence to real events don't necessarily add up to success onscreen; it's also often tedious and schmaltzy.
0,Fresh,"The Tillman Story is one of the best, most profound and deeply affecting documentaries I've had the pleasure to see this year."
0,Fresh,A revenge flick that's just about as uncompromising as anything I've seen come out of Asia in the last decade or so.
0,Fresh,"As has been the case with many of the recent spate of Disney live-action, 3D endeavours the heart and soul which characterises [Disney's] classics just isn't present."
0,Fresh,Perhaps Searching's biggest achievement is the way it so eloquently illustrates the gulf that can exist between a loving-if-flawed father and his struggling adolescent daughter.
1,Rotten,"James Watkins can frame a fierce image along a diagonal line, but he has few tricks up his sleeve, often recycling similar shots from scene to scene, as well as spring-loaded scares that would get Roger Ebert's blood boiling."
0,Fresh,"There are many love stories folded into this film's enjoyably meandering two hours, but ""Tampopo"" is above all about the romance of food, and the joyous, agonizing devotion and hard work required to tease out its manifold mysteries."
0,Fresh,"Ash is Purest White is one of Zhangke's finer marriages between his thematic interests and form of genre storytelling, but the narrative trajectory still remains somewhat obvious, so attuned to what he's already stated repeatedly elsewhere."
1,Rotten,"As Passengers leads you further into its basic storyline, one loses track of the antiquated offenses it causes around female agency, competence and right to consent."
0,Fresh,Itself a cinematic sleight of hand...but it pulls off the trick with surprising deftness and amusement.
0,Fresh,The combination of diverse casting and female empowerment themes results in a perfectly politically correct Aladdin for these times.
0,Fresh,Formulaic fare though sufficiently entertaining.
0,Fresh,"Perros y Gatos es una pelcula 100% para nios; me refiero a verdaderos nios, es decir, menores de diez aos."
1,Rotten,"Real trauma is given the same consideration as a literal funhouse of horrors, which cheapens what the characters and audience are put through."
0,Fresh,"It's a very self aware continuation, but not a complete replicant."
1,Rotten,"The technical revels are arresting, but Seraphim Falls is slow of motive and thin of plot -- a western that dies with its boots on."
1,Rotten,"The overly-contrived basketball game finale is classic Freundlich (which is to say eye-rolling), but there are times even he, not just his excellent actors, gets things right."
0,Fresh,Audiences content with getting there as most of the fun and accepting the often preposterous contrivances of the mystery plot and its rococo conclusion will leave The Life of David Gale happy.
1,Rotten,Men sporting bronzer and spewing cliches in British accents while battling evil and dealing with cheesy special effects.
1,Rotten,"Hardly a classic, but Brown and Pollak provide decent comic relief."
0,Fresh,"For Shakespeare neophytes whose primary familiarity with the Bard has been through the cinema, watching Coriolanus may seem like unearthing a lost treasure."
0,Fresh,Blood Diamond is never dull.
0,Fresh,There's really very little to complain about in this warp-speed sequel.
0,Fresh,"The title character is a child, but two adult actors, Kathy Bates and Glenn Close, really give ""The Great Gilly Hopkins"" its considerable heart."
0,Fresh,"Auto Focus, Schrader's strongest movie since Affliction, is another meditation on American masculinity powerfully told with great wit and style."
1,Rotten,"Doubt, it appears, can be just as simplistic and dull in drama as dogma."
0,Fresh,"The film succeeds thanks to Lillard's clear affection for the material and on the strength of its performances, especially Billy Campbell as Troy's conflicted father."
0,Fresh,"The movie's amusing enough, and its plot twisty enough, that you can gloss over the half-baked elements."
1,Rotten,A go nowhere do nothing movie.
1,Rotten,"... a sloppy, indifferent action movie with a sadistic edge and a sour hypocrisy."
0,Fresh,"Complex but simple and full of life and the marionettes are wonderful. One of the best, if not the best, animated feature of the year."
1,Rotten,"As crazy as the sequel tries to be, it is about as funny as watching people eating worms on reality TV."
0,Fresh,The film's real powerhouse performance may very well come from Jake Gyllenhaal.
0,Fresh,Director DeVito has referred to this film as 'a cross between Barney and Pulp Fiction.' He wishes.
0,Fresh,"Growing up is a universal process of life to which anyone will be able to connect. ""Ping Pong Summer"" perfectly encapsulates this feeling, born out of the nostalgia of youth and times long past."

0,Fresh,"But that's Instant Family, a film that comes with all its flaws easy to see and just as easy to forgive."
0,Fresh,An incredible love story.
1,Rotten,"There's a reason this movie, with its very generic title, has managed to stay under the radar."
0,Fresh,High Life is a masterful effort to deconstruct the science fiction genre from its foundational themes. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Somber, emotionally engaging and haunting with exquisite, awards-worthy cinematography, set design and costume design."
0,Fresh,Both heartfelt and very entertaining.
0,Fresh,"The result is peculiar: I liked almost everything about the film except for the central relationship, which struck me as just an excuse for everything else."
0,Fresh,"Dark, deeply disturbing and occasionally comic, Cheap Thrills puts a contemporary spin on the cinematic version of dare, pitting a mysterious guy with a wad of cash against a financially desperate pair of blue collars."
0,Fresh,"A simmering, shimmering thriller set on the hot, dusty Italian island of Pantelleria."
0,Fresh,"Not only is there a great casual beauty in how Banana Split looks... but in the sheer goodness to be found in April and Clara's friendship, soon going bowling and shopping at thrift stores together."
1,Rotten,Another example of Reynolds accepting the wrong invitation and winding up in a role unworthy of his stature.
0,Fresh,"Funded by fans, this follow-up to the cult TV show feels a lot like an extended reunion episode. But even those unfamiliar with the series will enjoy the twisty plot and smart dialog, + the sparky Kristen Bell in the title role."
0,Fresh,"A superb British comedy, and the sleeper hit of the Toronto International Film Festival."
1,Rotten,It's fun to look at.
0,Fresh,"A clarion cry that cuts through the xenophobic clutter and the dense fog of war to show that not everyone ""over there"" is a boogeyman waiting to jump out of the closet. If that sounds terribly simplistic, just consider where we live."
1,Rotten,How can a movie starring six Academy Award-winning actors be such a bore?
0,Fresh,Builds to an explosively emotional climax that had me choking back tears as it delivered one gut-wrenching punch to the stomach after another.
0,Fresh,"Excellent, high-class genre film."
0,Fresh,"... a solid, engrossing war/action film of the old school, built around a star performance by Christian Bale."
0,Fresh,There is always the danger with a film of this high profile to expect or want it to over-deliver. Sadly - though understandably - Rogue One just doesn't do that.
1,Rotten,"Emma (2020) is lovely but only that.. It's well made, well acted, and superbly designed but when I left the theater it left me as easily as cotton candy in the rain."
0,Fresh,"It's a half-success -- a baldly conceptual response to the Leo Tolstoy novel, with a heavy theatrical framework placed around the narrative of girl meets boy, followed by girl meets train."
1,Rotten,"Sadly the film's mélange of ingredients never quite come together, and whilst Aja constantly attempts to root Hill's novel in the present, Keith Bunin's screenplay is too anomalous to hold our attention."
1,Rotten,A bloated inspirational story.
0,Fresh,Many cuts above most big-screen soap operas.
0,Fresh,Grease 2 is a film with a female protagonist who is unabashedly herself to the judgment of her peers.
1,Rotten,"A couple of touching moments aside, Valentine's Day is as blatantly engineered and resolutely frothy as mid-February date movies get."
1,Rotten,"Director Seth Gordon fails to present us with a product full of technical glitches that are very noticeable, like the visual effects used in the film, because they feel extremely false. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Pasolini's freak-out is rigorously controlled, his political vaudeville is unsurpassable"
1,Rotten,"Ostensibly we're supposed to like Pratt and Lawrence together, yet Pratt's character does something so unforgivable to Lawrence's at the outset that their ensuing interactions simmer with a mix of horror and disbelief."
1,Rotten,May give the kids nightmares but it won't turn on your 'heartlight'.
0,Fresh,The whole movie has a winning sadness about it; take away the story's sensational aspects and what you have is a study in loneliness.
0,Fresh,A captivating and worthy endeavor.
1,Rotten,Wilson-Stiller comedy revamps a 1970s TV show for a few laughs -- but just a few.
0,Fresh,"Gilliam's spellbinding vision is a chaotic, poverty-and-wealth mixture of retro, futuristic, comic book, James Bond and the original Total Recall."
0,Fresh,The best film about bullying ever made.
0,Fresh,"Despite its flaws, this is a compelling motion picture, and offers the kind of 'fresh' experience extended by the likes of Pi and The Sticky Fingers of Time."
0,Fresh,Explores the pratfalls of celebrity with the unashamed extravagance and reckless abandon of reality TV and its many characters.
1,Rotten,"It all falls flat. Not completely - there is simply too much talent involved for the film to fail completely. But man, what could have been ..."
0,Fresh,"Truthfully, I'd vote for a new title, but since that opportunity is now gone, it's best to remind potential ticket-buyers to bring down farcical expectations and prepare for something with more substance."
0,Fresh,"Such a wildly divergent story might have been told more effectively with a heaping helping of style, but Eastwood plays it safe while the screenplay is full of all kinds of innuendo and subtle dark humor."
0,Fresh,"The Furies hammers the gas out of the gate and never relents. With a strong female led cast and barbaric practical kills, The Furies stands out as an unrelenting force of slasher goodness."
1,Rotten,"If you're a Dylan fan, the music rises to the occasion -- but please spare your eyes the pain and just buy the soundtrack for that."
0,Fresh,An absolute delight from start to finish that will have viewers feeling the same kind of warm and friendly glow normally associated with a yummy pot of hunny.
1,Rotten,"If given the opportunity to see Lottery Ticket again (once was enough!), I'd break down... and buy some lottery tickets instead."
0,Fresh,You get all the weight of dishonorable people and the choices they make and the added pounds of a more modern style that probably keeps a very good film from ranking with Lumet's classics.
0,Fresh,"Painful to watch, yet it never sinks to melodrama."
0,Fresh,"The plot is predictable, but the acting holds you, especially Cusack's scary, icy, purring growl of menace."
0,Fresh,This is the best spy film to be released in several years.
0,Fresh,I had a pretty excellent time.
0,Fresh,Saves its best for last and emerges as an enjoyable and competent bit of family entertainment.

0,Fresh,A cinematic theme park ride of quite epic proportions.
1,Rotten,Spayed and declawed update of the oft-told DC Comics tale.
0,Fresh,A meticulously calibrated blending of old and new.
0,Fresh,"[Ronan] has a strange sort of expressiveness that keeps Hanna from being a dull, blank slate."
0,Fresh,"The gang's all here for a delayed reunion that packs laughter, shocks and some idiotic plot twists."
0,Fresh,"Sensvel e envolvente, o filme aborda o anti-semitismo (e o preconceito, de forma geral) atravs de uma histria simples, mas eficaz.  surpreendente como Brendan Fraser pode ser um timo ator, quando assim deseja."
1,Rotten,"Pretty Persuasion is just smart enough for scattershot humor, but not perceptive or deep enough to be meaningful."
1,Rotten,"Fans of the book, and Walls' other writing, may appreciate the film- but otherwise, there's not much reason to see it."
1,Rotten,"Rambo was always a product of Republican policy, and his sore loser, crybaby, murder fantasy is a daringly accurate reflection of the state of the Republican Party circa 2019."
0,Fresh,"The film clocks in at a beefy two hours, twenty minutes run time...it's too long for a film that otherwise has a very engaging story with two great lead performances."
0,Fresh,"If the film overall never quite works up a full head of steam, it still has enough to recommend it for viewing on a lazy summer's day."
0,Fresh,"""Gladiator"" it isn't. But it's a good solid popcorn-munchers' action flick all the same."
1,Rotten,There's certainly a lot of material there but none of the comedy works in any way at all and Keaton is a dead zone at the centre of the film.
0,Fresh,"It shouldn't work nearly as well as it does, except for one reason: Octavia Spencer, who shows what a real pro can do with a juicy role, even if it is 'just' in a horror film."
0,Fresh,"It's a hard premise to buy in to, but there's plenty of rib-tickling banter between Frost and his co-stars ..."
0,Fresh,"This overlong but absorbing murder mystery, adapted from the first of a best-selling trilogy by the late journalist-turned-crime writer Stieg Larsson, dabbles in some pretty dark material."
0,Fresh,A back-to-basics indie upstart that gets the job done well.
1,Rotten,"I don't blame the actors or filmmakers for ""Ouija"" being the worst horror film of 2014. It's the 11 narcoleptic producers who Hollywood's allowing to slap together this same tired formula. No wonder they're too lazy to make a horror film actually scary."
0,Fresh,"Nominally speaking, Another Earth is science fiction, but it's more concerned with mood and metaphysics than science."
0,Fresh,The Ring is easily the most terrifying movie to come out of Hollywood in years.
1,Rotten,Mediocre gambling drama is a pretty weak bet.
1,Rotten,Both husband and wife seem to be in way over their heads.
1,Rotten,"For a movie that spends a good amount of time exposing the bogus claims of the manufacturers of 'flame retardant' fabric, 'Merchants of Doubt' is not particularly incendiary."
0,Fresh,Can a genius and an average Joe pair up and put egos aside to serve mindless adventure? Gondry and Rogen have.
1,Rotten,"It's just director Walter Hill tweaking his formula from the ""48 Hrs."" franchise."
1,Rotten,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back does not offer enough high-octane action or clever mystery to stand out from the glut of so-so crime movies.
0,Fresh,"This delicious, seriocomic tale of four friends in affluent, liberal, west L.A. grappling with midlife crises, metrosexual spouses and household remodeling takes on an avoided subject: money, and how it affects our relationships."

0,Fresh,"It's a harrowing story, as Tamás Zányi's sound design spells out the horror left in soft focus behind Rohrig's head."
0,Fresh,"Alexandre O. Philippe is a fine filmmaker and documentarian. Memory - The Origins of Alien, however, is a bit of a class on story structure and theory."
1,Rotten,"This sentimental slog about the relationship between a golden retriever and the growing family of a race car driver is, under director Simon Curtis' no-nonsense stewardship, about as box-checked and rubber-stamped as mainstream entertainment gets."

1,Rotten,"For Love of the Game is an odd and ultimately unsatisfying mix of sport myth and romantic melodrama, like a desperate attempt to make a baseball films that girls can enjoy."
0,Fresh,Fairytale horror that is low on scares and velocity but buoyed by the syrup-thick atmosphere and the creepy stares of the young actresses.
0,Fresh,"A seriously potent psychological thriller that maximizes the suspense and violence in ways that leave you breathless. Whannell makes updating a classic look so easy, which is no small feat."
1,Rotten,"I didn't hate Another Earth so much as I found it to have begun with a fascinating sci fi premise only to produce, ultimately, a conventional relationship film."
0,Fresh,"Cinderella of the streets, both are perfect!"
1,Rotten,...there's never a point at which the viewer is wholeheartedly drawn into the admittedly simple narrative.
0,Fresh,"This is the one summer movie so far this year that really delivers in a big way. It's got bigger and better action than other bloated blockbusters, and it has bigger and better laughs that any of its comedic competition."
1,Rotten,'Sabotage' violates a cardinal rule everyone understood in the 1980s: if you are going to have a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger don't surround him with actors that are better than he is.
0,Fresh,"A broad, old-fashioned epic in the David Lean mold."
0,Fresh,"Overall a darling, unassuming film that strikes powerfully resonant emotional chords."
1,Rotten,Bonello might as well have shown him sleeping eight hours or using the toilet for all that says about the man and his work.
0,Fresh,"Here, in all its splendor, is a cinematic character as robust and colorful as ""A Confederacy of Dunces'"" Ignatius J. Reilly."
1,Rotten,The Journey deals with very rich subject matter in a disappointingly pedestrian way.
0,Fresh,"A quiet, subtle mystery whose long, penetrating takes have drawn comparisons to Andrei Tarkovsky and whose mordantly ironic conclusion may remind you of Claude Chabrol."
0,Fresh,"Comic-book adaptation has brains, brawn, and style."
0,Fresh,Hancock's film immediately and emotionally establishes itself as the definitive version.
1,Rotten,It's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller.
0,Fresh,"Less a crime or action flick than a class drama, Shanghai Triad regretfully reminds us that even those who set themselves on a path out of nameless poverty are at the whim of the men with the real power."
0,Fresh,Fast Color is extraordinary and not to be missed.
0,Fresh,"Sinha, in addition to emphasizing the harried bond of her feminine tag team drenched in decadent turmoil, shines a revealing spotlight on blue-collar working class drudgery in all its puddles of purgatory."
0,Fresh,"Super Troopers 2 is an exceedingly silly movie, which should come as no surprise since the first film is also very silly. But what separates the two films is an actual, decent plot weaved amongst rude, crude and usually very funny situations."
0,Fresh,"It's all a bit of a mess, but that's part of the point: tragedy and entertainment are intertwined, and the media ruthlessly exploits suffering for eye-grabbing headlines."
1,Rotten,Having a middle-aged male review it is probably ridiculous. So is asking its target audience to listen to a middle-aged male's opinions on the subject.
0,Fresh,A wholly unpredictable romp which culminates in a wonderfully bonkers third act.
0,Fresh,"Undeniably, though, it's an impressive debut feature from director Adam Keleman, one that promises more interesting movies going forward..."
0,Fresh,"For fans of the original, this beautiful masterwork extends the legacy ... Fans of films that are thought-provoking and lingering in both shot and effect, it's a must-see."
1,Rotten,"By now, Cho and Penn have got their Asian-American Abbott-and-Costello routine down so cold, they're a pleasure to spend time with even if the proceedings are less than inspired."

0,Fresh,"Polley is a subtle filmmaker, and a surprising one, too."
0,Fresh,...founded on a communal sense of historical accomplishment.
1,Rotten,"Minimalist retro-dialogue in Old Norse, a closeup of human defecation in real time, choked chickens for dinner, and man rape of a dumb blonde macho Viking dragged off by a native woman warrior in heat to her tepee where she, well, makes him her squaw."
1,Rotten,"To call Ready Player One superficial is irresponsible because that adjective has the word ""super"" in it. So Ready Player One is, at best, ""ficial."""
0,Fresh,"Gentle, funny and very moving, The Skeleton Twins is too late to make stars out of the already-adored Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, but is just in time to prove they've got much more to give in their hopefully very long careers."
1,Rotten,"Celebrates the bravery and creativity of Diana Prince's mastermind and his muses, but with a tepidness toward the complications of their lives. The result is a gauzy, sexy ode to unconventionality that feels distinctly and disappointingly conventional."
1,Rotten,Saunters along as if all concerned had decided that imagination and flair were either unnecessary or impossible.
0,Fresh,"[Made] with a skill and grace that lifts the material up; all of the actors, and everyone involved in the film's production, came together and made something special."
0,Fresh,Plays the enigma game out fully and well.
1,Rotten,Macy's theatrical direction has always been topnotch. So consider this a warmup.
0,Fresh,This erotic psychodrama rivals his Oldboy and Lady Vengeance in its bold color and delirious compositions but avoids the ritualized sadism that made those films such dubious pleasures.
1,Rotten,Manages to make the most intriguingly bonkers premise a boring and flat exercise.
1,Rotten,"It may not be a remake, but The Thing is certainly a rip-off."
0,Fresh,"It's not a dazzling visual spectacle, and it's not going to move anyone to tears. It is, however, the kind of sturdy, generally smart film craftsmanship that shows up far more often when a world is drawn than when it's photographed."
1,Rotten,"Gigli isn't the equivalent of cracking a whippit, but it is irredeemably flawed"
0,Fresh,"A masterpiece from first frame to last, this is easily the most emotionally touching and artistically brilliant ballet melodrama ever made (don't even mention The Turning Point), whose stature grows as time goes by."
0,Fresh,"Brad's Status remains grounded in reality - it's gentle, human and unresolved. I loved it, but I don't think I'll ever be able to watch it again."
1,Rotten,It's an only sporadically amusing piece that largely wastes the talents of a cast that deserves better.
1,Rotten,"Sara might be the victim on screen, but viewers forced to sit through her stupidity are the real victims in The Forest."
0,Fresh,"Uthaug has ably demonstrated that one doesn't need a blockbuster budget to make a world class action film, and that the potential of the new Scandinavian cinema extends far beyond noir."
1,Rotten,...never developed any sympathy for the two key players.
0,Fresh,I think they should just let Will Arnett play Batman in all of the Batman movies.
0,Fresh,"As ever with Ritchie, RocknRolla is more flash than substance, but beneath the swagger his movie scratches away at British anxieties."
0,Fresh,"""Snatched"" is a spirited early-summer trifle, not terribly deep but comically inspired where it counts."
1,Rotten,"As the boozy mountain man trying to stop the military-grade fish, Bradford Dillman acts as if he'd swallowed Charlton Heston and is now constipated."
1,Rotten,It is amazing that they can swipe a classic tale like [Pygmalion] and still add nothing but derivative tack-on flava to it.
0,Fresh,The film works because the characters act like real people rather than movie ciphers.
0,Fresh,"Instead of reality underwriting the fiction, the fiction simply loops in its endless operation."
1,Rotten,A formula comedy as affable and ineffectual as its hero.
0,Fresh,I must say that I did get quite emotional in this.
0,Fresh,"Though not one of Billy Wilder's good films, this sex farce is symptomatic of the mores of the 1950s, offering Marilyn a part that's variation of her ""dumb"" blondes."
0,Fresh,An original horror movie in an era when the genre has grown anemic. A bit too long is the only criticism.
0,Fresh,Nolan takes the Comic Book Film and Crafts a Zinger of an Art-House Film.
1,Rotten,"The Tuxedo is custom-made to showcase Chan's many tricks of hand and foot, and as such it may appeal to fans of his grueling Rush Hour comedies."
0,Fresh,"Guy Ritchie's latest is not as bad as his critics, professional and amateur, hoped."
0,Fresh,This is a chance for Reilly to strut his stuff -- so good he ought to be illegal -- in harmony or against the grain with a variety of terrific character actors.
0,Fresh,Delivers the goods on the incestuous relationship between the most powerful breast cancer advocacy group and the corporations that sustain it through the ill-gained profits made from spewing out carcinogens.
0,Fresh,"""The Wave"" feels tailor-made to spark shallow philosophical musings from stoners sitting on couches rather than offering real insight. Still, it's fun, doesn't overuse psychedelic visuals, and as a debut feature, shows off an inventive and peculiar eye."
1,Rotten,"The redeeming thing - and it's really all in Heigl's performance - is that Jane knows she's a silly cliché, and spends most of the movie inwardly wincing at her own haplessness."
0,Fresh,"Younger viewers may start squirming with boredom during the heavier debates, but there's always another cool piston-powered machine on the way."
0,Fresh,"The movie opens with the words ""a picture with a smile -- and perhaps, a tear,"" a mission statement that would serve Chaplin well over the ensuing decades."
0,Fresh,Arrietty's craft and charm will invite universal acclaim.
1,Rotten,I love gay people and I love a lot of gay movies - just not this one.
1,Rotten,"[Rob] Schneider's contribution? Well, he says 'poi poi' a lot."
1,Rotten,"The swash buckles under the weight of heavy verbiage in Robin Hood, Ridley Scott's well-intended but weakly executed retelling of the ancient woodland hero legend."
1,Rotten,"Roberts and Sarandon are immensely likable people, and Harris here seems caring and reasonable in a thankless role. We would have enjoyed spending time with them, if they'd been able to pull themselves away from the plot."
0,Fresh,"Visually stunning with video game violence, this is Hollywood's answer to The Raid."
1,Rotten,Lacks the overall sense of fear of the original and goes for a darker tone that detracts away from effective chills of Freddy's character.
0,Fresh,"All these B movie poets were under contract to RKO in the winter of 1946, and produced the best movie of everyone involved -- once seen, never forgotten."
0,Fresh,"Um filme ambicioso e maduro que, ao mesmo tempo em que impressiona com suas seqüências de ação, jamais deixa de lado o desenvolvimento de seus personagens."

0,Fresh,Creepy but slow horror show. Neat monster.
0,Fresh,"[Howards End] is an ever-pertinent, wondrous and welcome return to the big screen."

0,Fresh,At first I growled at the panda.
0,Fresh,"Although Where'd You Go, Bernadette suffers from an ungainly structure and uneven pacing, the production as a whole is engaging and uplifting."
0,Fresh,"If the director wanted to rehumanize Shepard, she has succeeded. Her other goal, though worthwhile, was not so easy to accomplish: to make sense of a horrific event and move on."
1,Rotten,This tardy rehash of fairytale tropes finds sometime genre innovator M Night Shyamalan clinging in abject desperation to the found-footage movement's careworn coattails.
1,Rotten,"""Homefront"" is hard not to like and impossible to respect."
0,Fresh,An entertaining ensembler marbled with wit and heartache.
1,Rotten,"The film itself is a strange and not entirely successful hybrid of continuation and reboot, re-introducing the character to new audiences through a story that nevertheless features multiple throwbacks to the original series of films."
1,Rotten,"The intent is almost exactly the same [as The Full Monty]. All that's missing is the spontaneity, originality and delight."
1,Rotten,Takes the post-apocalyptic themes of Children of Men and blends it with the jaded morality of Lord of the Flies to questionable success
1,Rotten,"For all the suspense the film does generate, the fairly flat climax is a disappointing payoff."
0,Fresh,"Compelling as it is exotic, Fast Runner has a plot that rivals Shakespeare for intrigue, treachery and murder."
1,Rotten,"Banderas and Hopkins prove that there's life in the Z-boy yet, but by leaving in the dull patches, the filmmakers may find audiences catching zzzzzs in ways they never intended."
0,Fresh,"It's a movie that not only puts human imperfections and incongruities on display, but also revels in them."
1,Rotten,Frank Langella and Lili Taylor give great performances in what is essentially another painfully slow and bland digitally-shot indie drama.
0,Fresh,"Regardless of its shortcomings, the film's love of its subject matter is apparent, managing to help raise the predictable into something more daring and visually exciting than it has any right to be."
1,Rotten,This sentimental father and son tale adapted from an Oliver Sacks essay by Gwyn Lurie and Gary Marks plays it altogether too genteelly for the turbulent times it depicts.
1,Rotten,"The problem with the film is that it's too long, forcing the reveal and making it a little too repetitive. [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,The Farewell is a tragic story that brings absolute joy.
1,Rotten,"[D]espite the strong performances and meticulously crafted world they exist inside, the film's narrative isn't nearly revelatory enough to match its most winning elements."
0,Fresh,"[Balances] the action... with the relationships between the different characters, their dilemmas and internal conflicts. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"There's no little hint of Kubrick and Hitchcockian paranoia to Alex Garland's debut as writer-director, a nifty, quasi-Gothic three-hander of great performances and unerring control."
0,Fresh,"Built out of crowd-pleasing elements as durable as a lacquered, sky-high '80s hairdo, writer-director John Carney's coming-of-age musical is a synth-drenched joy: a tuneful, deeply personal ode to the impulse that forges a high school rock band."
0,Fresh,"Julianne Moore, as Dr. Alice Howland, evokes the heartbreaking reality of this dreaded condition. Yet through it all, she is ""still"" Alice, and that's why Moore is a lock for the Academy Award."
0,Fresh,"American movies are running perilously low on fresh, youngish talent. Who knows what [director] Benson will do next. I just left his first movie desperate to experience the second one."
0,Fresh,"There's never a moment when Gyllenhaal the actor is on screen. Billy Hope might be his most vibrant work to date, even if the movie doesn't match up."
0,Fresh,"I'd say this is a movie about alienation that, in the spirit of the boldest activism, isn't afraid to be ostracized itself. You may beg to differ, and I'd say that's the point."
1,Rotten,"Wins an undeservedly high interest level because of what it covers, not how well it covers it."
0,Fresh,Downey is a brilliant actor who somehow manages to portray Tony Stark as traumatised without losing the character's laidback and comedic quality.
0,Fresh,"It's not often that I get to trot out this little critical bon mot, but here goes: Punisher: War Zone kicks ass."
0,Fresh,A rock-solid docudrama.
0,Fresh,"It's harsh, but it's sweetened by Toby -- he's not a real boy, but he's a classic hero."
1,Rotten,The Young Victoria feels like a wasted opportunity and is among the least impressive in a long line of motion pictures about British royalty.
1,Rotten,A tedious piece of awards bait that drains the color from both illicit sex and historical tragedy.
1,Rotten,It's the script and not Floyd that needs a shot of Viagra.
0,Fresh,"A fast-paced, big action hip-hop kung fu thriller, Cradle 2 The Grave stretches the boundaries of the genre with an engaging combo of Jet Li magic, a smart, funny script and spectacular stunts."
0,Fresh,"..never hits the easy and obvious beats of a buddy comedy; there's no sentimental bonding between man and mecha man. Similarly, though it feints toward romance, the relationship ... resolves in an unexpectedly bittersweet way."
1,Rotten,"The Invention of Lying, which Gervais wrote, directed, and stars in, is only a comedy for about 20 minutes. The rest is an atheistic treatise mocking anyone who believes there is a God and that He imposed a moral order on the world."
1,Rotten,"I just don't know what to make of a scene in which a judge sentences two selfish jerks to ""six months hard ... marriage,"" but I'm simply too old and too smart for material this insipid."
1,Rotten,"Beneath that patina of penis jokes and four-letter words beats a weak and sentimental heart that fails to deliver the film's promise of raucous fun, instead wasting a talented cast of comediennes on cliche platitudes on motherhood."
0,Fresh,"This brand refresh is woke and unwoke, deadly yet deeply unserious. You'll laugh ... and forget why before the end credits roll."
0,Fresh,Refreshingly free of those redemptive clichs that blight biopics of less controversial figures.
1,Rotten,"Moralists and the missionarily inclined will go ""Tsk, tsk, how degrading."" That seems to be Seidl's attitude, though he sidles up to it archly and pruriently."
1,Rotten,"If you are a hard core Nic Cage fan this won't kill ya, but avoiding it may make you stronger."
1,Rotten,Scan Connery is such a disappointingly wooden and boorish Bond that the script's touches of grim humour go for less than they need.
0,Fresh,"Faced with such an enthusiastic fanbase, all that director David Ellis had to do was deliver on the promise of his brilliant title, and he has done exactly that."
0,Fresh,Insanely predictable - but still a super fun ride for any Pokemon fan!
0,Fresh,Strangerland is presented through a prism of womanly wantoness juxtaposed with a mother's pain and fear.

1,Rotten,"...a meandering, relentlessly unwatchable piece of work."
1,Rotten,One of the few films you could call wildly uneven and the filmmakers would still consider it a compliment.
0,Fresh,"Approaching his lifestyle with ambivalence, the film still accords Jules enormous respect, showing an almost holy appreciation for the beautiful process of his blacksmithing work."
0,Fresh,"[Director Joshua Marston] sets us up for a complex drama, but only delivers a prologue."
1,Rotten,"Poorly directed by Joseph Sargent, who relies heavily on blood and fast editing to create tension since there certainly isn't any written into the script."
0,Fresh,This decent remake of the '80s vampire favorite should satiate horror fans.

0,Fresh,"Poignant tale of Chinese-American moms, daughters."
0,Fresh,"The movie charmed me enough to send me out smiling, and I can see younger filmgoers taking it very much to heart."
1,Rotten,"Many Hollywood films are founded on privilege, but few are as open and nasty about their racism, misogyny, and homophobia. It's a feel-good movie for people who only comfortable around people who look and act just like them."
0,Fresh,"R. J. Cutler's documentary appears to gloss over many pertinent details and the filmmaker has been accused of being too easy on Wintour, but The September Issue is incisive, detailed and somewhat cruel."
1,Rotten,The animation is masterful and the overall design is appealing.
1,Rotten,Isn't it amazing to see just how low some people will stoop if you pay them just enough money?
0,Fresh,"All this is tribute to how Schamus both respects the text, its narrative thrust and its thematic undercurrents, while allowing it to breathe and open up before us."
0,Fresh,"Boils down to the importance of facing up to what one can and can't live with, and taking action to set matters right...audiences will be able to recognize the secret agency in their own lives and the folly of living lies."
0,Fresh,Mitchum makes a perfect Marlowe.
0,Fresh,"Nolan has basically done the impossible. He's taken $200 million and, instead of coming up with a highly generic product, he's made a real movie."
0,Fresh,"Pixar has raised the bar again in ""Toy Story 4"" in that the multitude of lessons to be learned are worth not only the price of admission but perhaps a fixture in the family movie library. Yes, it's that good."
0,Fresh,"Kore-eda has unquestionably added a new, intriguing angle to his meditation on family life in contemporary Japan, complete with a haunting score from Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi."
1,Rotten,A Knight's Tale is a boil on the festering malignant state of the cinema and it should be lanced immediately.
1,Rotten,One of those sad little movies upstaged by its own vastly superior trailer.
0,Fresh,"George Romero, collaborating with writer Stephen King, again proves his adeptness at combining thrills with tongue-in-cheek humor."
0,Fresh,"It may be difficult to find a review of director and co-writer Paul King's followup to [Paddington] that does not employ some form of the word ""charming."" This is right and just, and the achievement is surely harder than the devoted cast makes it look."

0,Fresh,"Malek is so stellar in his portrayal and the music is just so good that I found myself completely entertained from start to finish. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
1,Rotten,"The growing attraction between Caine and Jupiter doesn't get much time to blossom though.Because they spend so much time running from one scene to the next, there isn't much space of characters to grow or unfold into anything compelling."
0,Fresh,"As much as it changed the people who watched movies, however, it changed the people who made movies even more."
0,Fresh,"Midsommar presents a ruthless take on the rituals of processing grief and letting go, excavating the caverns of broken relationships and the nauseous truths of why we stay in them."
0,Fresh,Many will leave disappointed by Shanley's refusal to settle for some simplistic 'Gotcha!' scene. ... But I need films that subvert my desire to divide people into white hats and black hats.
1,Rotten,There's no affection in this mean-spirited sendup of 'the business' and nothing to mitigate its sour taste.
0,Fresh,Almodvar's affection for his characters ... makes his engagingly loopy narrative more than a simple Telemundo-on-acid joke.
0,Fresh,... this story presents the West as a hard place that creates hard people and destroys the rest.
0,Fresh,One of the more sophisticated studio offerings of late.
1,Rotten,"They tried this sort of thing once before in the '80s and ended up not getting much out of it but fodder for a Kevin Smith joke. Sometimes everything old does become new again. Sometimes, like Act of Valor it just stays old. And stale."
0,Fresh,"Recommended mainly to the more devoted Singleton fans, Baby Boy is pretty strong evidence of a filmmaker who still has plenty to say."
1,Rotten,"I came to McGuckian's film knowing nothing about Gray and left feeling frustrated that I hadn't learned more about her, apart from the boorish chauvinists in her life."
1,Rotten,"Built on a foundation of melodrama and implausible coincidence, Harrison's Flowers is a movie that looks far better on paper than it does onscreen."
0,Fresh,"The brilliantly untrustworthy documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop reminds us that a film can start out in one direction and then change course so radically, it becomes an act of provocation unto itself."
0,Fresh,Simmons is unnervingly good as a teacher who rules by fear and the final showdown provides as gripping a climax as you will see all year.
1,Rotten,"Somebody OK'd Gore Verbinski's flimsy shockfest and its idiot plot based on his success with the 'Pirates' films and perhaps his spooky 'Ring' remake. Alas, now will come a real cure for such generosity quicker than the movie's preposterous running time."
0,Fresh,Some of the dialogue is witty and surprisingly poignant.
0,Fresh,The central love story involving steerage passenger Leonardo DiCaprio and rich girl Kate Winslet has lost none of its luster - metaphorically speaking.

1,Rotten,One of feature animation's greatest fiascoes.
0,Fresh,"Two brilliant performances and a script willing to let the audience piece the puzzle together for themselves, this is an inspiring tale of the bond between a parent and child."
0,Fresh,"There's a tendency for movies like Short Term 12 to be overwrought or contrived in their handling of such a sensitive story. However, Cretton avoids the pitfalls of the genre by balancing out the story with an intense and masterfully deployed empathy."
1,Rotten,"Notable for its enthusiastic abandonment of any semblance of narrative coherence. Lately, lonely women in Hollywood movies are particularly vulnerable to attacks by multiple montages and random sound effects."
1,Rotten,"If you aren't a fan of Witchcraft based horror films, this isn't going to change your mind. At times confusing, creepy, and has brief spurts of over the top bloodletting. I left wondering, what did I just watch?"
1,Rotten,"[A] witless, clueless and utterly pointless sequel to a comedy that pulled in boatloads of cash, but was beloved by absolutely no one."
0,Fresh,"Welcome back to the real world, Mr. Depp."
1,Rotten,"Every last of [Allen's] 80 years is felt in the picture's sleepy narration and leisurely pacing. He's been here, done this, toiled over all of these same spare parts before."
1,Rotten,"It never finds any kind of balance, going from tasteful but kind of dull to inane and sort of captivating."
0,Fresh,"Full of wit and humour, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a riotous animated adventure and a superb spectacle of colour and fun. It's an absolute delight from start to finish and a must-see."
1,Rotten,"Muhammad Ali may have had the ability to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, but 2013's Grudge Match can do no more than stumble around like a cockroach that's taken a direct hit from a can of Raid."

0,Fresh,"While Military Wives' plot sings to a very familiar tune, the film is still a crowd-pleaser."
1,Rotten,"Throughout, though, (James) Franco mugs as if in a silent movie and basically acts like a big kid playing dress-up. He is hardly a whiz of a wiz."
0,Fresh,"Like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Monster's Inc., it features amazing animation, great characters, sharp wit, smart humor, and a story both timeless and timely."
1,Rotten,"Isn't nearly as good as Ellis' original short, being little more than a series of vignettes masquerading as a feature film."
0,Fresh,"Hugely entertaining from start to finish, featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves, it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels."
1,Rotten,"Based on the Ray Bradbury short story of the same name, this is a colassal disapopintment - unworthy of the memorable source material."
1,Rotten,"Even the shoddiest of cliffnote 'authors' would be embarrassed over condensing a novel down to this elementary a form. Everything seems to work, but it's all too abbreviated to draw the audience in."
0,Fresh,"Keira Knightley plays Greta, a Norah Jones-like singer-songwriter... It's a typically brave performance from an actress who is always prepared to try anything."

0,Fresh,Eight Legged Freaks is a rare creature feature that actually suffers when the filmmakers try to make the human characters more like the genuine articles.
1,Rotten,The turgid accumulation of tedious sex just bores.
1,Rotten,The twisty Pulp Fiction-inspired subplot is also far less interesting than the undervalued gender crisis Cruz's angel must negotiate throughout the film.
0,Fresh,"Thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy -- smart, saucy, brilliantly-cast, superbly acted and laugh-out loud funny with pleasing regularity."
0,Fresh,It's nothing short of an absolute gift to the passionate fans of this storied franchise. The Marked Ones proves without a shadow of a doubt that Paranormal Activity is back in top form... with a wicked and evil vengeance.
0,Fresh,"If you don't flee, you might be seduced. If you don't laugh, flee."
0,Fresh,This is a movie so boldly old-fashioned that much of its true target demographic must be long dead.
0,Fresh,Any holiday movie that pokes fun at Charlie Sheen rebounding to the naughty list ('I thought he cleaned up his act!' Allen exclaims) deserves a little yuletide cheer.
0,Fresh,"I really enjoyed this. It stands on its own, and it's a fun time at the movies."
1,Rotten,"The film ultimately doesn't live up to this early potential, as Keanu Reeves loses his way in the third act with too many false climaxes."
1,Rotten,"""Jackpot"" plays like an over-the-top story told by a drunken film fan at a bar: ""Dude, I just saw this movie and it was CRAZY. You have to see it."" Trust me, you don't."
0,Fresh,"It's a work of beauty; the underwater swimming sequences have the fluidity of ballet, and it is continuously eye-catching, with a simple story line that should easily cross borders."
0,Fresh,In a World... is mild entertainment that provides a credible look inside the trailer voice world and its actor populace that makes do on the fringe of Hollywood and the big time.
0,Fresh,"A gleeful and unapologetic descent into delicious decadence, Killer Joe is proud of what it is and never tries to be something it isn't."
0,Fresh,"It's The Lord of the Rings on steroids. Shallow plot, but hey, it's based on a game so how deep can it be? Unlike some, I was able to overlook the flaws and had a good time."
1,Rotten,"Automata approximates the look and feel of idea-driven science fiction, but it doesn't have any actual ideas."
1,Rotten,"Monster Trucks is a fist-pumping love-letter to oil-guzzling, engine-revving four-wheel drives."
0,Fresh,"The problem of parsing Ned Kelly's story is at the centre of this film. To watch it, you have to brace for impact."
0,Fresh,"Crown Vic offers no ... sweeping sentiments, because it's too busy picking apart the mucky, gray morality of two men..."
0,Fresh,"First Reformed is that rare movie that questions faith from the standpoint of faith. Schrader is a believer, one brave enough to question why - or even what - he believes."
1,Rotten,"A spectacularly silly video-game adaptation about a Fresh Prince of Gel Hair who runs around the desert with a magic dagger, a curious version of Alfred Molina and some hoity-toity chick who never breaks a sweat. It's sort of pointless."

0,Fresh,"Quiet and creepy, devoid of histrionics, and with a payoff that feels earned instead of crammed down our throats."
1,Rotten,"The plotting is like uninspired Mad Libs and the premise so slight it's practically transparent. Nor is there much going on visually, beyond Jay's to-die-for loft."
0,Fresh,A wonderfully touching and brilliantly funny work that's as committed to its characters as it is to its audience.
0,Fresh,"Wyatt ... brings some bristly, swaggering energy to the thing, and that in turn may have loosened Wahlberg up: He's both more intense and freer than he's been in years."
1,Rotten,"Shot either in extreme, eye-swelling close-ups or in excessively composed, arty landscapes, I now know more about the blood vessels in these actors' noses than I care to."
1,Rotten,"An excruciating bore, a hopeless hodgepodge of the hoariest imaginable horror movie cliches...When this 'Stranger' calls, just hang up."
1,Rotten,"Although based on a true story, 'Closer to the Moon' comes across on screen as artificial and befuddling. However, quality production values make it easy on the eyes."

0,Fresh,"Plagues and Pleasures is simultaneously fun and creepy, best appreciated by those who enjoy similar profiles of Detroit's crumbling grandeur."
0,Fresh,"The story, set in contemporary Russia, seems unexceptional at the start. Yet it plays out against a vast wilderness of shorelines and lakes, and turns tantalizing ambiguity into urgent mystery."
1,Rotten,"As the movie winds on, we hear talk of a mysterious character called Georgie, and a deadly conspiracy, and pretty soon the picture devolves into an exercise in racing and chasing and predictable blam-blam-kapow."
1,Rotten,Cannery Row leans heavily into the artifice and the whimsy -- it's a strategy that's occasionally charming but more often distancing.
0,Fresh,It's all quite cute. Up to a point.
0,Fresh,The acting is much above average for action films and takes advantage of the depth of an experienced actor like Bale.

0,Fresh,An epic intergalactic masterpiece.
0,Fresh,"The film is far too long and repetitive, even though it's often gobsmacking in its frank portrayal of these truly nasty, ugly human beings who boast on television about their killings and are ready to keep on killing. Nay, keen to do so"
0,Fresh,It's an amazing piece of cinema.
1,Rotten,"It's great to see these veterans working in major roles, but a shame that the characters they play aren't more interesting."
1,Rotten,"In 2015, for the first time in the company's history, Pixar released two films. One of them was wonderful. The other was The Good Dinosaur."
0,Fresh,"When one sees Stitch, a blue blob sporting pointy teeth, an oversized head and six appendages, comparisons to past Disney works go out the window. After years of predictability, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is a crazy ride all its own."
1,Rotten,"If Friend Request was really trying to say something about the dangers of social media, there might be some value to the story. But the film either isn't interested in that, or is so bad at doing so that the message gets lost."
1,Rotten,"It's certainly not a bad movie. It's got enough entertainment value to warrant a rental on a dull night at home, just not enough to recommend rushing out to your local theater."
1,Rotten,"The Hollywood machine is so thoroughly documented in other movies, the lampooning gets stuck in a safety zone."
1,Rotten,Eventually gets bogged down in simplistic 'be yourself' moralizing destined to fail with its target audience.

0,Fresh,"The reason Balls of Fury works as well as it does, aside from its low aspirations, is because of the charm of Fogler in the lead."
0,Fresh,"Overlord is often an intense experience, even if the first act's startlingly visceral combat sequences are rather more terrifying than later horror elements."

1,Rotten,"Cannon co-executive produced so he has to accept some of the blame for the lack of laughs and thrills, leaving Hugh Bonneville to ham it up for all he's worth as the school's snobbish headmaster."
0,Fresh,"The first film was laugh-till- you-can't- remember-what- you're-laughing -at funny, while MIIB prefers gags that take a second or two to absorb but stick around the cerebrum a lot longer."
1,Rotten,"The problem with Skiptrace is that it seems as a labored and redundant rag-tag vehicle trying to bask in the shadowy spirit of Chan's typical big screen, high-wire Hong Kong police procedurals from yesteryear."
1,Rotten,"Has not a trace of what made the early episodes of the cartoon fun, and even at a slight 80 minutes, is a complete waste of time."
1,Rotten,"While military man turned director Ayer implicates our culture steeped in violence and the damaging effects of trained killing, whether by police or in war, he's assembled such a deplorable LAPD rogues gallery, it's hard to tell which one is the worst."

0,Fresh,[An] enjoyable if simplistic black comedy loosely based on a novel by Larry Beinhart.
0,Fresh,"The final big action sequence, as now seems always to be the case, is a messy and overwrought CGI extravaganza. But at least the movie that precedes it involves actual characters-likeable ones, even!-exhibiting recognizable human emotions."
0,Fresh,At least P2 has a little bit of psychological thrill to it.
0,Fresh,Charlize Theron transforms into a husky street survivor... the kind of stunt that gets Oscar nominations. Theron turns it into a bristling performance that deserves them.
1,Rotten,"An overgenerous helping of recapitulation, a long procedural that's more about Lisbeth's persecutors and protectors than about her."
0,Fresh,"As action-packed as it is, the quiet moments work best and, like 2011's First Class, the superhero universe of the X-Men is a cut above its comparatively cheesier brethren."

1,Rotten,"Food, Inc. director Robert Kenner has turned it into a redundant, formally uninventive, Food, Inc.-like documentary"
0,Fresh,"Gripping in its unsentimental clarity of vision, startling in its portentous ruminations on belief, sacrifice, and nature, ""First Reformed"" is unsparing even as it spares, a cinematic jolt of agony and transcendence."
1,Rotten,"Tomorrowland has the ragged, jagged feel of a tale that was reworked countless times on the page, during production and in the editing room."
0,Fresh,"A funny, factual, and heartbreaking chronicling of what happens when man and God work in harmony to doom a film in mid-birth."
1,Rotten,"It's by no means a good film -- really, it's Dennis Miller versus undead prostitutes -- but b-movie fans shouldn't overlook it just yet."
0,Fresh,"New York Times senior art critic Michael Kimmelman offers sharp insights when he mentions how Marla's painting reflects not just 'innocence' and what our psyches project into them, but also 'the cynicism of the art world.'"
1,Rotten,Director Lasse Halstrom and cinematographer Sven Nykvist do their best to disguise the predictability with their own grace notes. But all the music in the world can't hide a tone this false.

1,Rotten,"Even when the movie tries to pull a fast one, like most illusions, the explanation is nowhere near as intriguing as the deception."
0,Fresh,"Despite a lack of in-depth special features, No is still easy to recommend for its fascinating story that tells of a country getting the unique opportunity to decide its own future."
0,Fresh,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is James Gunn's version of a Marvel Universe Empire Strikes Back: A film that retains everything the audience loves about the preceding movie, yet going deeper to expand the characters and story for further exploration."
0,Fresh,There are moments of considerable power here but this stripped-down rendering gives us something closer to a latterday dysfunctional family than Chekhov's doomed bourgeoisie.
0,Fresh,...one of the most interesting movies on a purely visceral level to come around in a while.
0,Fresh,"Each frame seems to tell a story. The movie may be almost two hours, but Sorrentino insists that not one moment is wasted."
0,Fresh,"Lucky thing that somebody put to film the agreeable tour of the Dos Amigos, in ""Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life""... But there are a lot of grins in the banter, songs, bits and dances."
0,Fresh,"Phoenix Forgotten does an admirable job of blending fact and fiction, and overall, co-writer/director Justin Barber crafts an intriguing sci-fi-fueled mystery that hooked me from the very beginning."
1,Rotten,"Time for Coppola to get out of her comfort zone, maybe adapt a novel."
0,Fresh,...what audiences are going to leave salivating for is a series of exponentially [awful] sequels that cut out the emotional undercurrents and focus on what really matters: Octavia Spencer excitedly slaughtering annoying kids...
0,Fresh,"Mixing a range of genres, Their Finest is a likeable crowd-pleaser that offers drama, comedy and romance."
1,Rotten,"If anything, this blood-spattered, stomach-churning sequel to last year's serial-killer thriller is even more moronic, more overplotted and more convoluted."
1,Rotten,"The Prophet is baffling and frustrating, and I can't recommend it because I do not know who this is meant to appeal to. Just read the book."
1,Rotten,True...the odds were stacked against Raimi in his film that has some moments but hardly seems momentous.
0,Fresh,"Scent, fine acting, + superb cinematography carry you through. However, you can't help but feel you've been cheated out of a truly devastating drama by folks in search of something more commercially palatable and, consequently, less plausible."
0,Fresh,"There's a lot of fun waiting at We Bought a Zoo, but it's the feelings that run through every scene that'll make you glad you came."
0,Fresh,"It's filled with intriguing characters, it has a fascinating initial premise -- and then it runs off the rails."
0,Fresh,"There are so many clever lines and bits of physical comedy worth revisiting that the movie seems like a likely cult classic, but it's more inclusive than that."
0,Fresh,"Lords of Chaos is well acted and worth watching for anyone with a passing interest in the source material, but Åkerlund's subtle direction fails to conjure much tension or sense of dread-something sorely needed to tell this story."
1,Rotten,May be one of the most worthless remakes in recent memory and this is coming from someone who didn't hate Len Wiseman's Total Recall.

0,Fresh,It's a brand of exploitation that feels surprisingly fresh considering how many tropes it recycles.
0,Fresh,"Bug can't decide if it's a woman-in-peril noir thriller or a modernist paranoia saga, so it just gets weirder, bloodier, and grosser."

1,Rotten,"Even more boring than it was the first couple of times...a cross between Mad Max and Day of the Dead, though markedly inferior to both."
0,Fresh,"Visual elements draw from a theatrical vocabulary, such as a besorrowed M overlooking gray London at a window slashed with billions of cold tears, match-cut to wounded Bond cascading over a waterfall like a spent package."
0,Fresh,"The jokes may not make you guffaw, but are carried out with a subtle, understated sense of timing and characterisation that will surely leave you with a quietly satisfied smile stretching from ear to ear."
1,Rotten,"The protagonist might be so laid-back that he practically disappears, but the picture itself tries much too hard--and stumbles."
1,Rotten,"The kind of terrible that doesn't wash out, destined to be remembered among the pantheon of big budget bombs like ""The Adventures Of Pluto Nash"" and ""Cutthroat Island."""
0,Fresh,"The emphasis on identity politics and the social critique of White America, gives Coogler a little space to fashion something distinctive - a different flavour of Marvel movie if you will, with a great new taste, even if the ingredients are well known."
1,Rotten,"Before we enter the theater, we know he's a millionaire winner starring in a movie about how he won. So it's hard to believe him when he isn't smiling."
1,Rotten,"It's an interesting choice, but it isn't handled in a compelling way."
1,Rotten,"The truly scary thing about Silent Hill is that it's 127 minutes long, which means it's a good 20 to 30 minutes longer than most of the other similarly awful films inspired by video games."
0,Fresh,"It's a special feature, rich with character and perspective, and it showcases what Jenkins is capable of, especially with difficult tales of lives lived in a constant state of fear."
0,Fresh,"The story combines wickedly wry humor with enchanting steampunk spookiness. Green, with her flashing eyes and menacing grin, is perfect for this quintessentially Burtonian role."
1,Rotten,"This is a movie with no wit, no imagination, and no laughs throughout its two tedious hours."
0,Fresh,A Quiet Placeis a thoroughly relatable thriller laced with horror-movie tropes. Perhaps that's why it works so well even for a wimp like me. The movie runs 90 minutes and is thoroughly satisfying. Other filmmakers would do well to take note of this.
0,Fresh,"Sketchy as it can be at times, The Heart of the Game keeps us involved."
1,Rotten,[John Woo] sacrifices logic and narrative coherence with less hesitation than one of his villains would display in shooting an accomplice to avoid apprehension.
0,Fresh,"Kinetic, knowing, crammed with high-tech gadgetry and sophisticated in the most superficial sense of the term: What else could you ask of a James Bond picture?"
0,Fresh,"The film is stirring and moving and occasionally harrowing, needless to say, and it achieves its objective of powerfully documenting a short span of history that must not be overlooked"

1,Rotten,"Sadly, Hazanavicius is so unskilled, so steeped in the empty signposting of parody and stereotype, that he's actually signaling to us throughout The Artist that we're watching a quaint old art form Lindy Hopping its way to the bone yard."
1,Rotten,Paul W.S. Anderson gets a far better cast than he deserves for the crash-and-bang spectacle.
1,Rotten,"Michael Crichton, author of Sphere, co-produced the messy, convoluted version of his best seller, which starts out promisingly enough but soon gets bogged down with bad exposition and cliched dialogue."

1,Rotten,"There's an intriguing idea here, but this thriller feels like it has been compromised in the test-screening phase, resulting in a badly muddled plot."
0,Fresh,A delightful melding of visual style and narrative pirouettes.
0,Fresh,"But at least Fallen Kingdom considers the idea of letting go, making it a more thoughtful and interesting film than its immediate predecessor."
0,Fresh,"As an off-beat movie that depends on his conversational delivery, Sleepwalk with Me manages to avoid many of the standard romantic comedy pratfalls."
0,Fresh,Comic fans might as well book second viewings of what's arguably one of the best Spider-Man films to grace the big screen.
0,Fresh,While Source Code is chugging along it's a terrifically entertaining puzzle movie. Let's not squander that by thinking too much.
0,Fresh,It is in that tone of satire and nightmare where the film knows how to situate its static dummies. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"For much of its 122 minutes, Gunn's grab-bag of quirky characters, genre ribbing, and incongruent '70s pop tunes goes over like gangbusters. The trouble is, it's only irreverent to a point."
1,Rotten,"Put simply, it's not a great film but it's still watchable."
1,Rotten,"In this utterly formulaic romantic comedy, even Greece's gorgeous sites and Vardalos' mildly appealing persona can't compensate for the pile of national stereotypes and cultural cliches (stuffy Brits, boozy Aussies, loudmouthed Yanks)."
1,Rotten,"If you truly love yourself, do yourself a favour and avoid this spiritless comedy."
0,Fresh,This is a jewel of American cinema.
0,Fresh,"The fierce passion from the performer, Buckley, creates tangible electricity... Wild Rose fits the bill for a British indie, yet apart from Buckley's radiance it sadly does not offer anything more or less."
0,Fresh,"Streep and Jones are pure magic. The fear, the longing, the tenderness of these characters are beautifully illuminated in performances of exquisite understanding."
0,Fresh,"While the Coens' film is more astringent and lacks Hathaway's sweetened ending, it does not wander off down black trails in pursuit of violent quirk."
0,Fresh,"The movie rarely flags, but it is hard to get past the notion that what is onscreen is nothing more than an artfully made home movie and that the Gondry family saga is no more interesting than that of the average loving, if somewhat dysfunctional family."
0,Fresh,"Condensing five short juvenile novels into a single 90-minute film, the screenwriters have done a decent job of constructing a tale that will entertain tots without insulting parents' intelligence."
1,Rotten,"It's not offensive, just anemic. And even Coach Billy Bob can't whip it into shape."
0,Fresh,"Though undeniably slight, Brian Herzlinger's endearingly enthusiastic documentary My Date With Drew makes a pretty good case for the underdog."
0,Fresh,"It's what your own brain fills in that makes The Innkeepers so chilling and effective, and [Ti] West knows it."
0,Fresh,"Could certainly be a whole lot worse, and this is something I clung to as no uncertain comfort during the film's 104 minute running time that feels a good deal longer."
0,Fresh,"Ali Wong's Baby Cobra rises above the crowded surface, due in part to her sharp, fearless writing, and also because she recorded the set while seven months pregnant."
0,Fresh,"While Pavarotti is a celebration of the bloke who sold more than 100 million albums and played to audiences in excess of 10 million, it's not just a trawl through his successes - or a hagiography."
0,Fresh,The movie proudly wears its affection for crusty Sergio Leone archetypes and countdown-clock suspense sequences; Carpenter was Tarantino long before Tarantino was.
0,Fresh,"Nausica, princess of the Valley of the Wind, is a screen heroine--or, rather, hero--for the ages."
0,Fresh,Mud clearly sets out from frame one to run along well-worn tracks - it's like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn meets Whistle down the Wind.
0,Fresh,"This is an old-fashioned film about romance that dares to play out like the love affair it depicts. It sweeps the viewer up in its embrace, whirls them from one emotional extreme to the next, leaving them exhilarated."
1,Rotten,Has no idea what story it wants to sell or the message it wants to say.
1,Rotten,"Full of cliches, this tired Western is one of Wayne's weakest films, made in the same year he appeared in the Oscar-winning True Grit."
0,Fresh,"The less you know about the plot the more the fun, suffice to say that Homecoming trades adolescent angst for hit-the-spot humour (top work from co-stars Jacob Batalon and Zendaya) and throws in some surprises 'twixt webs and wisecracks."
0,Fresh,"Even if it serves up the happy ending audiences apparently insist upon, the good in The DUFF mostly outweighs the stuff you've seen before."
0,Fresh,"As action pulp, the venture gets a very solid, if far-from-perfect, working over from Thor director Kenneth Branagh, the former Shakespearean darling who is clearly relishing his stomp into the mainstream."
1,Rotten,"The classic teen movies tend to resonate more with actual teens, but while high schoolers may find this movie unbelievably innocuous, it's a sweet enough diversion for young'uns and the parents who have to accompany them."
1,Rotten,Getting the sociopolitical context so wrong might approach being forgivable if the central romance between Baby and Johnny weren't also botched.
0,Fresh,"A warm-hearted, funny, well-crafted coming-of-age story."

1,Rotten,Making the audience wish they were seeing an old Hulk Hogan movie is simply sad.
1,Rotten,"It's gross, it's mean-spirited, it thinks it's being funny most of the time but ends up just being obnoxious, and worst of all it squanders a very good Mads Mikkelsen performance."
1,Rotten,"Such a hit-and-miss mess that it makes the wild-and-crazy-to-the-point-of-sometimes-flailing tenor of ""Anchorman"" and other such Ferrell vehicles feel like finely-tuned Logitech vehicles."
0,Fresh,A rousing if retro adventure film about soldiers and honor and brotherly love.
0,Fresh,"As a complete work, Robot Stories is a solid collection."
1,Rotten,[The] comedy is agreeable almost to a fault ... what's left is a film that-while easy to digest-is almost completely flavorless.
0,Fresh,"This film isn't about a farting corpse, it is about questioning what's normal and being bold. When you have this in mind, you begin to see the complexity and thoughtfulness which makes Swiss Army Man great."
0,Fresh,"It's the experience, more than the story, that's worth celebrating here."
0,Fresh,Sometimes humorous and wholly inspiring tale.
0,Fresh,"It's a throwback girl-with-a-gun exploitation tale, as well as an evolved feminist fable; and an impeccable dissection of gun control, as well as a wicked mockery of NRA mentality."
1,Rotten,This well-intentioned family film unfortunately comes off as shallow as a prom committee meeting.
1,Rotten,"That sea lion sure is cute, though."
1,Rotten,The straw-man arguments made here skew towards caveman us-versus-them idiocy.
1,Rotten,An overzealous need for detail just confuses the outcome into a pile of mess. This is a Bogart we hope they can stupefy in the next instalment.

1,Rotten,An air-brushed portrait of a repulsive millionaire
1,Rotten,A relentlessly dull chase flick with an inexplicably high-toned cast.
1,Rotten,"Stilted dialogue, ridiculous storyline and spurting arteries combine for a very ugly filmgoing experience."
1,Rotten,"Perhaps even more egregious than its inherently repulsive premise is the fact that The Human Centipede 3: The Final Sequence is cinematically constipated... nothing happens for a long, long time; and when it does, it's just crap."
0,Fresh,"[F]rustrating and fascinating... Backstory? Forget it. Motivations? Never mind. This is a movie that exists completely in its own moment -- not in the past, not in the future."
0,Fresh,"I'll hate to see these old fogeys go, of course, but the time may have come to once again pass the torch."
1,Rotten,"This is a deeply conservative movie, not conservative in a political way but conservative in a Ward-and-June-Cleaver kind of way..."
0,Fresh,"If you can handle the torrent of grisly violence, you'll find yourself royally entertained by this Hong Kong actioner."
0,Fresh,"There's probably a better film to be made about the Krays, but Legend has two Tom Hardys and an Emily Browning doing exemplary work. In this case, that's enough."
0,Fresh,"Grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing, raffish charm and piercing intellect."
0,Fresh,"Burton has the right eye for the pop magnetism of the Keane paintings and for the period kitsch, and Adams' unique brand of fragile spunk is right for the role of Margaret."
0,Fresh,"Chastain is killer good, and Isaac is an implosive powerhouse in a film that reflects a world where nothing is held sacred. You watch with nerves clenched, holding on tight."
1,Rotten,How any studio head figured Mr Rock could carry a big-budget vehicle on his own is simply mind-boggling.
0,Fresh,"Can Eating Animals really enact substantial change? While I do believe the message here will be lost [like many others], it at least introduces viable alternatives."
0,Fresh,Soderbergh has done a brute and fanciful thing with... a political provocation not so much torn from the headlines of top-shelf newspapers but ripped from the pages of activist theater and in-your-face agit-prop.
0,Fresh,"In Hustlers there's a female gaze on a female story, which influences the type of humor, the portrayal of the friendship between the characters, and the way the female bodies are filmed. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"The film-makers are predictably making much of the allegedly prophetic nature of their bankers-as-villains storyline. Nice try. At its heart, The International is just another tale of a flawed idealist tangling with faceless corporate evil."
0,Fresh,A generic thriller that happens to be wrapped in political packaging. That packaging is sometimes more interesting than the thrills themselves.
0,Fresh,"As for the movie itself, it's a handsome, solid thriller, with terrific performances throughout."
0,Fresh,If you enjoy good thought provoking sci-fi then you should really enjoy this movie.
1,Rotten,"...a passably enjoyable slab of schlock that works best when tacked on to the tail end of a Drive-In double feature, especially when viewed after several six packs of bottom shelf beer."
0,Fresh,"A contender for one of my favorites of 2007, and damn near superior to its predecessor..."
1,Rotten,French farce doesn't come more sentimentally skewed than in co-writer/director Radu Mihaileanu's musically bound European dramedy.
1,Rotten,As visually electric as it is conceptually stupid.
1,Rotten,"It certainly is a work of nostalgia, but it never bothers to add anything new to the proceedings. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"The television ad spots and theatrical trailers for The Guardian apparently tell most, if not all, of the film's story in just a minute or two."
1,Rotten,"When Binder isn't stuck on message, the picture has a breezy, inconsequential charm. But in at least two unforgivably manipulative scenes the movie asks us for feelings that it has not yet earned."
0,Fresh,"The movie is more entertaining than it is logical; its narrative leaps are sometimes ahead of our ability to believe them. But as the compellingly enigmatic Pierre, Pinon keeps us rapt."
0,Fresh,"While it does trade-in the video game franchise's lively environments for road trip cliches, Sonic and Jim Carrey provide plenty of fun for the whole family."
0,Fresh,"'Cautivadora, sorprendente, impresionante. Demuestra que el límite del ser humano es su propia imaginación'"
1,Rotten,"This is easily the worst film of the year so far, and frankly last year too. It is embarrassingly, painfully unfunny."
0,Fresh,"... about loneliness, whether your life is on hold taking care of an ill parent or you're a centuries-old vampire...proof that the vampire film genre is anything but dead."
1,Rotten,"A mountain of craft has been applied to a molehill of a story, and result is a film that fills your eyes with genuine cinematic magic, even as it treats you like a featherhead."
0,Fresh,"The film does have its warm, beating heart."
1,Rotten,Luketic neither commands the kind of broad satirical strokes heir to Alexander Payne or the low-key absurdist touches that mark the works of Wes Anderson.
0,Fresh,"Arrival, which aims to touch rather than to excite, looks inward. The film about aliens, it proposes, is in fact a way to look at the human race, the good and the bad in us (mostly the bad)."

1,Rotten,The Hunt has very little to recommend outside of a few good gore gags and Betty Gilpin delivering the goods.
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, a likeable cast, [Mark] Rylance's performance is especially memorable, an imaginative story and Spielberg's ability to meld mirth, mystery and pop culture ensure that Ready Player One is a must-see."
1,Rotten,"Over the course of the film, many funny, gory and silly -- but not particularly horrifying -- events occur."
0,Fresh,"... as if by magic, everything comes together in a super weird but completely functional story. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,What must not be forgotten is this is an entertaining piece of imaginary work in itself - as suggested by the opening prologue by Derek Jacobi.
1,Rotten,"There is often a shallow, tabloid feel to this biographical film."
0,Fresh,"A good, if simple, reminder that grace truly is amazing, especially when we've walked in the shadow of death."
0,Fresh,"Its plot feels quite generic for the genre, but its incorporation of Indigenous imagery and culture, and overall representation, makes this zombie horror feel like something special."
0,Fresh,Hollywood nearly ruins a great true story like The Blind Side by piling on the schmaltz.
0,Fresh,Episode III hooks up to its sequel of 1977 as neatly as a space station landing dock.
1,Rotten,"Far from reprehensible, The Rise of Skywalker manages initially to evoke frustration, which evolves to a profound apathy defined by questions of what could've been."
0,Fresh,"Make the leap, and you'll be delighted by a movie that's sugary goodness, a guilty pleasure."
1,Rotten,Any idiot can make us wince at the ugliness of beatings and shootings.
0,Fresh,"The exercise isn't entirely successful, but still proves eminently watchable, indeed almost hypnotic -- something only HBO, frankly, would likely bring to the screen in such cerebral, uncompromising form."
0,Fresh,"If you're any kind of Pixar fan, I think you'll find it enjoyable on some level."

1,Rotten,"If nothing else, this might be the most heartwarming film ever made about masturbating into a plastic cup for money."
0,Fresh,"I can't get it out of my thoughts, and I recommend it highly."
0,Fresh,"Beautifully-crafted sci-fi entry in the ""found footage"" genre is both as wondrous and monotonous as deep space travel."
0,Fresh,"The dream of every director tasked with bringing such a difficult story to life is to have a star who can carry the drama, and in her feature debut, Rosendahl is a revelation."
0,Fresh,"It affirms that change is inevitable, and even in this weird and fascinating universe of talking toys, love lives on in the next generation."
1,Rotten,The rest of the kid's tricks are too unimaginative to be much fun -- though with jokes this lame you won't have to worry as much about your children getting any bad ideas.
0,Fresh,"If kids aren't drawn to one singing animal (or familiar voice), there's always another around the corner, holding up the tentpole."
1,Rotten,"If this movie is uncharacteristically radiant (and, my, is it), then it's also aloof and unexpectedly ordinary."
0,Fresh,"I doubt I would be able to find ten things I hate about 10 Things I Hate About You, but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten."

0,Fresh,"Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim is awesome, scary, weird, exciting, exuberant, and ridiculous -- basically everything you want from a sci-fi action movie."
1,Rotten,"I have seen many stupid movies in my life. But [this] would still count among the stupidest, had I seen twice a many movies in half again as many genres."
1,Rotten,85 minutes doesn't provide an adequate format for developing seven distinct characters.
0,Fresh,"It's why the blatant melody of this movie seems to have touched a cord at the beginning of 2019, at the first fiercely ""independent"" film festival of the year - they stand for the same values and inclusion."
1,Rotten,"Pod is able to find tension, but it's just too undercooked."
0,Fresh,"Simply put, it is a pleasure to watch and a film that I'd gladly see again."
0,Fresh,"This isn't a new golden age of martial arts films, but with Yen holding down the fort in China and southeast Asian fighters Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa, it's a pretty good one."
0,Fresh,Just extraordinary filmmaking... This is how you can use modern film techniques to create a fantasy world of wonder.
0,Fresh,"It offers shreds of hope, something we can cling to even now."
0,Fresh,"There were enough hints of Coens, a glimpse of Wes Anderson and a coating of Clooney's sense of humour here for me to have a really fun few hours with this grotesquely daft black comedy."
0,Fresh,"Only the strangely coy approach to violence (deaths are nearly all offscreen), leaves an odd aftertaste, but not enough to taint the big dumb fun."
1,Rotten,"Throughout, the people on-screen -- from the Bielskis to the huddled masses they shelter -- feel less like flesh and blood people than stock characterizations designed to forward a specific ideological agenda or plot point of the movie."
0,Fresh,"A film that, for all its pretensions and intermittent power, is essentially high-grade claptrap."

0,Fresh,"It's serious about its characters and their emotions, but still finds room for humor."
0,Fresh,"Selim erases the cultural barrier between the eras and makes Olaf and Inge's tentative, forbidden romance seem as beautiful and as tender, and as urgent, as anything that might happen in the present day."
0,Fresh,Wispy threads of dramatic plausibility and character involvement unravel completely by the time of the incredibly silly final reel.
1,Rotten,Stale and clichd to a fault.
1,Rotten,"It cuts back on the rapid-fire pop culture references that dominate the other films to focus on the story, but unfortunately, the story isn't all that interesting."
0,Fresh,"Surprisingly, 'Dawn of the Dead' is actually a pretty good film in its own right...as a gory action-horror movie, it gets the job done with speed and efficiency..."
0,Fresh,"It's by far the best movie adaptation of a comic book, ever."
1,Rotten,"Bottom line, I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to."
0,Fresh,"There isn't a lucid moment in it (and much of the dialogue is rendered unintelligible by Russell's subversive direction), but it has dash, style, and good looks, as well as the funniest curtain line since Some Like It Hot."
0,Fresh,"I liked the seriousness with which it has been made, the willingness to grant deep feeling to its young characters, and the way it avoids of a lot of the cliches... but the failure to enchant in the scenes in the woods leaves a hole."
1,Rotten,If you've come 2/3rds of the way through a series like The Matrix odds are you're going to see it through to the end
0,Fresh,"A magic-realism golf pastoral, a stunningly lovely film with few faults."
0,Fresh,"The film's absurdly dark humor comes with a price tag, and after a while the continuously mindless and pointless killings begin to exact a numbing toll on the viewer."
1,Rotten,There is something depressingly stunted about this movie; something desperate too.
1,Rotten,An ugly film whose ambitions are never matched by its creators' limited abilities.

0,Fresh,"You should expect the unexpected and that's what we get as a traditional horror movie set up gives way to some droll, increasingly bonkers post-modern nonsense..."
0,Fresh,"Loud, fun, and with a soundtrack that complements the film in all the right ways, ""Baby Driver"" is like being on a roller coaster, with its twists and turns coming quick and a feeling of exhilaration unlike any other."
1,Rotten,The brothers swamp the fragile story and characters with such a deluge of CGI tricks and elaborate action sequences that it proves hard to care about the humans on screen.
0,Fresh,"For the most part, this hilarious caper's gay characters are knee-deep in the American mainstream."
0,Fresh,Davies tries things nobody else would try. Here that means allowing the choral passages - scenes in which individual characters and groups of characters express their feelings in popular ballads or folk songs - plenty of room.
0,Fresh,As technically complex and masterful as any war film I can remember.
1,Rotten,"It plays like a mad dash across the cerebral mind-field in search of the right mood, and fails drastically at finding one."
1,Rotten,"What's not to love, after all, about a therapist who calls a mentally unbalanced man crazy to his face? But it's also an appropriate response to both Walter the movie and Walter the ridiculous construct of a movie character."
1,Rotten,"I'm tempted to suggest it was made for 13-year-old boys, but I remember being 13, and I'd have been offended if anyone had suggested movies this awful were made for me."
1,Rotten,"It's a flat, lifeless story with a flat, lifeless lead. Humans are flawed, humans are beautiful, the Earth is dying ... it really feels like we've been here before."

0,Fresh,"Even the most seemingly benign scenes posses a low level of fear, and the final hour is heavy enough to leave audiences shaking (and shaken)."

1,Rotten,Just should've been about the Cubs.
1,Rotten,"This sporadically adorable, mostly forgettable family comedy exploits the fetching premise outlined in its title for the first five minutes. Then, it reminds you why Illumination Entertainment is no Pixar."
0,Fresh,"Despite the odds, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole may be the season's most dramatically compelling and most visually sumptuous animated feature. Who could have predicted that?"

0,Fresh,"One of the most purely pleasurable, delicious films currently available."
0,Fresh,"Given the absence of any real freshness or inspired surprise here, it really should have been shorter, but at least the actors play those familiar characters with an energetic conviction."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, despite the subject's import, rookie director Yang shows his inexperience with a needlessly confusing and fractured flashback-filled technique...which keeps one at arm's length from the dramatic involvement."
1,Rotten,"While we can't presume to know the Lord's mind, somewhere in the footnotes to the Ten Commandments there must be a rule about not using insipid piety to excuse incompetent comedy."
0,Fresh,"The Losers is, above all else, fun, and that fun means that the things that don't work about it seem terribly unimportant. It moves, it's got attitude, and it is frequently laugh-out-loud funny..."
1,Rotten,An aptly lush but below-the-numbers yarn
0,Fresh,"This Elmore Leonard adaptation doesn't inspire ardor, but it certainly boasts above-average intelligence and a streak of knowing unpredictability that make the dark comedy a pleasurable morsel of escapism."
0,Fresh,A surprisingly good example of Hollywood's craftsmanship.
0,Fresh,"The only way to properly see Lean's overstuffed epic is on the big screen, the better to appreciate the glorious desert vistas, Maurice Jarre's soaring score and the glowing performance by then-unknown Peter O'Toole as a messianic T.E. Lawrence."

0,Fresh,"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot isn't dull, and it has its highlights. It just isn't a revelatory portrait of Callahan or his work, just a helpful look at how AA can help a soul in distress."
1,Rotten,"I once saw a high school production of 'Grease' where they had some technical difficulties and had to stall for time, so the director sent the main actors onstage, in character, to improvise a scene. 'Little Fockers' feels like 100 minutes of that."
0,Fresh,Un digno retrato de época - no exento de ciertas simplificaciones - que logra recuperar con interés un período histórico y una figura olvidada como la de Hipatia (buena labor de Rachel Weisz).
1,Rotten,"A dreary, ludicrous thriller."

1,Rotten,"A middling picture at best, it reveals some interesting inner workings of the Secret Service. At worst, it plays like a boring night of TV watched at your mom's."
1,Rotten,There are parts of Gemini Man that look so tangible and real that it's as if we could reach out and touch Will Smith - but this fidelity to absolute realism seems to erase the cinematic artistry.
1,Rotten,"There are a couple of bravura, action scenes that crackle with ingenuity and excitement, but all too often, Renaissance plods when it should sprint."
0,Fresh,One of the most entertaining war movies of the past 20 years.
1,Rotten,"Lust, Caution wants us to feel the erotic ping of buttoned-up people ripping open those buttons, but too often it's the film's drama that's under wraps."
0,Fresh,...my choice for Joel and Ethan Coen's masterwork.
1,Rotten,"The Rite gets it all wrong. With a lopsided story line, an untested lead actor (no it's not Anthony Hopkins) and an are-we-there-yet wait for the good stuff to start, this thriller barely thrills at all."
0,Fresh,"The final act, where secrets become revealed and the plot twists in on itself once more is ingeniously clever."
0,Fresh,Thank god that Woo left Hollywood. This is the masterpiece he was destined to make.
1,Rotten,"For Sarah, Will, and his leg sidekick, the maze of characters they must navigate is the tedious space between crazy scenes where anything, anything, anything can be saved with duct tape."
1,Rotten,"But self-consciousness is not the same thing as self-awareness. And in a movie overflowing with the former and lacking in the latter, Jim primarily becomes an inadvertent symbol of narcissism and superficiality."

0,Fresh,Jennifer's Body is horror thrown back at us with it's tongue firmly in its cheek and its conventions open for all to see.
1,Rotten,"It's not ok to make three hours of graphic sex, epic drug binges, and general debauchery as boring as it is in The Wolf of Wall Street."
1,Rotten,"The goals of the picture never come into focus, usually because it is too busy bouncing between the methodical deviations of the villain and the silent absurdity of injustice."
0,Fresh,"Onward gets its job done and presents themes and questions that are interesting to consider, and if it feels too ambitious for its own good, it's doing more than most of the other films currently in theatres."
1,Rotten,"Attracting an array of lovers and male admirers, from too young to too married there's more philosophizing than romance or sex, some verge on selfish clichés of rom coms."
1,Rotten,"UglyDolls has a cute story, with great lessons for kids, but feels like a not-as-good combination of Trolls and Toy Story."
0,Fresh,The script needs more nurturing but Noomi Rapace takes up some of the slack in Pal Sletaune's maternal mystery.
0,Fresh,"Jeunet,... has both a pictorial imagination and a healthy sense of irony, qualities that may not have viewers on the edge of their seats but do tend to make ""Resurrectoin"" quirky fun."
1,Rotten,"This deliberately tasteless horror-comedy might appeal to gore hounds and fans of gross-out humor; but as with many films that strive for cult status, any potential exploitation-movie pleasures are overwhelmed by an air of smug self-awareness."
0,Fresh,"The Stooges story has been told before and you can still hear the mighty roar of bug-eyed defiance on their three key albums but Jarmusch reckons it's time to revisit this tale of drugs, burn-out, more drugs, and peanut butter all over again."
0,Fresh,"It's full of tension and chills, especially when the audience doesn't know what's in the woods and the group is coming apart at the seams ... or ribcage."
0,Fresh,"Gathers up an eclectic range of influences... and pushes them rambunctiously forward, into a genre that might be described as intersectional screwball science fiction."

1,Rotten,What starts off as a potentially charming fantasy never finds its footing.
0,Fresh,"Clearly, Sherrybaby is tender, psychologically complex, perceptive and resoundingly redemptive in its reflection of womanly angst."
1,Rotten,"For a movie like this to work, it has to set certain ground rules...but Frequency plays by ear, and the result is a discordant symphony."
1,Rotten,"As always, Phoenix is an arresting presence on screen, but don't expect any Departed-esque fast talk from Wahlberg, who is oddly inert in a role that should crackle with brotherly ambivalence."

1,Rotten,McTeigue's film inhabits a middle ground of being too morose for a crowd-pleaser in the style of Sherlock Holmes yet not dark enough for those wanting a seriously disturbing serial killer pic.
1,Rotten,This latest directorial outing by Ol Parker has a veneer of cancer but it's the wish-fulfilment teenage romance at its heart that is most likely to appeal to its target audience.

0,Fresh,"Although it's not in the same league as Carpenter's other notable remake (his 1982 version of The Thing remains unparalleled), it's well worth reassessment."
0,Fresh,It's a love story stripped of trite narrative conventions and made to feel searingly honest.

1,Rotten,The Grey is superficial existentialism that hopes for the same goodwill that benefited another recent bad-movie-turned-pop-art: Drive.
1,Rotten,The Pornographer does to its theme precisely what pornography does to sex -- it isolates specific parts while ignoring the bigger picture and the larger meaning.
0,Fresh,"Several of the talking heads and reminiscences were part of Jon Brewer's nostalgic documentary Legends of the Canyon: The Origins of West Coast Rock (2010), but Slater's film is slicker, better photographed, and more revealing."
0,Fresh,Somewhere at the bottom of this story is an ache about the value of a life.
1,Rotten,The Last Castle takes [a] timeworn premise and steers it down a ludicrous and obvious path to a conclusion that will have most audience members rolling their eyes in disbelief rather than cheering.
1,Rotten,For those hoping that there may have been a substantial uptick in quality between J.J. Abrams's The Force Awakens and Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi-in much the same way that The Empire Strikes Back improved on Star Wars-you may need a new hope.
0,Fresh,"A big, dumb piece of fun that will do little for your heart or intellect, but will undoubtedly leave you laughing."
0,Fresh,I think this is a great film.
1,Rotten,"Dreamcatcher is unspeakably bad -- and shockingly so -- considering that it's an adaptation of a Stephen King novel, from the director of The Big Chill (Lawrence Kasdan) and the writer of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (William Goldman)."
1,Rotten,"It's a shame to see Charlie Brown, one of our culture's most lovable nonconformists, swing for the big leagues and whiff."
0,Fresh,"Unquestionably the greatest Gerard Butler film (and not the same as a film with Gerard Butler). No, it's the ne + ultraviolence of knucklehead action on which he's cornered the market -one splattering him with brains while showing its own."
0,Fresh,"While it offers some provocative moral quandaries, it serves mostly as a showcase for Patrick Stewart, playing a Juilliard dance teacher whose past has come back to haunt him."
1,Rotten,"Nowhere near as torturous to endure as last year's I, Frankenstein, but it's bland, dull, and forgettable"
0,Fresh,A new movie monster legend is born.

0,Fresh,If you can somehow ignore all this hype... then Rain Man works as a kind of small comedy.
0,Fresh,"The film is not only an account of the moral slippage of one man but the record of a far larger, seemingly uncontrollable escalation."
1,Rotten,"None of the characters have any kind of inner life, and they only exist in relation to Stiller's character."
0,Fresh,"Busy, boundless and brilliantly bonkers, this is the madcap Marxist adventure comedy you need to see right now."
0,Fresh,"Acting and writing are a little uneven, and the three strands sometimes feel contrived, but there's a strong central theme about the mess that people make of their lives and the mess that life can make of people."
0,Fresh,"...actually a bit funnier than the first, but, the Farrelly Brothers never having been arbiters of good taste, you have to wade through a lot of scatological (and racist) dreck to get to the real funny."
1,Rotten,"I don't know if DeLillo's fetishized doubletalk ever works in a visual medium like film, but I can tell you that Robert Pattinson sure as hell isn't up to it, at least not without better direction than this."
1,Rotten,"There are movies willed to life by the passion of their creators, and there are movies like Green Lantern, which are willed to life strictly by market forces."
0,Fresh,"Sudeikis is devilish but sensitive in banter that is not necessarily one-liner jokes, but is always funny. Brie is able to be simultaneously sexual and acutely vulnerable."
0,Fresh,Foster leaves you hoping that Will finds his way home.

1,Rotten,"An overstuffed, head-scratching paranoid thriller with shades of horror and sci-fi thrown in for sometimes confounding measure."
0,Fresh,Director Ron Howard's movie version of the popular Dr. Seuss classic creates a world of wonder and enchantment for kids of all ages. I found myself captivated by everything about it.
1,Rotten,A workaholic roused to life by his contact with an extraordinary person. Music healing all ills. The rehabilitation of an impaired genius. The only reason any of this is barely watchable is because of the stars.
1,Rotten,"Pretensions permeate Hotel, which, as a movie about movies, is the cinematic equivalent of a humor column in The Hollywood Reporter."
0,Fresh,"Though it can be blunt, the beautifully-rendered coloring book animation of The Boy and the World gels so well with its more adult themes that any flaws are largely forgotten."
0,Fresh,"Bouvois doesn't fully indulge the melodrama, using it instead to make subtler points about the fragility of alliances designed to protect moribund value systems."
0,Fresh,"Filipino maven Diaz delivers a bravura, literary human drama that does justice to its great source material."
1,Rotten,Any good spy has to take risks to be successful. Too bad director Dean Parisot and his team didn't employ the same concept.
0,Fresh,"By the end, I'd forgotten how silly the whole thing was, and enjoyed Ruby Sparks as the sweet little modern fable it's aiming to be."
0,Fresh,"So visually beautiful, I didn't even care what I was watching."
1,Rotten,"Un musical soporífero y sangriento que parecía ideal para la macabra imaginación de Tim Burton, pero que resulta una verdadera decepción."
1,Rotten,"...works on some levels - production values are high, especially in the flashback story - but fails on others..."
1,Rotten,"This is a witty little movie, but a kind coda can't erase its withering bite."
0,Fresh,"Unrolling at a frustratingly slow pace, it's the weak link in the series, but it's still an extraordinary -- and extraordinarily well-assembled -- series."
0,Fresh,"A strong cast and some interesting relationships make this a worthwhile entry, although the denouement is lamentably laughable."
0,Fresh,"It's the groundbreaking combination of toe-tapping tunes and wailing pathos, which makes this a truly arresting musical."

0,Fresh,"Takes us into a whole new world and abandons us to our own devices, making for a cinematic experience that is as compelling as it is frustrating."
1,Rotten,"Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman attracted Hollywood talent, had an epic poem and a classic culture clash as their subject and still produced a corpse from it."
0,Fresh,Frankenheimer easily ranks as the pre-eminent director of political intrigue.
1,Rotten,"There are a couple of genuinely funny sight gags, but most of the roadside attractions of Wild Hogs are either boring or outright annoying."

0,Fresh,One of the most lively and up-to-date comedy-romances of the year.

1,Rotten,"Back and forth. Back and forth. There's not much plot for Daniel Radcliffe, so he tip-toes around looking for scares that don't add up."
0,Fresh,My problem with this riches to rags Americana story is that I felt no sympathy for the featured self-absorbed materialists.
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the parts of the movie that are truly good are buried beneath the deadening layers of thriller cliches and an unconvincing love story."

0,Fresh,"He may not be the only daddy to walk the Oscar line, but right now Joaquin Phoenix is ahead of the rest of the pack."
1,Rotten,"The whole concept founders on McConaughey's unalterable cheesiness. Flimsy though it is, the film has a couple of okay jokes, and might have been passable with a more endearing star."

1,Rotten,"Old Fashioned longs to return to the good ol' days, before the scourges of online dating and one-night stands sapped all the sweetness from modern courtship."
0,Fresh,"It's an upbeat, jazzy, cops-and-robbers crime drama with the tone of a romantic comedy and the plot progression of an unfocused documentary."
0,Fresh,"Chase offers a gritty, graceful salute to rock & roll in his ardent, acutely observed debut that makes him, at 67, a filmmaker to watch."
1,Rotten,"Burdened by a cliche-ridden burnt-out-cop movie screenplay and over-the-top performances that don't mesh, this is a thriller that doesn't thrill as much as it irritates."

1,Rotten,"At times, Spectre becomes so comically convoluted, you half expect sharks with lasers on their heads to come swimming out of the underground river."
1,Rotten,Even the most open minded viewer will find it tough to sit through this chore of a horror outing.
1,Rotten,"One can't help but feel disappointed by the totality of the effort; for all its apocalyptic pyrotechnics and high-octane stunts, it fails to muster so much as a single moment to compare with the riveting simplicity of the first film's NOC-stealing scene."
0,Fresh,"To call ""Tomorrow Man"" low key is an understatement, and it's light years from the tone and energy of your usual romantic comedy. We're definitely in indie territory here. Still, a lot of the usual beats are there."
1,Rotten,Not the worst Eddie Murphy movie but certainly not his best either
1,Rotten,An entirely formulaic piece of comedy-melodrama with scarcely a moment of real drama and featuring repartee engaged in by codgers without a genuine dab of wit.
0,Fresh,"Tense, packed with violence, and kicks some serious ass. That is until it falls completely apart halfway through."
0,Fresh,"Themes of dismemberment - physical, emotional, temporal - run throughout this beautifully haunting tale as it effortlessly interweaves the real and the surreal, the spoken and the silent."
0,Fresh,"One of the year's best, thanks to a dynamite performance from Michael Fassbender and an aesthetic and storytelling approach that are boldly, refreshingly unconventional."
1,Rotten,Its most egregious trait is the inability to conjure up laughs over the course of two hours.
0,Fresh,"Instead, it's a fascinating look at how a group of talented, flawed individuals managed to pull together for a while and make some beautiful and lasting films. There's something kind of magical about that, too."
1,Rotten,The term 'wildly uneven' doesn't come close to charting the peaks and valleys of Marci X.
0,Fresh,"Running two-and-a-half engrossing hours, ""Beyond the Hills"" explores the push and pull between the collective and the individual, between faith and free will."
0,Fresh,"It's energetic, colorful, occasionally clever and brims with top-drawer voice talent."
1,Rotten,"Despite flashes of bawdy humor, Can't Hardly Wait is just like its beer: it starts out frothy but soon goes flat."

0,Fresh,The Science of Sleep is a creative effort that is well crafted and visually amusing to watch.
1,Rotten,"Malkovich does such wonderfully unexpected things, especially with his line readings, that he leaves us dumbfounded. No other performer is more effortlessly unnerving than this perversely gifted actor."

1,Rotten,The 1939 Shirley Temple version of this book came closer to capturing Sara's vitality.
0,Fresh,"Spielberg's all about news travelling fast, and to see him direct so jazzily is an unexpected treat. It's the right idea, even if the result doesn't quite feel so."
0,Fresh,"An utter beguilement, tied closely to characters whose motives and feelings are not entirely obvious, even to them."

1,Rotten,"While THE LIGHTHOUSE is full of atmosphere, Robert Eggers fails to fill that atmosphere with a compelling story."
1,Rotten,Asif Kapadia's The Return is a visually sumptuous but emotionally stillborn thriller that may be a bit too modest for its own good.
1,Rotten,Send-off for an uber-bland family franchise that has never really embraced the anarchic spirit of its Toy Story-riffing high-concept.
0,Fresh,"Ready Player One is a two-hour joyful pop culture celebration, a non-stop but not exhausting visual extravaganza that feels fresh and old-school at the same time."
0,Fresh,"... things pick up speed soon enough, toward a wicked twist of an ending, and ""The Bookshop"" becomes the movie equivalent of a page-turner."

0,Fresh,"Although it features the same improv-style hilarity, it feels like a more serious Hollywood satire."
1,Rotten,"When your story relies on snow statues coming to life at convenient moments and acting out arguments that took place 30 years earlier, that's probably a sign that your screenplay could do with another two or three drafts."
1,Rotten,"The problem isn't that it pokes fun at romantic comedies, it's that it itself isn't a terribly good one."
1,Rotten,"A safe, bland, test-marketed product made for tween mass consumption. Like most films arriving with ampersands and colons in the title, it's a bore."
0,Fresh,Attack The Block balances scares with laughs incredibly well and features solid performances from everyone in the cast. Gruesome aliens and a great setting that features outstanding action scenes all make for a very fun ride.
1,Rotten,It is infuriating to watch de Klerk apologists insist that apartheid actually helped blacks.
1,Rotten,"The story simply plugs away without introducing anything new or exciting, and often just repeating with slight variation. It's relatively dull even for a children's caper movie."
1,Rotten,"It's not poor, exactly, and the artwork is jolly good, but the narrative is often incoherent and any youngsters coming fresh to the characters will be, if not mortified, mystified."
1,Rotten,"All this silliness swirls around for about an hour and a half and then you get to leave the theater. Unless you're being held there at gunpoint. And really, that's about the only excuse for being in a theater watching this thing in the first place."
0,Fresh,"Even the uninitiated will be hard-pressed to resist the movie's charms, from its likable leading players and its charming Dublin setting to its wistful take on modern love."
0,Fresh,"Hugo is an intensely personal statement from Scorsese, one not just about magic, but also the magic of cinema."
1,Rotten,Somber and nuanced but prone to self-annotation.
0,Fresh,It's the funniest film of the last year.
1,Rotten,"In the end, Rock the Kasbah isn't so much offensive as it is painfully boring."
1,Rotten,"As straight-laced as its Victorian-era setting, the film lacks gusto."
0,Fresh,The cast's energy is infectious and they frequently seem to be one smirk or snigger shy of corpsing en masse and ruining the take.
1,Rotten,"In the end the picture is done in by its familiarity - anyone who has seen any cop movies or cop TV shows has seen most of ""Sea of Love"" too many times before."
1,Rotten,The buildup here is gripping but the story falters as it grinds to an end.
1,Rotten,Co-writers Coiro and Ritter fill in the schematic script with some juicy lines and amusing situations but never lock on to a consistent tone or thematic throughline.
0,Fresh,A magnificent movie made from the biography of this exemplary lady (Edna Gladney). [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"When it works -- and it doesn't half the time -- it's as if Monty Python were back, putting its merrily imbecilic stamp on the dark world of terrorism."

0,Fresh,This light silly and fluffy satire of the fashion industry targets for a change not the female but male models.
1,Rotten,"Though sweet and occasionally charming, the comedy is innocuous, formulaic and predictable, borrowing elements from Big, Peggy Sue, Back to the Future."
0,Fresh,The perfect Christmas confection.
1,Rotten,A disappointment.
0,Fresh,"Bogart, always brilliant at playing bitter, adds a frightening aspect of fury to Dix, casting his impulses as well beyond his control -- he manages to make cutting a grapefruit seem like an act of vengeance."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, it's hobbled by some thin characterizations, most crucially a romance that just doesn't work."
1,Rotten,The film went on past my interest and continued even when my interest had completely evaporated. And no amount of framing artistry or complex characterization can save a movie once that happens.
0,Fresh,"These women - Ms. Fonda, Ms. Keaton, Ms. Steenburgen and Ms. Bergen, that is - have nothing to prove. Each one brings enough credibility and charisma to ""Book Club"" to render its weaknesses largely irrelevant."
1,Rotten,The only thing more boring than nothing happening is a lot of nothings happening.
1,Rotten,"The greatest failure of the film is its inability to enter into the lives of the Rwandans, Tutsi and Hutu alike."
0,Fresh,Mumford is so carefully visualized in Lawrence Kasdan's new film that you'd sort of like to live there.
1,Rotten,"Just as you're engrossed in one drama, you're whipped across the globe to another, and even with three plots at work, each plods at an excruciatingly slow pace."
1,Rotten,"Top Gun's Best of the Best meet 2001's Hal in Rob Cohen's latest sensorial attack, a derivative action-adventure that's basically an ultra-produced videogame"
0,Fresh,"In this Bush-Ashcroft age, we do not especially need more strictures on civil liberties, but after this despicable film perhaps the great minds of Movieland could be persuaded to agree on a ground rule: films about nuclear terror must not be risible."
0,Fresh,It's easy for a filmmaker to blow up the world -- but what Shyamalan does is much riskier. He tries to blow our minds.
0,Fresh,"The Coens adhere much closer to Portis' novel than the 1969 adaptation did, relishing the era-appropriate  language as if it were their own tongue and imbuing the proceedings with a romantic, ultimately melancholy sense of adventure."
1,Rotten,"...a thoroughly awful, downright insulting piece of work."
1,Rotten,"As an attempt at mad-cap political satire, Dick Clement's Water is really surprisingly wet considering it boasts such useful people in the cast."
0,Fresh,"When Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator arrived in 1985, it set a benchmark in horror-comedy that few films have matched since."
0,Fresh,"This suburban horror tale of a family's disintegration once modern life begins encroaching is reminiscent of such films as ""The Cement Garden""..."

0,Fresh,Reeves's performances is nuanced and offers multi layers of character that we've not ever seen from him.
1,Rotten,"I liked the actors and the tone, I loved the music here, but throughout the film I had a feeling of cinematic dj vu."
0,Fresh,"Let's cut straight to the chase and not mope around the point. ""Logan"" - the final chapter in the saga of the X-Men's Wolverine - is the best superhero-related movie since ""The Dark Knight"" nearly a decade ago."
1,Rotten,"By adhering to coming-of-age formula and relying on plot contrivances, it downplays the internal struggles of its closeted protagonist, and thus reduces the emotional impact."
1,Rotten,"The laziest sort of political cinema, full of straw men and finger-pointing, wrapped up in an awards-friendly bow by its beautiful cinematography and a manipulative world music-y score."

1,Rotten,"Sukiyaki Western Django is Takashi Miike's frantic swirl of a spaghetti western, marrying eastern and western elements in what could be taken as either homage or parody -- or both."
1,Rotten,Film noir on steroids; a movie so cool you're not supposed to be concerned about its total lack of moral grounding. Nor its profound sexism. Nor its misanthropic nihilism.

0,Fresh,"They're still all great fun (even if, with Jim Henson gone and Frank Oz not participating, not everyone sounds quite as they did at the beginning)."
1,Rotten,"At bottom, what we've got here is a movie about a boy who meets a girl, loses her and tries to find a way to get her back. Which returns us to the original question: Can romance be reduced to scientific formula?"
1,Rotten,The subplot about the sleazy movie studio and the kid who plays little Crocodile Dundee are both annoying.

1,Rotten,This movie would have to rise three grades to qualify as a silly knockoff.
0,Fresh,"As a zombie flick, Shaun is more entertaining than most, with chills, a certain quota of the usual gnawed entrails, and a band of survivors fighting off wave after wave of assault from the undead."
1,Rotten,A wasted concept that fails to take advantage of its own originality.

1,Rotten,This movie doesn't contain 'offensive language'. The offensive language contains the movie.
1,Rotten,The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot is lacking in one area that proves to be quite detrimental for a film with such an outlandish title - it's just not fun.
0,Fresh,"It's a slow burn at times, but in the end, it's as satisfying as a good cup of, well, you know what."
1,Rotten,"I just wish they had a better sense of narrative with this one - the gore is effective and voluminous, but the story it serves is reed-thin."

1,Rotten,"The film's initial formulaic competence gives way to outright preposterousness rather quickly, hinging on idiot-plot character motivations, ""It was only a cat!"" jump scares and computer files that may as well be labeled ""Evil Schemes, 2012-2014."""

1,Rotten,"""Ricki and the Flash"" seems like a squandered opportunity for this humane, curious and liberal-minded filmmaker to reflect on some uncomfortable realities. This isn't really rock 'n' roll. It's easy listening."
1,Rotten,"Adrien Brody is trying to use the gravelliest, froggiest voice possible to sound tougher than he looks. Then he takes off his shirt and proves he is no Arnold (he's no Taylor Lautner, either)."

0,Fresh,Surprisingly amiable for all its bleak tidings.
1,Rotten,"Park is sharp, funny and oddly sweet as the dictator but, even with a toned-down assassination sequence, the movie is a throwaway, worthier of a few laughs than it is a full-on international furor."
0,Fresh,Credit is due for key members of the cast -- from veteran actor Kim Yoon Seok to rookie actor Park Yu Chun of boyband JYJ fame -- for carrying the provocative and controversial story well.
1,Rotten,"You take movies like this for what they are and for whom they're intended. But this script, this leaden direction ensures that even as the teen wish-fulfillment fantasy, complete with young women playing dress-up, ""Monte Carlo"" fails."
1,Rotten,"Its best sequences are rather effective, and Shelton's cast brings a lot of good will, but this is also a curiously missed opportunity."
0,Fresh,"This taut thriller is sharply directed by John Dahl and benefits from fine, low-key performances by Walker, Sobieski and Zahn."

0,Fresh,"This is a movie driven by filmmaking, and [Debra] Granik's skill behind the camera drives a lot of the narrative forward. That and, of course, [Harcourt] McKenzie's performance."
0,Fresh,What we - and Tan - come to find is that how the director describes or sees herself in the past doesn't always match up to her collaborators' opinions of the time; this is also a story about the stories we tell ourselves.
0,Fresh,Anarchy unleashed. Never dull.
0,Fresh,"Ozon gives the movie to Ms. Rampling, whose performance is like a perfectly executed piano étude."
1,Rotten,"One's ability to enjoy this film turns on one's capacity to blindly accept implausibilities, coincidences and unlikelihoods that mount as the story presses forward."

0,Fresh,"I will say that THE ILLUSIONIST is a very beautiful movie to watch, with elegant costumes by Ngila Dickson, a sumptuous production design by Ondrej Nekvasil, and gorgeous cinematography by Dick Pope. The score by Philip Glass also adds immensely to one"
1,Rotten,This faith-generic look at belief is spirited and sly but never subversive.
0,Fresh,"A debut film that has enough narrative aplomb, which is perceived through a welcome fluidity and not a little dryness to solve situations that in so many other thrillers tend to stretch artificially and / or confusingly. [Full review in Spanish]"

1,Rotten,You are more likely to be scoffing than biting your nails at this theatrical little effort.
1,Rotten,"This installment is nowhere near the hip, serrated-edge blast of newness the original was in 1996. Suddenly, it's the horror thriller that, like, your parents are excited about."

1,Rotten,"Rock is trying too hard, and Hopkins isn't trying at all."
0,Fresh,The supreme battles are brushed away by the ultimate battles and the ultimate battles are pushed aside by even more absolute battles.
0,Fresh,"That 'Alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of Witherspoon (who is always a joy to watch, even when her material is not first-rate)..."
0,Fresh,"With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages."
1,Rotten,"There are a couple of nicely barbed lines, but this is a film so syrupy on the whole you may want to keep hold of that empty popcorn bucket lest nausea strikes."
0,Fresh,"Sometimes profanely funny, sometimes intensely dramatic, The Big Kahuna is a richly amusing and provocatively insightful film that builds to a profoundly powerful cumulative impact."
0,Fresh,"A feature cartoon that is not at the level of Finding Nemo or Shrek, but is a lot of fun, awfully nice to look at, and filled with energy and smiles."
0,Fresh,"It's a grab bag of comic ideas, but some of the gags are impressively perverse."
0,Fresh,An absolute must-see.
1,Rotten,"Clearly it's designed to be this heart-warming family fantasy, but I kept thinking as I watched it that the material seemed better suited for a horror film."
0,Fresh,"Chad's attempts to negotiate these two worlds (his father's & society's) drive the film along at a rattling pace, even as Gleeson & Fassbender, at the top of their game (in atypical rles), bounce off each other with amiable wit and brooding menace."
0,Fresh,A scene-stealing performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman.
0,Fresh,"While his film's historical accuracy might sometimes be questionable, Bodrov has created a spectacular film filled with all-natural beauty from the realistic locations, one that brings forth the man within the fabled barbarian"
0,Fresh,McCarthy fans will love it!
1,Rotten,These Angry Birds served only to ruffle my own feathers just enough to keep me awake.
0,Fresh,"Dobroshi, a dark-browed beauty, has an arresting stillness - never smiling (except for one brief, unguarded moment with Sokol), never letting down her guard. It's a slice of a life nobody would want, and a portrait that's not easy to forget."
0,Fresh,"[Under the Tuscan Sun] has romance, beautiful people, a magnificent backdrop in Tuscany, Rome and Florence, good characters and a nice arc of hope."
1,Rotten,(F)ireballs and lightning bolts that wouldn't be out of place in an old Ghostbusters flick. There's even a bit of nostalgic charm in that. Then Turteltaub breaks out the dancing brooms and we remember Disney's misguided money grab that got us here.
0,Fresh,"Turner cumulatively generates an intense, enveloping psychic climate that we inhabit physically, and which demands to be experienced in the cinema for its full effect to be felt."
0,Fresh,A scrumptious production of deliciously wicked villains and charmingly noble heroes.
0,Fresh,Profoundly disturbing depiction of the grim realities and the oppression women endure under the Taliban regime - yet enthralling because of Golshifteh Farahani's performance.
1,Rotten,"Zemeckis had a chance to do something truly wonderful. Instead, he slaps together something depressingly mediocre."
0,Fresh,"Excellently shot, with cramped meaning squeezed into every frame, it plays with viewers like only a good film can."
0,Fresh,"Alita: Battle Angel is a special effects marvel that raises the 3D bar. It's a big-budget, popcorn spectacle that certainly delivers the wow factor. If only the plot matched the technical excellence."
0,Fresh,"It's the kind of earnest, no-nonsense monster movie Hollywood used to toss out in the 1950s, and it works for one reason only: The ability of a handful of good actors, and monster movie-loving filmmakers, to keep a straight face."
1,Rotten,"Listening to the music is the only way to get through this movie without tearing your hair out, but still, the meaninglessly retro soundtrack points to the randomness of the picture's choices."
0,Fresh,"Zicherman, who also directed the film, has brought together a strong comedic cast, but he also utilizes them well to create a funny film that even those of us who are not A.C.O.D.s (see: me) can relate to."
0,Fresh,"It's a finely calibrated film, brimming with romance, excitement and humanity."
0,Fresh,"Against considerable odds, this risky-sounding Orson Scott Card adaptation actually works, as director Gavin Hood pulls off the sort of teen-targeted franchise starter Summit was hoping for."
0,Fresh,Igor celebrates a defiantly adolescent and suitably caricatured vision of mortality with the potential to have adults and special young malcontents in stitches.

0,Fresh,It's a thoughtful entry in the growing subgenre of whistle-blower dramas.
0,Fresh,"It's got some future-world smarts that sporadically elevate it above the junk that dominates this genre, and they help carry it through the routine spatter-and-gore moments and sci-fi clichés."
1,Rotten,"We get a film morose and dull, numbing in its body count, and seriously galling in its emphasis on aliens getting shot up with heavy automatic gunfire at close range."
0,Fresh,"Part B-movie sendup, part noirish hybrid of mystery and black comedy, and all original."
0,Fresh,"Miike's direction is visceral, finding the filmmaker not only completely invested in this narrative but also willing to break from his formula at a drop of the hat."
1,Rotten,A thriller that is so generic it can only be dispensed if your doctor checked the 'generic OK' box on the prescription.
1,Rotten,...possibly the worst animated feature ever to be distributed under the Disney banner.
0,Fresh,This is the origins film every fan of the X-Men comics or films wanted and the perfect tonic for those disillusioned by the recent instalments.

1,Rotten,Son of Batman is not Batman and Son. It's a pig wrapped in a silk cape and cowl.
0,Fresh,"Director Todd Haynes steers away from the melodrama that drove Far From Heaven (2002), the emphasis here being on restraint, mood and beautifully nuanced performances, all framed by the type of exacting period recreation that has now become standard."
0,Fresh,"Emerging from the well-chosen clips, Jacobs and Moses seem like opposites, but the film prefers to imply rather than dwell on any great differences. At its absorbing heart are conflicting ideas of how urban life should be organised."

1,Rotten,Hugh Grant just grins and grins as if to explain that he knows the material isn't up to par and he's just along for the ride.
1,Rotten,It's fitting that kaleidoscopic images introduce this psychological thriller in which reality and fantasy collide and splinter into cinematic fragments.
0,Fresh,A longing for home is the central core to Spielberg's powerful dissertation.
0,Fresh,"Experimental filmmaker Lisandro Alonso moves further toward narrative in the gorgeous, elusive Jauja with producer-composer Viggo Mortensen a dream figure at the center of a restlessly unfamiliar, even radical nineteenth-century Argentine Western."
1,Rotten,"While I realize the film isn't aspiring to be anything more than a dumb and/or raucous comedy, there's good/smart dumb and lame/stupid dumb. This effort clearly falls into the latter category."
0,Fresh,"What a shock, it is funny!"
1,Rotten,"And so the film trundles on. A preposterously booming score just serves to emphasise the clichéd script, sound design and cinematography."
1,Rotten,A truly pathetic thriller.
1,Rotten,"Julian Schnabel's stylistic effects can't save this plodding, earnest historical epic that chronicles 50 years of Palestinian struggle through the stories of four different women."

0,Fresh,The genuine classic article!
1,Rotten,"Before adding to the pre-existing heap of critical disdain for Peter Jackson's take on Alice Sebold's much-adored 2002 novel, is it possible to admit the book might have been a tad overrated?"
1,Rotten,"When a biracial couple (America Ferrera and Lance Gross) tell their families about their engagement, everything goes awry in this formulaic flick. One particular low point: A goat at the wedding reception swallows Viagra and runs amok. Ha ha ha!"
0,Fresh,"There's plenty for the director to focus on. Examining the dam's environmental impact alone would take another whole movie. Instead, [director] Yung trains his lens mainly on the cultural impact."

0,Fresh,Loaded to the brim with colorful and interesting characters that burst from the page... this is absolutely a crime thriller that could sustain (and would reward) sequels.
0,Fresh,Felt like one big highlight reel
0,Fresh,"Aiming at a target as easy as suburban sterility, She's Having a Baby might be expected to hit its mark every now and then. But the film's mood is simply too sour, despite the best efforts of a cast filled with appealing actors."
1,Rotten,"it is as predictable as that fifth bite of liver you hate to eat: you know what it's going to taste like, and you know that it's going to suck."
0,Fresh,It is impossible to write a history of modern cinema without mentioning The Wild Bunch.
1,Rotten,More dull calamity than stirring triumph.
0,Fresh,"Although I had to cover my eyes at least a half-dozen times, the movie is altogether gripping, possibly Gordon's best since the '80s."
0,Fresh,"If Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue was about nothing, then Martin Scorsese has made the Seinfeld of documentaries by chronicling it. Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese is at once about nothing and everything."

0,Fresh,"In the arena where budding franchises battle to the death, only The Hunger Games still stands, the young, mangled corpses of non-starters such as The Mortal Instruments and The Host slain at its feet."
0,Fresh,"[10 Cloverfield Lane is] alternately hilarious and terrifying, horrifying and tender."
1,Rotten,"Almost worth sitting through the first half for the revelatory moment when you're forced to ask yourself: Is nearly the entire cast suddenly being attacked by what look like cracked-out ostriches? Why, yes, yes they are."
0,Fresh,"Sophisticated, sarcastic humor and dazzling animation turn a decent plot into visual and comedic merriment"
1,Rotten,"Loquacious, though (the) characters are talking in circles."
1,Rotten,"Doesn't fare very well as a work of cinema, but if you take it as a fictionalised History channel documentary, you might find it compelling."
0,Fresh,"Parallels to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 abound, and Clooney's portrayal of a man offered the opportunity to escape into a world of dreams might be the actor's best work to date."
0,Fresh,"[The] film is not only a clever mystery filled with rich characters, but it packs an emotional wallop like few others in the genre due to its harrowing story of a father desperately trying to find his missing daughter."
0,Fresh,An engaging and inspirational tale... handled with graceful understatement.
0,Fresh,It's fun and it's funny.
1,Rotten,The writer/director behind the exceedingly broad comedy of the Madea franchise approaches the hit 1970s Ntozake Shange play with a pragmatism that succeeds in form but not in function.
1,Rotten,Hardly any shattering revelations here and certainly no blame-placing.

0,Fresh,"Hard-nosed, farcical, tender, critical, satirical, elitist and populist all at once."
0,Fresh,"Westfeldt, now 42, belongs to a generation (and class) of people for whom nothing about having kids is easy. Her intensity feels just right -- better than in any film I've seen in years -- for How We Breed Now."
1,Rotten,"... tone deaf (do students today really say ""hurl chunks"" and ""Too cool for school""?), predictably plotted, filled with drippy love songs that would embarrass Bryan Ferry."
0,Fresh,"Stardust is a little of a throwback to how fantasy movies used to be before the emergence of the multi-part epic serials. It's a lighter, simpler sort of tale."
0,Fresh,as close to genre perfection as one is likely to come
0,Fresh,"How can you not be in awe of the sheer physical achievement, of the intricate choreography of the actors and the camera, of the gung ho performances? When it ends you go, ""Whew!"" It's a triumph of vacuous virtuosity."
1,Rotten,"Overplotted and longwinded, the picture starts strong but steadily wears out its welcome."
0,Fresh,Ingenious and very scary.
1,Rotten,The film consistently settles for the cheapest shock devices and the most shopworn totems of our current neo-gothic moment in the genre.

0,Fresh,"If there is any justice, this year's Academy Award for best foreign-language film will go to The Lives of Others, a movie about a world in which there is no justice."
1,Rotten,Ambiguity takes the bone out of the movie and it collapses.
0,Fresh,"While the first hour slyly builds up the illusions of a man and his wife using the stranger as a catalyst for their weaknesses, in the second half their guilt and lies come home to roost with a shock. It's hard not to leave the film shaken."
1,Rotten,"In The Monuments Men, director George Clooney takes a wild, stranger-than-fiction true story and turns it into a dull, prestigious slog."
0,Fresh,"Clint Eastwood proves once again that no one is able to narrate like him, with characters that are very carnally alive. [Full review in Spanish]"

1,Rotten,"Nodding to the movie's bleak mood, Burton bleakens himself; robbed of the pleasures of the grand, show-offy way he could use his voice, the mischievous twinkle of his eye, you feel cheated."
0,Fresh,Good Trouble shows that Lewis has never lost sight of the principles that are essential to his country's survival and well-being.

0,Fresh,"Absurd but at the same time profound, this is a rare movie find. I have seen it twice and plan to see it again."
1,Rotten,"The movie aspires to be real, groundbreaking, and important in a way that can only recall Will Arnett's Batman in The Lego Movie, a film with more wit, fewer ""it was only a dream"" montages of gloom, and, truth be told, more believable special effects."
0,Fresh,There's nothing wrong with a one-joke horror/comedy -- provided you keep the joke spinning for 90 minutes. This flick (somehow) does.
1,Rotten,It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
1,Rotten,There is nothing here that hasn't been more thoroughly documented in other studies of the drug-related crime that grips Juárez.
0,Fresh,"[I]t's Will Sasso who owns this film. He is the game-winner here. The first third of the film is driven by Sasso and his performance and energy as Baba. Upbeat, happy, fun-loving. He sets the initial tone of the film and draws us into this triumvirate."

0,Fresh,Will Smith and Kevin James keep the whole thing going thanks to the chemistry of their oddball pairing
1,Rotten,"Watching Sarko steamroll his even-more-unctuous rivals has its pleasures, but how can this outrageous creature of raw ambition also be treated in such sobering terms? The Conquest tries to have it both ways."
1,Rotten,"She's a great character, so it's sad that ""The Outrageous Sophie Tucker"" isn't a better movie."
0,Fresh,"The film is NOT for everyone, as it strikes raw nerves. If you can enjoy it for the cinematography, Eastwood's directing and the amazing locations, then you just might enjoy it as much as I did."
1,Rotten,"For about half its length, Jonathan Levine's film The Wackness resembles a grunge remake of The Graduate, updated for the peculiarly specific setting of 1994 New York City."
0,Fresh,"This cleverly orchestrated espionage/war drama (with a patriotic coda befitting its year of production, 1943) is enhanced by subtle touches of humour, all emanating from character, which makes it a triple joy as a classic from Billy Wilder"
0,Fresh,"Rock often struggles in comedies he didn't have a hand in writing, but he looks comfortable trading sentimental confessions with Sandler, who channels some of the same paternal sadness he so gently played in Meyerowitz."

0,Fresh,"Unlike a lot of institutional raunch in today's comedy, Humpday finds laughs out of what is rarely made explicit between buddies."
0,Fresh,"A miraculous blend of grief and humor. Big, bold, brash, then sneakily meta. I am only starting to get my head around the emotional and creative right-hook of it. A fitting end (for now) to the MCU."
0,Fresh,"I predict this raucously funny, deliciously irreverent comedy will outdraw, outperform and outlast the competition this summer. The ogre rules!"
0,Fresh,The action doesn't quite conjure up the claustrophobic intensity you expect but the father-son-storyline is sufficiently muscular.
0,Fresh,"This may be bereft of the bombast that Americans expect from their spy adventures, but as a modern spin on a John Le Carr-style thriller, it's a stylish and smart action film."

0,Fresh,Intelligent and heartwarming screenplay.
1,Rotten,"The audience has layers of plot twists to sift through, with no great reward at the end for the investment."
0,Fresh,"Let's hope that this wasn't just a one-off for the comedian, but something tells me that he has much more to say."
0,Fresh,"The LEGO Batman Movie uses its lead character's flaws in a way that is sometimes to its own detriment, but regardless of the film's underwhelming nature, it's still entertaining enough to enjoy."
0,Fresh,"As an unfolding event, Snatch is fun to watch, even if no reasonable person could hope to understand the plot in one viewing."
0,Fresh,"The documentary is rescued only by a final sequence in which Chaikin restages the famous 1958 group photo A Great Day in Harlem, this time with mostly women."
0,Fresh,"Once you realise that the human characters aren't the focus of the film, you can sit back and admire everything else."
1,Rotten,"The tagline reads, 'Where her book ended, the real story began.' The condescension only gets worse when you watch the actual film."
0,Fresh,"Found takes its film-buff inspiration from the likes of early De Palma, Argento or Cronenberg. They are hard acts to follow, but Schirmer knows his stuff. Found is a singularly sick, sad story and announces the filmmaker as a notable talent."
0,Fresh,"This is a film made as if it was created and put together in the 1950's, and that aesthetic eschews the rapid fire patterns and short attention span platitudes of many modern films."
0,Fresh,"A vital musical ramble, showing us where some of soul's founders landed after their moment of pop glory."
0,Fresh,"It's fun. Magic Mike XXL moves along at a brisk clip, leaning into all the absurdities of its premise and giggling all the way. It's the cinematic equivalent of an afternoon spent drinking beer on the beach. Everyone's having a good time."
0,Fresh,"Hittman paints with a delicate brush, and gets a strong performance out of newcomer Dickinson, who gives Frankie a soft soul beneath his chiseled physique."
0,Fresh,None of the interviewees in Marina Zenovich's fascinating documentary manages to make sense of the famous filmmaker's behavior or apparent thinking. But they all have compelling impressions.
1,Rotten,"The debut from writer-director John Hindman features a premise that sounds an awful lot like As Good As It Gets, except the script isn't as sharp."
1,Rotten,Weitz is lucky Tomlin signed on; her prickly performances distracts us from the symphony of false notes in the script.

0,Fresh,"There's room for Charlie Brown in the imaginations of a new generation completely unfamiliar with his embarrassing dilemmas and resilient efforts to dust himself off, haters like Lucy be damned. Charlie Brown is the Dirt Off Your Shoulder OG."
0,Fresh,"More psychological than horrifying, with an intense DiCaprio and Scorsese channeling Hitchcock and Serling."
1,Rotten,Sharon still maintains she never knew her 'V' was being photographed in the original Basic Instinct. 'I figured the hair and makeup team between my legs was just a perk.'
0,Fresh,The movie has enough jokes that land and enough emotion behind it all to make it an absolutely acceptable sequel to the 2012 hit.

0,Fresh,"Barrymore never shies away from Josie's awkwardness, which only make her portrayal that much more winning."
0,Fresh,"The film has so many clichs, well-trodden plot points, precious characters and heavy-handed sentiment that I almost can't believe I'm recommending it, but here we are."
0,Fresh,"It's a shame the script is so lazy about plugging gaps in logic that pepper the plot. Of course, these lapses are there because [Leigh] Whannell is working so diligently to manipulate us."
1,Rotten,"Sadly, the answers that emerge from this crisis fail to give any satisfying literal explanation to the film's central metaphor - and the metaphor itself seems misplaced."
0,Fresh,"Despite some flaws, it's worth seeing this well-executed, well-acted Swedish murder mystery, which broke box office records; you're not likely to face such a tough, outrageous (anti)heroine in any American film"
1,Rotten,"At the end, the crowd applauded to signify their ironic appreciation for the imperishable pleasures of trash culture. Unfortunately, with Snakes on a Plane, there isn't much of a joke to be in on."
0,Fresh,"I suspect Hitchcock would enjoy watching this slow-churning thriller, which pilfers a few of the master's storytelling tricks as it revels in its own dark heart."
0,Fresh,"That doesn't make this adaptation necessary, but I will say that having a majority Black voice cast in the movie was really awesome to hear. Yes, even Beyoncé."
0,Fresh,"Though the 3-D effects are awesome, this movie also succeeds in two-dimensions because it is driven by the story and not by effects."
0,Fresh,"""The Night Comes for Us"" is nothing short of the best action movie of the year, the best action movie in years to be honest. An epic crime saga, a mean-spirited banger, and a story of betrayal and redemption."
0,Fresh,"Although arguably not on par with some of the later Hepburn/Tracy pairings, Woman of the Year is still a precious lark ahead of its time, and reveals the co-stars in the early days of their formidable on-screen chemistry."
1,Rotten,A well-crafted yarn that overstays its welcome.
0,Fresh,"Like the characters populating it, this film leaves us with a sense that something is missing, but it's still smart, compelling, offbeat, and worth seeing."
0,Fresh,"Laces its copious gross-out gags, pothead humor and female nudity with the smartest social satire this side of The Daily Show."
1,Rotten,"Run, Fatboy, Run winds up being as immature and exhausting as its protagonist."
0,Fresh,"Redford's fiercely committed and quite brilliant performance is the reason to see this daringly minimalist, slightly overlong curio."

1,Rotten,Director Raja Gosnell actually makes this film work far better than one might expect it to work.
0,Fresh,"Wholly absorbing and inspired in parts, this carefully crafted curio dares to suggest that Murnau made a Faustian pact with an actual vampire to play the title role in exchange for the neck of the film's leading lady at production's end."
0,Fresh,"It doesn't offer much in terms of optimism, but provides an eye-opening glimpse into a frequently overlooked social issue."
0,Fresh,"Absorbing and satisfying, just like a good old-fashioned page-turner of a novel."
1,Rotten,"However artsy it may be, a movie that jerks the audience along from beginning to end is not a good one."
0,Fresh,"The Force Awakens steers the franchise back to its popcorn origins. It's not a Bible; it's a bantamweight blast. And that's just as it should be: a good movie, nothing more."
0,Fresh,"[A] near-perfect romantic comedy, and the elegance with which it's been constructed is a beautiful thing to behold."
0,Fresh,A masterful performance by Pacino.
0,Fresh,"An uneven, at times absorbing portrait of four couples struggling to define their relationships."
1,Rotten,"Stone's direction is measured, methodical, and totally lacking in the fire and flamboyance that sometimes electrified and sometimes ruined his earlier films. The story moves along without any real sense of urgency or suspense."
0,Fresh,It was a pretty fair movie (save for the weird zooming camera work that's become a trend-your movie feels dated five minutes after release).
1,Rotten,Overblown.
0,Fresh,"If Trainwreck frosts its cake with a you-have-to-laugh-or-you-would-be-crying-all-the-time icing, you can still taste that sadness in nearly every bite."
0,Fresh,"The two main points Persepolis makes are that strife is relative, and all politics are personal."
1,Rotten,"This surfing documentary plays like a more intimate, folksy companion piece to its superior predecessor, Step into Liquid."
0,Fresh,"Flawed though it may be, this is a story that delivers when it counts."
1,Rotten,"...an affable, sporadically entertaining piece of work that's ultimately undone by its emphasis on relentlessly silly elements..."
0,Fresh,"Graham pulls off a nimble hat-trick, fusing throwback, unapologetic queerness (frank sexuality; a world of tricks, one-night stands, and no moralizing about any of it) and unbridled romanticism."
1,Rotten,"Maher may see demented dogma all around him, but what's the basis of his own moral compass? We're not religulous, just curious."
1,Rotten,"Twilight Saga: Eclipse is by far the best of the bestselling Stephenie Meyer novels-turned-movie. Keep in mind, West Nile Virus is similarly the ""best"" mosquito-borne illness and Portland, Oregon is the ""best"" city to be homeless."
1,Rotten,Enjoyable but ultimately mystifying.
1,Rotten,Most of the period hallmarks of the British New Wave are paraded here.

0,Fresh,Derailed offers its share of sexy seduction and shocking violence.
0,Fresh,One of the finest screwball comedies ever.
1,Rotten,"Eccentric even by Roeg standards, this goes overboard with the histrionics, and even the slight supernatural tinge that defines Roeg's films is clumsily handled here. Yet there are some thought-provoking ideas and exchanges, and the acting is impeccable."
1,Rotten,"The actors give the whole thing a sense of genial goodwill, but that's not exactly what you want out of a movie about two craven murderers."
0,Fresh,Outstanding performances by Rachel Weisz and Tom Wilkinson are upstaged by an Oscar (R)-quality appearance by Timothy Spall as the hateful Holocaust denier in this film based on a 2000 defamation lawsuit.
0,Fresh,"No, it's not the tightest spoof movie around, but you'll laugh a lot."
1,Rotten,"An almost-committed-incest! alarm nearly jolts proceedings into a movie weirdly watch-able for the wrong reason. But that story's vying with a handful of others--family grief, father-son estrangement, hometown return, courtroom showdown--for top billing."
1,Rotten,These are not characters most people can sympathy with. One tends to watch dispassionately as the inevitable plays out.

0,Fresh,Surely the most lyrical work of cinema to feature an AMC Pacer.
0,Fresh,"Filled with a compassionate, profound and intelligent narrative that never leaves you for a second, Shoplifters is the best film of the year and a perfect swan song to Kirin Kiki who literally gets buried in a Kore-eda household."

0,Fresh,"Premonition has its merits, as a film about the need to love one's spouse today, for you never know what tomorrow will bring."
0,Fresh,"A fine film could have been built around [Denzel Washington], but Dan Gilroy's screenplay veers off in 10 directions at once after a promising start, and tells its story clumsily."
1,Rotten,"Solid but uninspired, Harry lacks brio."
1,Rotten,"Rumors of the slasher genre's death have not been greatly exaggerated, if this Chrysler Million Dollar Film Contest winner is any indication."
1,Rotten,"I'm sure there was more to the astounding life of Ian Dury, but this picture doesn't submit the nuances, only the juiciest clichs imaginable."
0,Fresh,Ends up asking the younger side of the franchise's two-tiered audience to be the introspective ones this time. How often do you see that?
0,Fresh,"...even though the majority of the jokes fail completely, the movie still manages to be entertaining enough to be considered an inoffensive time-waster..."
1,Rotten,"If I can say anything for the film, it's that it delivers exactly what the legions of Twi-hards want and expect--or what 'Team Edward' wants, anyway."
0,Fresh,"Fortunately, Prinze and Cook offer up a good deal of adolescent charm, and they have a curious chemistry together."
0,Fresh,"A major triumph for the Dogme group, and a success from any point of view."
1,Rotten,"It takes the film a deadly long time to kick in, and when it does, it largely retreads formula: ironic use of pop standards, musical numbers with contemporary choreography played for maximum laughs, risque one-liners."
0,Fresh,"Aside from a handful of fight scenes (only one of which evokes any serious eye-rolling), the Wachowskis actually seem to have given serious effort to telling a story"
0,Fresh,"Crimson Peak gets under your skin and crawls away with abandon. It leaves you alarmed, unsettled and in a giddy state of cringe-in-your-seat squirm."

0,Fresh,"It is confidently dumb, defiantly moronic and a fine way to spend 90 minutes of time before doing something of value."
1,Rotten,"It's an intriguing combination in theory, but the individual elements both feel a little half-baked, and stirring them up into one doesn't help."
0,Fresh,"It's assured and unflinching, but without Powley's childlike, otherworldly quality and her offbeat beauty, the story wouldn't have worked as well as it does."
1,Rotten,"For all the horrors Heli reveals about modern-day Mexico, it's stubbornly lacking in insight about the characters that live there."
0,Fresh,Are there two other actors who are able to utter the word 'motherf**ker' with such forceful comic authority? I think not.
1,Rotten,"If Petroni wanted to leave viewers with a mixed interpretation, he succeeded."
0,Fresh,"Devoted family man, aspiring poet and petty whiner, the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels depicted in Lutz Hachmeister's unusual documentary presents a compelling study of the banality of evil."
1,Rotten,"In the end, one wonders exactly what Raval wants to say here except that the challenges of growing old in America are not confined to one sexual orientation or another."
0,Fresh,A film bursting with pleasures great and small ...
1,Rotten,A fascist snuff film.
1,Rotten,"While there are some acceptable action sequences, it's the screenplay -- complicated by some less than inspired performances -- that dooms Warcraft at every point along the way."
0,Fresh,The most satisfying Bond movie in a very long time.
1,Rotten,"A Long Way from Home often feels tired and over-familiar, only occasionally sparking into life when Joseph and Suzanne find time away from their suffocating other halves."
0,Fresh,"...if nothing else, the film is worth checking out for the sight of Arnold Schwarzenegger playing a fiddle."
1,Rotten,As well done as the set pieces are... they can't hide how little the characters have been developed.
1,Rotten,A film almost entirely devoid of personality.
1,Rotten,"Say this for Cassie Sullivan (Chlo Grace Moretz): no matter how bad things get during the alien-wrought apocalypse, her hair looks great."
0,Fresh,"Horror films with a message are rare. Well told, well acted, wet ones, are even rarer. Youâ(TM)d have to be crazy not to watch The Signal."
0,Fresh,"You can't take it seriously, but the movie is as lively as it is debased."
1,Rotten,"Push has an interesting premise, but it just doesn't manage to translate it into a great movie."
0,Fresh,The film is an intriguing thriller that asks questions likely to have a powerful effect on conscripts in the current war on terror.

1,Rotten,"The novels are a film franchise waiting to happen. Judging by this film, though, I'd say they'll have to wait a little longer."
0,Fresh,...the overabundance of periphery characters and their respective subplots winds up hurting the film more than anything else.
0,Fresh,"This movie deserves to be seen -- and learned from. It captures the moments in which each of us stares out across an emptiness, searching for a connection that will keep us from falling."
0,Fresh,"It's a rental, rather than a visit to the cinema."
1,Rotten,"Well, at least someone is trying to emulate the Farrelly brothers -- except ""Knucklehead,"" director Michael W. Watkins' half-assed, halfhearted attempt to copy the Farrellys' out-there style is missing both their jackassical riffs and their heart."
0,Fresh,"The roster of crowd-pleasing elements seems dubiously calculated and ambitiously lengthy, but ultimately, that's no strike against the film, which follows Iron Man's lead in obscuring the calculation behind outsized, gleeful fun."
0,Fresh,"""Song to Song"" reminds a viewer of what latter-day Malick does best ... place pretty Caucasian chalk outlines within a filmic world of such paralyzing beauty that we're prompted to appreciate the reality into which we stagger once the film is over."

0,Fresh,"Terrific, fun."
1,Rotten,"No better than cable-quality, and devoted fans really deserve something beyond assembly-line stuff when their TV idols are brought to the big screen."

0,Fresh,"The movie wobbles as it approaches the home stretch, but, thanks to its leading man, manages to stick the landing."
1,Rotten,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes has some life to it as an action film, but every time anyone opens their mouth, man or beast, you'll feel like someone figured out a way to sneak in groundbreaking CGI into your middle schooler's class play."

0,Fresh,"If I had to make a comparison, I'd say it is an unlikely pairing of Green Street Hooligans and Sideways."
0,Fresh,Whets our appetite for when [more] of Wilson's plays receive this deserved treatment as a great playwright...to indelibly commit such rich characters to multidimensional life
0,Fresh,"All that Hoene must do is stage his action well (he does), nail the comedic beats (gets it mostly right) and generally bring enough freshness to the endeavour so that detractors don't bleat ""It's not as good as Shaun of the Dead"" (which it is)."
0,Fresh,"This isn't SyFy Thor, it's HOLLYWOOD Thor! Crummy costume and set design is made up by being full of heart and soul."
0,Fresh,"An eminently airworthy sequel to one of the studio's most renowned creations, 1953's Peter Pan."
0,Fresh,"If we're laughing at the movie: there's something very gratifying about the regularity with which Harlin cuts his cheesy characters down to size. And as a piece of cinematic engineering, it's nothing if not efficient."
0,Fresh,"The dialogue isn't exactly sparkling. It's matter-of-fact at best, cliched at worst, but Tara and friends are easy to like. The ballet movie tradition is well served."
0,Fresh,"To his credit, West eschews the gore and mayhem of most modern horror movies in favour of slow-building atmospheric menace."
0,Fresh,"Mixes likeable personalities, inventive photography and cutting, and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating, silly, perverse, hopeful and always fun."

0,Fresh,"Four years after Entourage concluded its hugely enjoyable eight-year run on HBO, the characters make a winning return for this feature-length movie."
0,Fresh,"Never afraid to sink her teeth into a role, Davis crafts a tough-as-nails exterior for Veronica, snarling insults at the other women while trying to mask the creeping sense of dread that continues to mount as the deadline draws near."
0,Fresh,"A fast, frantic, and sometimes funny sex comedy not unlike a thousand other sex comedies."
1,Rotten,"For a privileged few, ""The Art of Self-Defense"" might be a brilliantly dry dark comedy. For the rest, it's a tragedy, a nightmarish horror flick about the ruthless panopticon prison of gender. We don't all get to choose how we take it in."
0,Fresh,Distinctly disquieting as well as gratingly funny.
0,Fresh,"If you're someone that values good acting, oddball humor, decent makeup effects, odd plot points, good score, and far off twists, ""The Dead Don't Die"" is well worth seeing."
1,Rotten,"Devoid of any thrills and excitement, it's doubtful that even the core younger audience will be engaged enough to sit through this one."
0,Fresh,"Wasikowska gives it her all, and Cohen shines, but while this is a better film than the first, that was a low bar to reach."

0,Fresh,Ruba Nadda's 2012 Toronto International Film Festival Gala Presentation is an okay actioner of the political mystery intrigue type.
0,Fresh,"Despite a few good moments, it's depressing, obnoxious, and condescending. To use a favorite critics' word, it's ""leaden""... it just refuses to move."

0,Fresh,This exhilarating mix of biting dark comedy and taut crime drama showcases some terrific performances and a sharp-tongued script packed with incisive sociopolitical subtext.
1,Rotten,Harlin's version at least had cheap thrills -- Schrader's has none.
1,Rotten,"Strange is pretty much the same sort of movie we've seen from Marvel Studios ever since Robert Downey Jr. snarked his way through the first Iron Man and into our hearts all those years ago, and the same style of origin Marvel has been delivering since."
0,Fresh,Alfonso Cuaron delivers his best film since Children of Men.
1,Rotten,"All that flash serves to prop up what's in essence a one-act play, constructed around a political message that's telegraphed from the start."
0,Fresh,"The creepiness here comes not just from the head-chomping, but also from the way young women are treated in this tiny, medieval village."
1,Rotten,"Aims to be bittersweet and lighthearted, but its frothy side and unfocused narrative have misplaced the necessary depth needed for the story to take full flight. Sunshine Cleaning misses the mark, not because of what is there, but what isn't."
1,Rotten,"How fitting that director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) would choose a vampire flick as his latest project - the man has a career that, despite the horror he continually inflicts on innocent moviegoers, simply will not die."
1,Rotten,The actors' serious faces are out of place in this hopelessly silly action conspiracy.
0,Fresh,There is a richness and a subtle sadness to the core relationship between Anna and Elsa.
0,Fresh,That the pacing is glacial hardly matters - at least for the first hour or so - because Larry Smith's cinematography is so breathtaking.
0,Fresh,"Fortunately, all of the meta humor is a sweetness that keeps the film from becoming a post-modern mess."
1,Rotten,Perhaps it is time for the Wachowskis to stop trying to recreate The Matrix.
1,Rotten,"Pacific Rim Uprising is a dumbed-down version of its predecessor, an imitation of the first film that doesn't live up to its creative imagination."
1,Rotten,"Truth and guilt and responsibility are not just themes here, they are topics of debate and we keep returning to the seminar and the courtroom to hear those debates."
0,Fresh,"Too bad there's no Oscar given out for ""Best Voiced By Character."" Liam Neeson as the Tree Monster would win the 2016 honor, hands -- or limbs -- down."

0,Fresh,Even those who have never touched the little plastic blocks should find it unexpectedly enjoyable.
1,Rotten,"""Dilili in Paris"" is instead an awkward misfire, the more regrettably so for showcasing a kind, smart and brave mixed-race girl from New Caledonia as its young protagonist."

0,Fresh,"In overtaking a legend, this True Grit earns its spurs."
0,Fresh,"The blend of action, romance and political plotting is handled with smooth efficiency by director Neil Burger and Tris is an appealing, if ever so slightly dull heroine."
1,Rotten,"The corker-to-groaner ratio heavily favors the latter as the bagel-and-dreidel jokes begin to lose their spark, as does the story."
1,Rotten,"A fairly generic turn-of-the-'90s action film...judged as a sequel to RoboCop, it's irrelevant and ridiculously trivial."
1,Rotten,[Winter's Tale] looks nice and goes down easy-and with a few hearty laughs for more cynical viewers-but has little narrative substance or emotional sustenance.
0,Fresh,"It's smart about evil, especially about the way it tends to radiate."

0,Fresh,For the birds.
1,Rotten,The performances are overdramatized and unbelievable in a script that suffers from the same weaknesses.
1,Rotten,"Inevitably, the film seems as hollow and pointless as David is."
0,Fresh,"Somehow, Johnny is fascinating to watch. I hate this guy, but I'm captivated."
0,Fresh,"Tarantino crams enough movie-loving passion into the film to keep you not just entertained but occasionally riveted. Above all else, it's a really enjoyable ride."
1,Rotten,"essentially a futuristic Night of the Living Dead without the social commentary, pacing, or interesting characters"
0,Fresh,"A serviceable Imax 3D nature documentary that duly meets the requirements of the form: majestic and intimate outdoor imagery, a grave yet reassuring lesson on the importance of wildlife preservation, and a short-and-sweet 40-minute running time."
1,Rotten,Packed with clichs.
0,Fresh,John Irvin's Miramaxy paean to Irish Ceili music gets by on infectious geniality.
1,Rotten,The novelization of the screenplay probably would make a pretty decent bedtime story.
1,Rotten,Woefully unfunny.
1,Rotten,"The comedy is hit and miss, with good bits interrupted by dead patches."
1,Rotten,"One of John Wayne's last films (he died in 1979) is also one of his weakest, a tired and tiresome Western for which he is way too old."
1,Rotten,"The sordid sagas on display here are by and large a feeble bunch, further hampered by atrocious continuity errors that suggest Rodriguez and Miller didn't even have any recollections of making a Sin City flick before this one."
0,Fresh,Polina is mesmerizing.
0,Fresh,"It's both nostalgic and fresh, a tender homage to, especially, the initial Star Wars (""Episode IV: A New Hope""), as well as a bridge to help those of us stuck in the splendor of Hoth edge into the future."
1,Rotten,"Freddy can never really die, even if Hollywood beats him like a dead horse."
0,Fresh,The To Do List is cheerfully unconcerned with realism; the cast is so obviously over high school age it almost becomes part of the joke.

0,Fresh,"In the end, like too many other recent thrillers, it is a triumph of matter over mind, but at least it holds your interest while you are watching it."
0,Fresh,"It's not that Delpy and Hawke don't have the chemistry, they're terrific together, but their overemphatic ways feel false in a film that's endeavoring for realism."
1,Rotten,Falls squarely into the near miss category.
0,Fresh,All-time sci-fi classic.
1,Rotten,"It's full of up-with-people messages, liberal ideals and progressive viewpoints -- all good stuff. But such stances need to be organically woven into the fabric of the piece or you end up with a heavy-handed, preachy screed. You end up with Tomorrowland."
1,Rotten,Content to skate on the pre-existing audience's fondness for these characters and the Star Trek brand.
0,Fresh,"The visual textures of the Frozen world remain sumptuous, from the jewel-toned forest to the foamy ocean waves that Elsa confronts in a breathtaking sequence."
1,Rotten,"Taking 50 minutes to get to the present where the original took five, here we are offered something resembling justification for why poor little Mikey beat and stabbed his way to infamy."
0,Fresh,"It's another of the film's ironies that while Gaines owes his success to an ability to make a room feel empty, Whitaker, even at his most still and silent, fills the frame with life -- with presence."
0,Fresh,An uneven yarn of pregnant pauses punctuated by charm.
0,Fresh,Pratt and Lawrence are great company. They could make 90 years go by in the blink of an eye.
0,Fresh,"Armageddon -- slick, overblown and formulaic to its core -- nevertheless amounts to this season's closest screen equivalent to an apocalyptic thrill ride."
0,Fresh,"The movie, modeled after old-fashioned Westerns and Joseph Campbell's writings about mythology, also has a sweet innocence."
1,Rotten,"A botched adventure that looks suspiciously like any number of other sci-fi tales you will have seen, and pales instantly by the comparison."
0,Fresh,"Murray has been singing songs to us ever since his old days on Saturday Night Live, but never like this."
0,Fresh,"A plucky, whimsical romance as the ugly-duckling fantasy morphs into a satiric take on celebrity culture."

0,Fresh,"Peoples has an eye for the details of the Jones family's life, scraping by on her wits while trying to touch the upper class life the pageant represents."
1,Rotten,Stage Fright strikes a balance between its song-and-dance theatrics and the grisly business of those same kids being slaughtered by a masked killer. The songs are fine; the slaughter is sub-standard.
1,Rotten,"Overall, the rambling ""Jayne Mansfield's Car"" is almost as big a wreck as its namesake."
0,Fresh,"Watchable cop thriller with strong performances and suitably gritty direction, but the climax gets bogged down in some embarrassingly awful cliches."
0,Fresh,"This story is about tenderness and empathy, including Carbee's for his plastic proxies."
1,Rotten,"Whether it's really watchable depends on what you feel about the charmless Kaye, whose vehicle this is from start to finish."
0,Fresh,"The movie is driven by the characters' passionate, despairing arguments about the fine line between victimization and violence. But Paradise Now also has, at times, an almost surreal visual flair."
0,Fresh,Wonderfully profane.
1,Rotten,It's Fellini in Vegas.
1,Rotten,River stabs all-too-wildly in the dark.
0,Fresh,"While certainly not for all viewers, and even if it takes a bit to gain viewer engagement and traction, the film turns out to be, pardon the obligatory pun, fairly bloody fun."
0,Fresh,If there is to be yet another X-Men movie in the future - though I have to say that now might be the time to call it quits - then a solo effort with Fassbender's super-nasty Magneto would be the way to go.
0,Fresh,"The film is a funny, moving and heartbreaking exploration of a young man struggling to grow past his grief that features phenomenal performances from Davidson and Burr."
1,Rotten,"The picture's biggest sin (or biggest achievement) is the fact that it manages to be stunningly short yet still have several flat, boring stretches."
1,Rotten,"Realist in tone, the film lacks much imagination and trundles along too predictably for comfort."
1,Rotten,"Metropolis is a sentimental mess; it is staggering; yes, but it has the blind staggers; and they lead to nothing but the sentimental repentance (capital and labor shaking hands!) of the morning after."
0,Fresh,Only for Blade fans.
0,Fresh,Wisecracking and fourth wall-breaking as ever.
0,Fresh,"Space Cowboys is at least three different movies--high-tech thriller, low-key comedy, rumination on aging--jammed together into an implausible but very likable entertainment."
1,Rotten,"Even when the complicated political and legal machinations are handled gracefully, Recount doesn't have time to give these people depth or render their unique situations with sufficient shadings of complexity."
0,Fresh,Destined to be the year's most talked-about arthouse phenomenon.
1,Rotten,"Director Kenny Ortega shows little feel for the material. The three leading ladies, encumbered by layers of latex, huge wigs and voluminous costumes, are rarely allowed to cut loose."
0,Fresh,The movie is a muted elegy to emotional waste.
0,Fresh,"Departures is about life, death, grief and loss, but it's also, in a quietly effective way, about coming to terms with expectations."
0,Fresh,"The Spy Who Loved Me represents a new found energy for the franchise that was struggling for definition in the new decade. With amazing stunts and iconic moments, it's hard not to love this film."

0,Fresh,One thing is certain: Danny DeVito's production company Jersey Films is turning into a major industry force.
0,Fresh,"It's not flashy or showy and it is not going to knock your socks off, but it's a small jewel of a film: gentle, languorous, humane, and acted with the utmost sweetness."
0,Fresh,"The latest Purge is an erratic, fairly absorbing and righteously angry prequel."
1,Rotten,"An incomprehensible cacophony of screams, shock cuts, dour pseudo-philosophizing, heavy metal mutilation and low-rent TV-standard performances."
0,Fresh,"Borrowing from Hitchcock (Shadow of a Doubt) and Kubrick (The Shining), Ruben's elegant, darkly humorous tale deconstructs patriarchy and can't be divorced from the Republican family values that dominated the 1980 with their 1950s retro feel."
1,Rotten,It's not Eastwood's finest hour.
0,Fresh,"Some of the musical's superfans will feel shortchanged by the movie no matter what, but you have to give credit where it's due. The adaptation is pretty faithful to the original - for better and worse."
0,Fresh,"It's strictly a fun B-movie horror, on the order of Tremors, that somehow got released by a major studio."
0,Fresh,"It's an action film concerned with speaking and thinking, rather than shouting and exploding; each time the bomb goes off, it becomes less exciting, less of a focal point, until the most striking pyrotechnics on show are of the mental and emotional sort."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the characters feel more like symbols than people, despite strong performances, including what might be Portman's finest work to date."
1,Rotten,"Think the Addams family, only less appealing."

0,Fresh,"Se puede ver simple y sencillamente para pasar el rato, con una buena bolsa de palomitas y un refresco al lado."
1,Rotten,There's not even any biting satire on social mores or anything else. The laughs are as broad as the scenery is picturesque. The characters are types but the whole experience is agreeable enough.
0,Fresh,"If there ever was a film that needed to be experienced in order to be appreciated, this is it. Reading critics' words about it just does not do it justice."

0,Fresh,"Much more epic, entertaining and fun than could have been anticipated. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,A beautifully told story driven by heart and an ensemble of young actors who embody the characters with truth and authenticity as they face triumph and tragedy together ... lensing is intimate yet energetic and fluid immersing us in these young lives.
0,Fresh,"[I]t features a piece of hurtin' that is likely something you always wanted to see but never knew it - a moment that singlehandedly shows up 'Pacific Rim' as the visually incoherent, failed volley for badassery it was."
0,Fresh,Writer/director Nick Whitfield is clearly a talent to watch.
0,Fresh,A moving morality play indicting America for its ongoing love affair with the Second Amendment.
1,Rotten,"This one's so laughless, so charmless, and so resoundingly amateurish that one wonders why it doesn't carry a ""National Lampoon Presents"" in front of the title."
0,Fresh,Marx Bros.' big hit may miss with today's kids.
0,Fresh,"A beautiful-looking film, very poignant and moving, showing Ford to be a real filmmaker and not some flash in the pan trying his hand at a new medium."
0,Fresh,"The term ""revisionist"" gets thrown around a lot in film criticism, especially when it comes to genres like the Western, but in the case of The Sisters Brothers, the description certainly applies."
1,Rotten,"That ancillary characters are played by big-name supporting actors, each of whom seems to be working in a different register, just underscores the choppy nature of the story."
0,Fresh,"This two-ton prestige pic won't win the hearts of highbrow critics or those averse to door-slamming, plate-smashing, top-of-the-lungs histrionics, but as a faithful filmed record of Letts' play, one could have scarcely hoped for better."
1,Rotten,"Boring and unoriginal, this new version might have some fancy visuals and a loud soundtrack but they're just a smokescreen for how boring and lifeless the film is."
1,Rotten,A train wreck. And this one is so bad I couldn't wait to look away.
0,Fresh,"Though the movie encounters some of the usual pitfalls of time-travel plots (predictability, muddled rules) and sports some hokey, eighties-style special effects, what it offers in terms of diversity and messaging is a treasure."
1,Rotten,Whatever happened to minimalism?
0,Fresh,It's refreshing to see an animated film that isn't striving to appease only children or for a merchandising deal.
1,Rotten,"Scenes come and go in clouds of confusion, flashbacks and cutaways leaping in and out of the action like misbehaving children, but a moral stink persists."
0,Fresh,Conveys the challenges and difficulties faced by all who dare to make the world a better place.
1,Rotten,"If Hill keeps signing on for half-hearted romps into the realm of idiocy like The Sitter and 21 Jump Street, he's going to get shoved aside by whatever chubby comic wunderkind is lurking behind him."
0,Fresh,"Like du Pont himself, Foxcatcher draws us in without really allowing us to get under its skin."
1,Rotten,"The heroes get involved in the strange rituals of the cult of Stirba. Although the rituals, like the rest of the movie, are impenetrable and amazingly inept, I have to concede that no one presides over a ritual quite as well as Sybil Danning."
0,Fresh,Fascinating but imperfect.
0,Fresh,"Just when you think you've seen it all-I never really think so, but sometimes it can feel that way-along comes something completely new, or at least something so intriguingly bizarre as to seem completely new."
0,Fresh,"Returning to the comically tragic tone that made his much hailed 2002 debut, Love Liza so noteworthy, Louiso manages to create a memorable showcase for undervalued character actress Melanie Lynskey."

0,Fresh,"Law Abiding Citizen isn't going to win any honors for the most coherent, logical plot ever written."
1,Rotten,"Simply crashes upon takeoff, going nowhere in a hurry, sniffing around for pop culture overkill and domestic depression insight it never makes a genuine play to explore."
0,Fresh,"He's Just Not That Into You stands as an amusing yet potent reminder than when we live for ourselves instead of others, everyone loses."
0,Fresh,"Instead of just tickling your tear ducts, the vindictive physicality of conversion therapy coupled with Edgerton and Hedges' confidence and resolve throws a sucker punch that leaves an aftertaste of necessity, rather than sentimentality."
0,Fresh,"Writer director Carlos Cuarón (brother of Alfonso) has created characters that are so real you can almost hear their thoughts. Tato and Beto are filled with contradictions, faults, quirks and foibles, yet we like them and want them to succeed"
0,Fresh,To dismiss it as merely conventional would be wrongheaded; it's a deeply felt and nuanced drama fueled by subtle acts of empathy.
0,Fresh,"Bob Byington's imaginative indie comedy recalls some of Richard Lester's 60s films in its freewheeling narrative structure and cartoonish sight gags, though the humor is more often peculiar than laugh-out-loud funny."

1,Rotten,"It's hard to imagine a big-budget film worse than Avengers Age of Ultron or even Gods of Egypt - there, it's been said - but Batman vs Superman has the dubious distinction of showing utter contempt for its audience and wearing that contempt on its sleeve."

0,Fresh,Admirable and moving.
1,Rotten,"A Lifetime movie, - the commercials, but with every predictable twist and turn and treacly message intact. She shoots. It bores."
0,Fresh,It's an adept genre exercise with rare primal depths.
1,Rotten,"So confused in its approach and its message, that it actually reaches the point where I wonder if it is a satire of satires."

1,Rotten,"This film seems to imply that non-existence is preferable to existence. Some people feel that way, but I wish they would keep it to themselves and not inflict this on others through this kind of media."
1,Rotten,"""A melodrama about numbness and detachment, writer-director Gregg Araki's adaptation of Laura Kasischke's novel is a paradox on paper and an anesthetized dud on screen."""
1,Rotten,[A] professionally executed yet bloodless film ... an act of homage that hews reverently to its source material while missing the essential spirit and vitality that once powered it.
1,Rotten,"Translating its accessible premise too cleanly, Grand Seduction neglects the rough edges of character, the very details that make a place and its people memorable to a visitor. They're also what convince a person to stay."

0,Fresh,It is worth the time and money if you're looking for something a little different and edgy.
0,Fresh,"Made in 1969, ""The Honeymoon Killers"" presaged elements of David Lynch's filmic approach, and clearly informed John McNaughton's similarly-themed stomach-churner film ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer."" Romantic dysfunction never looked so banal, brutal"

1,Rotten,Stinkier than a visit to the local tip
0,Fresh,"Shame received an NC-17 rating because of its racy imagery, but the real maturity on display in the film is the bare bones depiction of human behavior."

0,Fresh,"The writer, Shen Jian, and the director, Jing Chen, have made no concessions to the non-Chinese viewer in their compressed, chaotic narrative."
0,Fresh,"The film is so well paced that it's an honest to goodness multiple viewer. In fact, it had more appeal to me on a second viewing, mainly because I missed some sneaky stuff the first time around."
1,Rotten,"At a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is, Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture."
1,Rotten,"There is just about enough to entertain, but Stern's paint-by-numbers approach does little to celebrate Jobs' most famous injunction to ""Think Different""."
1,Rotten,"Just once I'd like to see a Star Wars film and be wowed by seeing something completely new and fresh. I didn't hate it, however it commits the crime of being underwhelming and unoriginal."

0,Fresh,The rampaging reptile is back to remind us that monsters have meaning.
0,Fresh,"The jokes in the movie are just as dumb as the ones in the trailer, but what doesn't come across in a two-minute preview is just how many there are. It's an avalanche of dirty puns, and what it lacks in ingenuity it makes up for, almost, in sheer volume."

1,Rotten,"The movie itself plays more like a corporate recruitment video - or an extended episode of ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" - than a deep, discerning dive into an American success story."

0,Fresh,A low-key and intelligent character study.
1,Rotten,"With a bafflingly awful performance from McAdams and insulting, manipulative twists, Passion never capitalizes on its style and instead wallows in unintentional camp."

1,Rotten,"I know Kar Wai's got a fanbase, but to me he's equivalent to a recent film school graduate using all of the post-production tricks that he's learned, either to show off what he's learned or to cover up his lack of talent."

0,Fresh,"Director Jack Henry Robbins crams an eighties aesthetic into his magnificent feature debut that blasts apart families, nostalgia, capitalism, art, and just about everything else that can be tarnished with the brush of absurd kookiness."
0,Fresh,"It constitutes a bizarre blend of the incredibly smart and the very, very stupid, laden with ridiculous in-jokes that somehow coalesce into a clever (if simple-minded) comedy."
1,Rotten,"I was fed up of them all by the end, I have to say."
1,Rotten,"... a desperate-to-please amalgam that combines the hoariest clichés of both the western and science fiction thriller ... The action sequences range from ""They went that-a-way"" humdrum to, when spears prove the equal of alien blasters, downright idiotic."

0,Fresh,"Achieves suitably swift momentum, the twists and turns coming fast enough to keep one distracted from the obvious, telegraphed denouement lying in wait."
1,Rotten,"Imagine an Elmore Leonard movie scripted by a bad Nora Ephron imitator, and you'll have an idea of how dead-in-the-Jersey-water it is."

1,Rotten,"a derivative and wooden religious horror flick, timed somewhat distastefully to take advantage of the Easter holiday"
0,Fresh,"The special effects are amazing, and the long takes and measured pace give War the flavor of an old-school impossible-mission epic, but there's something sociopathic about the way the film portrays the eradication of humanity as heroic."

0,Fresh,"Phantasm: Ravager is not the place to start with the series (noobs beware), but it's a helluva way to end it."
1,Rotten,"As viewers of this dreck, we could teach the earth's crust a few things about being deeply bored."
1,Rotten,"At this point, the most we can hope for now is an animated film that doesn't concern breaking out of a zoo of some sort."
0,Fresh,"Patience pays off in this immensely satisfying, rapturously urgent thriller-romance. Fernando Meirelles breaks from traditional trappings for one of the year's best movies."

1,Rotten,"At this stage of the game, it's getting a little hard to present Dundee as a naif from the outback in the big city."
1,Rotten,"A police thriller with few police and fewer thrills, Crown Vic nevertheless offers a few rewards for the patient viewer, though these come wrapped in a derivative package."
0,Fresh,"Bad Neighbours 2 is a legitimately funny comedy with a story, the minor miracle of modern filmmaking. It flirts with social commentary, takes advantage of most of its ensemble, and at least vaguely attempts to sequel-proof itself."
0,Fresh,"One of the funniest, best written movies of the year."
1,Rotten,"If Apatow had any deeper message, it ends up getting drowned in this mess, but that's bound to happen when you try to take a premise that might barely support 80 minutes and stretch it well past its breaking point."

0,Fresh,"The hook consistently gives the whole film a most welcome dose of knowingly cheeky and absurdist humor, lending a most distinctive personality to the more conventional genre formula."

0,Fresh,A very stylish mystery and supernatural thriller with a dream cast.
0,Fresh,"In a summer where the Rocky-on-a-horse rip-off Seabiscuit is winning acclaim just for simply not being a sequel, here is a story that actually says something."
1,Rotten,"A preposterously overblown take on the drug trade, Savages is occasionally fun but mostly just plain dumb."

1,Rotten,"Acker does himself no favors with rote anti-dogmatism and vapid characterizations. Despite that, though, his little creations remain oddly compelling."
1,Rotten,"The Revolution will not be televised, Gil Scott-Heron once sang. Nor should it be filmed, we might add -- at least not as a costume drama with stirring speeches, an inspirational love story and gloriously heroic military charges."

0,Fresh,A solidly crafted reworking of the familiar story with solid performances by Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson and excellent attention to detail by director John Lee Hancock.

1,Rotten,"In these 96 minutes of stilted dialogue and a plot that needlessly loops back on itself, you will find The Transporter Refueled dutifully following the rules and predictabilities of the action genre and not much else."
1,Rotten,The problems lie not with the actors but with a glib approach that exposes the flaws of the original story.
1,Rotten,"This first feature by 27-year-old American director Brady Corbet combines a fine Euro cast, grandiose art direction and a thundering score by Scott Walker, but the result is an embarrassing hodgepodge that's very hard to follow."
0,Fresh,"This is Angelina Jolie's movie all the way, and she does not disappoint."

1,Rotten,"With Little Old New York re-created by William Sandfell, Newsies often looks wonderful, and Bale and the boys give it heart and excitement. Yet as a musical, Newsies rarely hits home."
1,Rotten,What could have been a really exceptional movie on the great fight for water and a horrifying portrait on lives lived in isolation just kind of limps along to its finish with all the conviction of a dismissive shrug.

1,Rotten,"Authority figures acting like destructive, temperamental children? These days, it just feels too close to home."
0,Fresh,"As a throwback to the politically conscious, paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, The Whistleblower does a good job of mixing muckraking social commentary and suspense, while avoiding the typical missteps of the genre."
0,Fresh,"Eddie The Eagle is a crowd-pleasing triumph about one of Britain's lesser-known Olympic heroes, and the dream he wouldn't let die."
0,Fresh,"12 Strong is a thinking-person's war story, one in which deductive and clever reasoning wins the day as often as who has the most bullets and air support. This is something quite different couched in a familiar cloak, and the results are impressive."
0,Fresh,"If Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is not the best haunted house movie ever made, it is certainly among the most intricately constructed."
1,Rotten,A storyline that unimaginatively rehashes countless pivotal elements from other stalker-themed movies means that the whole production is a dull and pointless exercise that twists and turns in precisely the manner you expect it to.
1,Rotten,Director Stephen Daldry and screenwriter David Hare exhibit a continued inability to thrillingly translate literary forms to the screen.
0,Fresh,"The heart of the movie beats like a drum, and got me in step from the start."
0,Fresh,"At times, it's like three episodes of NYPD Blue jammed together and whittled down to feature length."
1,Rotten,This is merely garden variety misogyny masquerading as some bastardized form of empowerment. Someone give Lauren Lapkus the funds and support to make her own movie.
1,Rotten,"We are continuously at the mercy of the reverential, underscored by ever-billowing crescendos of voluminous orchestrations. Someone want to turn the treacle down?"
0,Fresh,"Takes its time to get going, but once the action kicks in, it's mildly engaging with lots of mindless fun, especially for avid fans of martial arts films."
1,Rotten,"Like a wasted appointment at a bad psychic's reading room. All the set dressing is there, but it leaves you with an empty, unsatisfied feeling inside."
0,Fresh,It's an emotional roller coaster full of wonder and sorrow that feels like Cuarón rediscovering distant memories from his own childhood.
0,Fresh,The funniest film of the year.
0,Fresh,"Colorful, vibrant, exotic, The Living Daylights more than delivers an eyeful of entertainment. At a running length just over two hours, the most thrill- seeking Bond fans will get their money`s worth."
0,Fresh,"Pulpy, self-consciously subversive, above-average summer entertainment ..."
0,Fresh,"While it's not quite BRAZIL, THE DOUBLE feels like Ayoade- sooner rather than later- just may have what it takes to create something on that level."
1,Rotten,... a maze of naive politics and gruesome brutality. It's no more about Franco's Spain than a can of Franco-American spaghetti is about Italian food.
0,Fresh,"Apted, himself now in his early 70s, says he hopes to continue the series further. Long may it live."
1,Rotten,"What the film really seems to be is an invitation to thoughtlessness, a cultivation of the irrationally wilful."
0,Fresh,Kingdom of the Tiger is a completely engrossing Big Movie and a cure for those suffering from fear of the docudrama form.
0,Fresh,"Unlike many ""lost"" treasures, Wake in Fright lives up to its nightmarish reputation."
0,Fresh,"It's classic horror, plain and simple, meant to unsettle and unnerve."
1,Rotten,"Really nice on the eyes, but this will make your brain hurt. I don't think repeated viewings will clarify anything, either."
0,Fresh,John lives in a frisky otherworld of willful incoherence all its own.
1,Rotten,"Evil Dead suffers the curse of its own mediocrity: while it is really not bad, it would linger longer in the viewer's mind if it were better - or indeed worse. As it is, the fun ride is over and forgotten as soon as its brisk 90 minutes have elapsed."
1,Rotten,"Most regrettably, War squanders the considerable merits of its leads."
1,Rotten,"If there is a theme in this film, I would venture to guess that it's right there in the title. The soldier, el soldado, has his day and his way throughout."
0,Fresh,"See the movie for Whitaker alone: He's possessed by evil and possesses it wholly, rendering the film (and everyone in it) his plaything."
1,Rotten,"Scherfig often doesn't seem to understand what kind of film she's making, resulting in a broad first half and a slow-motion creep-fest in the latter."
0,Fresh,"There's a streak of darkly funny absurdity running through the film as well, not least in the climactic in-the-street showdown, which finds John Travolta's wooden-leg-toting marshal caught awkwardly in the middle when the bullets start to fly."
1,Rotten,Oliver Schmitz's film... does not clarify what he wants to be. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, it's this streak of realism that prevents Sex And The City from becoming just another fluffy New York fairytale."
0,Fresh,Jason Bourne is a perfectly fine movie. (Especially this summer.) But it's hard to get past the fact there's no real reason for this movie to exist.
1,Rotten,"Want to take your kids to a movie that equates junk food and fun? If so, then this one's for you."
0,Fresh,It's no masterpiece--I can admit--but the performances won me over in the end...
0,Fresh,"An exquisitely crafted drama of seduction, survival and sexual awakening."
1,Rotten,"This may be the first movie that would have been better off if it had cast actor Brian Baker, the Verizon Wireless 'Can you hear me now?' guy, as its young lead."
0,Fresh,"The son of an Egyptian immigrant, the Minnesota born Selim demonstrates a startling intimacy and empathy for his characters, but infuses his story with a candid tough love for their weaknesses."
0,Fresh,"While the follow-ups became increasingly puerile as the series went on, the original film produced its fair share of belly laughs."
1,Rotten,grim to the point of tedium
0,Fresh,"As the sunny days pass and Bridget finds herself sinking into the job of caring for Frances more than she imagined, the warmth trickles into the corners of the film leaving cynicism no place to lurk."
1,Rotten,Jon Amiel's portrait of Darwin's efforts to accept and acclimate to a new reality is mucked up by all manner of directorial flim-flam.
1,Rotten,"Stone makes the mistake of heightening the already over-the-top phenomenon of pro football. It's a shame, because inside Stone's overly aggressive style and inflated running time, a good two-hour movie is struggling to breathe free."
0,Fresh,The Drop doesn't just offer James Gandolfini's last screen performance. It reminds us character-driven mob movies still matter.
1,Rotten,Movies like this are why the Coens are uneven
1,Rotten,...it all seems a bit silly when things easily could have been avoided simply by moving out.
0,Fresh,"Ayers's warmest film to date finds meaning and depth in its ""I love you, man"" exchanges and rarely goes too long without staging some daring detective work and videogame ultraviolence."
0,Fresh,"Verhoeven has pulled off a feat many auteurs seek but few accomplish: He's made a film that is both utterly accessible and wholly personal, sensationalistic enough for his die-hard fans and prestigious enough for the Lives of Others crowd."
1,Rotten,How come these bad guys have such bad aim? Does everybody in real life say something funny after they kill a person? Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
0,Fresh,"Relying on a bevy of circumstantial evidence and without proving much in the way of anything, Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer nonetheless homes in on a provocative and highly plausible thesis."
1,Rotten,"Rowan Atkinson does as much as he can with a so-so script. There's a scattergun approach to humour, with gags of varying length and quality tumbling around. But in the right frame of mind, with small children, it almost works."
0,Fresh,"Things Change is like the careful telling of a sly and spirited joke. Everything builds slowly, and the telling is as important as the punch line."
1,Rotten,Something's Gotta Give is exactly the kind of 'adult' dreck that you'd expect to see on Broadway.
1,Rotten,"In Bay's world, which is more about metal than people, every action sequence must be edited like a cinematic seizure and every extreme-telephoto image must be jammed headlong into the next."
1,Rotten,"Though it's intended as a follow-up to UNBREAKABLE, this one has earned the title 'Unbearable' - deserving of the coveted, rarely awarded distinction of Zero Stars."
0,Fresh,This film is a pro-Clinton one.
0,Fresh,"A comeback story like [The Current War: Director's Cut] might surprise you, but considering the players involved, the end result shouldn't come as a shock."
0,Fresh,"In Free Fire, bullets and one-liners and shreds of emotion zip by-snatching you up, wringing you out, and letting you go, exhausted and exhilarated."
0,Fresh,A minor comeback for Nora Ephron...Ferrell and Kidman make the most of the formulaic plot...
1,Rotten,Mr. Lelouch seems to have indulged Ms. Kaas and Mr. Irons beyond any rational narrative consideration.
1,Rotten,"However, the further the extremes to which he pushes his material, the more [director Peter] Berg loses his grip on the picture, and he allows it to fizzle out in a gross, ill-advised epilogue."
0,Fresh,"The cast are more likely to attend rehab than the Oscars ... but despite my scathing preconceptions, American Reunion is actually pretty funny."
1,Rotten,"Scherfig demonstrated her ability to infuse a talky script with plenty of wordless mood in An Education. But in One Day, the words - many of them taken directly from the book - are never convincing."
1,Rotten,"I confess to be unfamiliar with the vagaries of illicit foreign-goods transport, but I have to think it's more exciting than the rote action that unfolds in this movie."
0,Fresh,A gritty science-fiction film that features a population of humanoid crustacean-alien creatures [that] is far more grounded in reality than any of the current rom-coms currently unspooling in your neighbourhood multiplex.
0,Fresh,"If, at over two hours, it is an undeniably onerous watch, that is by design: Finkiel's film certainly understands the taxing nature of sorrow."
0,Fresh,"All good war films ought to be antiwar films at heart, and Flags succeeds in this regard, as a necessary civics lesson -- and a testament to the rebuking of the power of propaganda."
0,Fresh,HD seems to have reawakened in Romero a sense of mischief.
0,Fresh,[T]he specifics of the setting (particularly Georgia's intense homophobia and lack of economic prosperity) along with the visual poetry of the dancing (Gelbakhiani is a real-life dancer) gives unique expression to a familiar tale.
0,Fresh,"Not nearly as much of a mind-bender as Memento, yet The Lookout is, nonetheless, a praiseworthy homage to that inscrutable brain teaser."
0,Fresh,"Backed by a soundtrack of hip-hop and edited to within an inch of its life, Kennedy's film has sleek gutter charm to spare."
0,Fresh,"She Done Him Wrong is played straight, and to the hilt, and as a result it is good fun."
0,Fresh,Captures a master filmmaker at the height of his powers - and the quirks that drove him...a fascinating character study and a wonderfully entertaining inside show-biz story.
0,Fresh,"Whisky Galore! is an enjoyable film with comedic elements while maintaining a very serious tone throughout most of it, which ends up adding to the rather dry comedy and fun of it."
0,Fresh,"Clearly inspired by 1960s Batmania, the hunka hunka burning camp that is Barbarella adapted French science-fiction comic books into gleefully oversexed cinematic pop art. [Blu-ray]"
0,Fresh,"Ninety-+ years on, the movie is just as funny and endearing as it was in 1931."
1,Rotten,"The direction on Johnson Family Vacation is numbingly slack; the synapses between the scenes don't spark effortlessly, as they should, and the whole enterprise feels dragged-down and belabored."
1,Rotten,"To call out any remake as specifically ""unnecessary"" is a dash down a rabbit hole, but the mere existence of a 2011 cover of 'Straw Dogs' is, all things considered, befuddling."
0,Fresh,"Without Russell Crowe's dynamism holding it all together, Gladiator might have devolved into a rash of overblown pandering."
0,Fresh,"One of Bergman's undisputed masterpieces is a seminal work of psychonalayis and metacinema, raising more complex questions about identity and role-playing than it could possibly answer, thus deliberately encouraging ambivalence and ambiguity."
1,Rotten,Just desolately average.
0,Fresh,"An enticing and complex statement on the different prisons (religion, sport, Arirangmarriage) we trap ourselves in to protect the status quo."
0,Fresh,"Works more than it doesn't, though it's easy to conclude that the film exploits some of the elderly in the movie."
0,Fresh,Ten years of Marvel movies all culminate in  Avengers: Infinity War. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no.
0,Fresh,"'A fresh-faced, big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies, with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand.'"
0,Fresh,"Rothe is an incredibly empathetic performer, and watching her grapple with some heavy life choices pulls you even closer to her."
0,Fresh,Thoughtful essay.
1,Rotten,"Every Day plays it rather safe and sanitised, with no sex or edge, and no real desire to probe the potential complexities of its strangely creepy scenario."
0,Fresh,"In showing us understanding with how to cope with the greatest loss, and how the human connection can continue, the filmmakers behind A Monster Calls have shown us one thing more than any other: the truth."
0,Fresh,"Watts and Penn are first rate as a married couple divided by their desperation to do right, while stylistically it's top notch."
0,Fresh,"It's certainly Johnson's all-time funniest performance. But it offers the same old Hart, who mugs throughout the movie, even when he's theoretically playing the straight man."
0,Fresh,The Mind's Eye is really fun to watch.
1,Rotten,Perhaps the scariest thing about Joshua was the feeling I got at the end that I had just sat through some kind of weird gay panic movie.
0,Fresh,"It's not a satisfying whole, but parts are sheer delight."
1,Rotten,"The Dead Don't Die mostly settles for broad, glib political commentary."
1,Rotten,An utter redundancy...
0,Fresh,Haunting.
0,Fresh,As rambunctiously entertaining as it is crude.
0,Fresh,"We already knew this was going to be a thrilling epic, but I had no idea of the emotional punch it would pack."
0,Fresh,"Pacino's drug-crazed, bloodshot performance gives this gangster movie a terrifying edge."
0,Fresh,A searing Iranian film about divisiveness as a toxin in relationships.
0,Fresh,You just have to marvel at how well Jonze and screenwriter Charles Kaufman keep the whole thing from strangling on its own eccentricity.
0,Fresh,"Fast-paced, relentless, and almost too hyperactive for its own good, it stands as a perfect example of a filmmaker making a genre his own."
1,Rotten,Dorothy's return doesn't give you much of a return for the time invested.
1,Rotten,"By the end, even Schwarzenegger looks worn out. Maybe being governor wasn't such a hard job after all."
0,Fresh,Jessica Chastain is a perfect match for Aaron Sorkin.
0,Fresh,"Fire effects, a volcanic eruption, battles, thrilling adventures on land and water, crowds of actors make a kaleidoscope of action that lasts for more than two hours, and the incidents follow in a succession so rapid as to be sometimes a little confusing."
1,Rotten,"Every time the film cuts to Martin Freeman as Bilbo, the nominal central character now stuck on the sidelines with next to nothing to do, it's clear how wrong all this has gone."
1,Rotten,"There's little in this pointless rehash to distract audiences from the pleasure of watching Tamblyn, a fine young actress whose direct, grownup stare belies her baby features."
0,Fresh,Daniela Vega is a delight.
1,Rotten,"The new Dawn of the Dead moves along with speed and slick visual style, but it's soulless and anonymous as -- well, a shopping mall."
1,Rotten,Rings embodies a common problem of attempted franchise revivals: indecision about its intentions.
1,Rotten,A movie that wants to be daring but winds up feeling prefabricated.
0,Fresh,"The moral is not too original, but the offbeat characters certainly are."
1,Rotten,"I felt it moved along a little too quickly, as if a tour guide with a pressing dinner reservation was determined to make all the appointed stops, but didn't linger long enough to let the impact soak in."
0,Fresh,Bridge of Spies has a brassy and justified confidence in its own narrative flair.
1,Rotten,"I'm not sure why the producers even bothered to dramatize the story if they weren't going to keep tight on the details, but I suppose there are greater mysteries in play here. Top of that list: What happened to Connecticut?"
1,Rotten,"This is the kind of do-nothing movie you eventually quit watching on an airplane. Unfortunately, theaters don't supply SkyMall catalogues to take up the slack."
0,Fresh,"The effort and teamwork highlighted in this film is absorbing, intelligent and it remarks how exciting investigative journalism is, perhaps it lacks adrenaline, but its cinematic importance is undeniable. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,The most hilarious movie I've seen this year.
1,Rotten,"One gets the sense that Wim Wenders, whether of his own volition or at the urging of others, is perpetually walking on eggshells, only tossing the pope the type of softball questions that he can effortlessly knock out of the park."
0,Fresh,A very moving tribute to an underappreciated hero who spent his life as a tireless defender of the defenseless.
0,Fresh,This is a film of philosophical rumination as its hopeful characters find themselves living in an imperfect world of their own creation.
0,Fresh,An excellent combination of comedy and excitement.
1,Rotten,"This new Shrek film is overburdened with a ""been there, done that"" feeling."
1,Rotten,"A stately backstage drama that gradually morphs into a full-blown supernatural horror movie, [this is] a synthetic experience that sporadically intrigues but never fully engages."
1,Rotten,At certain points you'd be forgiven for thinking that you're watching a soft-core flick.
1,Rotten,"The filmmakers make a big show of striving for sincerity and substance, but they so load the dice that their movie is heavy-going from start to finish."
0,Fresh,"A rollicking, profound testament, not only to the quality of Franklin's performance, which the recording already gave us, but to the intangibles that are better seen than heard."
0,Fresh,"It was educational. Great performances... There was just something lacking in the emotional impact of it, which is odd."
0,Fresh,"Short, sweet, tight, to-the-point and able to fully satisfy anyone craving a silly disaster film."
0,Fresh,"It does fruitful work in the field of sport, where lofty notions of excellence and heroism can believably grapple with brutish realities involving money and ego."
0,Fresh,"Its plot developments are safe and predictable, but the things Post Grad does well suggest it could have been more than just another middling romantic comedy."
0,Fresh,"Though sometimes over-keen to sacrifice logic for a tricksy payoff, the rebooted The Invisible Man is a triumph of low-fi invention elevated by a crackerjack Elisabeth Moss performance."
0,Fresh,"Ashes of Time remains less an example of early Asia Extreme than one of Asia Extremely Confusing. But Wong's strength has always been his use of screen sensuality, and this colorful revision ups the expressionism to dizzying heights."
0,Fresh,Ice Age is wonderful.
0,Fresh,It's a thriller sobering enough in its graphic portrayal of forced violence against women that it would be tough to watch if not for the controlled fury Weisz brings to her performance as a down-to-earth avenging angel.
0,Fresh,A touching look at ballet's battle-hardened youngsters.
0,Fresh,"A clever and original thriller with a fantastic performance from it's lead, but it never fully lived up to it's potential for me."
0,Fresh,Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. are eminently watchable.
1,Rotten,A much more conventional film with fewer pretensions to high art. Violence exploited for mere entertainment is so commonplace it hardly seems worth noting.
0,Fresh,"Landau's performance here is a deftly calibrated thing of beauty, and it ranks among his finest work since his Oscar-winning turn as a frail Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood."""
0,Fresh,"The entire cast is worthy of praise and, in Davis' case, beyond it: Her downcast eyes speak volumes."
1,Rotten,"John Cassavetes made some iffy movies during his career, but none is worse than the original Gloria."
1,Rotten,"A clueless, pointless, unfunny dud. The kind of movie where one can tell that the actors already know they're making a piece of crap."
1,Rotten,To put it simply: this film's best jokes are in the trailer.
1,Rotten,The ultimate downfall of the series is that it steadfastly refuses to define its own rules.
0,Fresh,You may find yourself a dedicated follower of Maggie in the end. I know I am.
0,Fresh,"The stranger-than-fiction cast of characters is fascinating, and their high-stakes machinations are nothing short of mind-boggling."
1,Rotten,"The script is a mixed bag of elaborate and unnecessary pseudo-politics, intriguing ideas and mostly confusing rehashed romantic mishmash."
0,Fresh,"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist made me want to be a gay teenage boy. That's a first for me, and I watch a lot of Bravo."
0,Fresh,"Aniston does the heavy lifting, carrying Mother's Day on her sturdy shoulders whether with slapstick, superbly paced comic repartee or anxiously dealing with the very real threat of another woman horning in on her relationship with her sons."
1,Rotten,[Chan's] action choreography is toned down and lacks its usual comic flair.
1,Rotten,Goyer flounders around like an indecisive movie buff indulging in every special effects-laden trick in the Directing 101 handbook.
0,Fresh,"The other reason ""Starbuck"" succeeds as a movie is that it goes more for the heart than for the big laughs."
0,Fresh,"The acting is good for the most part, though the second film (like most sequels) pushes plot aside in favor of spectacle. Hellbound is gorier, larger, and more accessible than the first."
1,Rotten,gleefully nutty chaos!
0,Fresh,"A quietly compelling portrait of the human side of Jesus, wrestling with his doubts while wandering through the Judean desert."
1,Rotten,"Early scenes show clearly how NWA's music emerged from the war zone of south central LA in the 1980s. Thereafter, Straight Outta Compton comes straight out of the school of biopic cliché."
0,Fresh,The one facet that separates Paranoid Park from the director's previous work is the way Van Sant uses all the talents in his arsenal to create something that few films have ever attempted to portray: the manic assemblage of teenage life.
0,Fresh,"Audacious, slightly predictable, semi-disgusting, ultimately not-so-crazy."
1,Rotten,"Too much game, not enough heart."
0,Fresh,Please fasten your seat belts -- you're in for quite a flight.
1,Rotten,"While the movie's not quite accomplished enough to leave us breathlessly awaiting the next chapter (as did the last Hunger Games flick), it also doesn't leave us wanting to avoid the sequel at all costs."
1,Rotten,"The ripping outer-space fights are the main attraction, and they're mostly entertaining, though not in a way that will make you feel good about yourself."
1,Rotten,"The book is better----Long awaited screen adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's ""Shipping News"" fails to transport the goods"
1,Rotten,"Jefferson has nowhere to go but up -- and eventually he gets there (note the title) -- but, boy, does the getting there take its sweet time."
1,Rotten,"The film is filled with hilariously bad performances, expository dialogue and production values that suggest it could have been a low-budget film-school project."
0,Fresh,"Cute little flick, and it has absolutely nothing to do with daisies."
0,Fresh,"Many have compared Maggie's Plan to earlier works by Woody Allen, though I was reminded more of the output of Noah Baumbach -- at any rate, either comparison works."
0,Fresh,Jagger the actor is someone you want to see again.
0,Fresh,Gone Girl is easily one of the best thrillers to come out of Hollywood in years.
0,Fresh,"The third film about Marvel's superhero based on the Norse god of thunder shakes things up drastically, taking the series in a more colorful, more fantastic and more comedic direction."
0,Fresh,"Rebirth is essentially a platform for discussion and listening, linking the audience and the subjects through a symbiotic relationship of understanding."
0,Fresh,One of Ozon's finest efforts to date and one of 2019's must-see releases.
0,Fresh,"False sentimentality can be a danger. However, The Leisure Seeker is dry-eyed even at its most moving and a celebration of love even as it reaches its end."
0,Fresh,"A stunning demonstration of moral and existential suspense in relation to duration, much like Agnes Varda's 1961 Cleo From 5 to 7."
0,Fresh,Disturbia slowly builds from suspense to shocks at the cost of very few brain cells.
0,Fresh,"In Four Lions, five complete morons keystone kop their way toward terrorism and their 72 virgins..."
1,Rotten,Earnest to the point of blandness.
0,Fresh,"It's nice to have things we can rely on in this unpredictable life, and among the most reliable of all are Tyler Perry movies."
0,Fresh,"Logan has penned an engaging script, and he and Grandage have assembled a luminous cast."
0,Fresh,"It's depressing material, but Temple's universal warmth and appeal -- as well as Dwan's skill -- make it work."
0,Fresh,"A rambling, unruly salute to the transformative power of the imagination that is filled with visual inventiveness, wilful eccentricity and even a burst or two of Pythonesque humour."
0,Fresh,Booksmart manages to be the funniest high school comedy in years while never losing sight of its powerful emotional core.
0,Fresh,While it's an improvement over the standard McCarthy vehicle -- at least she plays a character rather than a caricature -- this latest is too long and too predictable to fully work.
0,Fresh,"All in all, this long-delayed sequel is a very mixed bag, with just enough laughter and tears to squeak by as holiday entertainment."
1,Rotten,"Divines is at the same time overflowing, a typical case of an all-that-matters-to-me first feature, and dull, packed with clichs aimed at a mainstream teenage audience."
0,Fresh,Refreshingly and unabashedly sincere in its embrace of Western conventions and archetypes.
0,Fresh,"What Ferrara, Depardieu, and co-writer Christ Zois have created is a character who can't distinguish between sex and rape-a monster who knows he's a monster, but not why."
0,Fresh,"But even with the missed opportunities for big drama, Denial mostly works, telling a real life tale that many people (myself included) lived through without ever knowing about it."
1,Rotten,The story doesn't seem to have been scripted as much as scooped up and patched together with the weakest glue on the market.
1,Rotten,"Despite taking a full-on approach to the issue of alcoholism, filmmaker Ponsoldt undermines his own case by telling a story about the problem itself rather than the people caught up in it."
1,Rotten,"In the end, it's all a narrative contrivance to link one technically slick, shallow action sequence to the next, with Craig's raw Bondian charisma supplying a thin veneer of dramatic gravitas."
1,Rotten,Surely it can't come as news to the filmmakers that a distinction exists between gender and sexuality?
1,Rotten,House of Wax aims low and hits the mark. It has all the gory bloodshed you could ask for and all the right special effects.
0,Fresh,"Funny, warm and snappily-paced by German-Turkish director Fatih Akin, it should satisfy audiences in the mood for comfort food."
0,Fresh,"Based on her painfully vulnerable performance, don't be surprised when the promising [Abbie] Cornish joins Hollywood's pool of Aussie ex-pats."
0,Fresh,"It's not WALL-E, but it does bear the same cross."
0,Fresh,"Primatologist David Okoye shares an extra-special bond with George, a fiercely intelligent gorilla with a giant heart. But their bromance goes south when a canister of weaponised DNA lands in George's leafy domain."
0,Fresh,It was fun. I like this kind of movie.
1,Rotten,"[A] hugely disappointing film, which goes beyond blunder into something akin to meltdown."
0,Fresh,"A winning, extraordinarily well-acted portrait of togetherness that pokes at common conventions with a playful, yet pointed stick."
1,Rotten,"Meehl seems entirely smitten by her subject matter...and her blind adoration is a double-edged sword, imbuing her film with tremendous warmth but also nullifying any hint of objectivity."
0,Fresh,Skin tone is crucial to understanding School Daze's brazenness as a major-studio film.
0,Fresh,A refreshingly kind and calm PG film that no one will be ashamed to see.
0,Fresh,"While it may not tell us anything new about the human condition, it is beautifully shot and impeccably acted, especially by screen newcomer Neiva."
0,Fresh,"This is a mature, beautifully crafted piece of work and much cleverer than it initially appears."
1,Rotten,"It ends up a one-joke picture, with feeble variations."
0,Fresh,"Gosford Park is less a sobering microcosm than it is comically subversive, a great, convoluted upending of period conventions."
1,Rotten,"Instead of the sass and sense of surreal surprise that we're used to, we get a new lead pair with no chemistry, a needlessly complex plot, and a bunch of unnecessary special effects."
0,Fresh,A dark and brooding story that only gets more disturbing over the course its 152 minute runtime.
0,Fresh,"Little is asked of talking-animal movies, save charm, heart, and at least one scene where said animal wears a lampshade. Good Boy! has all those things, + a winning story line."
0,Fresh,"Like many of the all-time great concert films, Springsteen On Broadway is no substitute for being in the room, but it's power transcends any perceived limitations."
0,Fresh,"Though all but the two lead children are mediocre, the adult actors, including Karen Allen and James Earl Jones, are first- rate."
0,Fresh,"In its emotional maturity and visual beauty, this is as dignified and fine as any children's movie I've seen in an inordinately long time."
0,Fresh,Rare Birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable.
0,Fresh,"An antidote to weepy tales such as ""Philadelphia"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"". Yes, Virginia, gay people can enjoy long-term relationships."
0,Fresh,"Carney and company make songs in loads of different 1980s genres, and all work perfectly. Combine that with a few nice, softer moments and a literal ""fist-pumping"" ending, and you have a film that's hard to dislike, even if it could stand more harmony."
0,Fresh,"Action and smarts don't necessarily go hand-in-hand. But director Nicolas Winding Refn ('Bronson') deftly blends them in 'Drive,' a phenomenally entertaining movie that employs a haunting soundtrack, clever direction and entertaining characters."
0,Fresh,"Persona is made up of clinical compositions, austere acting and stark lighting courtesy of legendary lensman Sven Nykvist. Yet it's this very severity that gives the film its crisp beauty."
0,Fresh,"It's easy to say that Denis Villeneuve's tingly sci-fi Arrival is a whole lot of Spielberg with a little bit of Tarkovsky thrown in, but what's remarkable is how much it actually defies the conventions of its genre."
0,Fresh,"The way to respond to a challenging movie like this, and to those who share its worldview, isn't to dismiss them - mother! is far too ambitious and interesting a film for that."
0,Fresh,"Deft performances, especially from Laia Costa in the title role, but much patience is required before the going gets good."
0,Fresh,"It's a gentle examining of life near its end. And with McKellen at its center, his face as gloriously long and complex as a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle plot, it's also a master class in acting."
1,Rotten,"I wasn't a fan of the original film, but at least it made some semblance of sense and was decently acted."
1,Rotten,The movie whips up a big old puree of ingredients borrowed from other cinematic recipes. Then it dishes out the mildly spiced results as post-Oscar-quality snack food...
0,Fresh,There's a real sense of desperation embedded in the core of the picture.
0,Fresh,That story in question is so damn satisfying. The Inventor is able to present the finer points of Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes's fraud satisfyingly enough - if not definitively.
1,Rotten,"Even ignoring the racism-which is pretty much impossible-No Escape is a clich-ridden, artless relic."
1,Rotten,"It's an interesting premise, with moments of tension and visceral gore, but Taylor-Johnson's performance isn't strong enough to rescue the film from lengthy stretches of banality."
1,Rotten,"No money should ever change hands in any Gone-related interaction, unless it is because you are buying matches and gasoline to set all the copies of it on fire."
0,Fresh,"Pretty far from being a great movie, but it's not without its pleasures -- mostly due to the performers."
1,Rotten,"This plodding, workmanlike version of the story often leaves you wondering why they bothered."
1,Rotten,A musical romance about tying beats-per-minute techno music to a dancer's heartbeat. It flatines.
1,Rotten,"As its narrative focuses increasingly on Julia's story and the toll her investigations take on her family life, the film digs into less and less fruitful territory."
1,Rotten,"Maybe with a different lead actor and about 20 minutes of running time chopped from it, I might have enjoyed it more. Instead I laughed through parts, but was never emotionally drawn into any of it."
0,Fresh,"Not much on plot or leaving one much to think about, but it sure was entertaining."
0,Fresh,"It's the coolest and strangest movie of the year, and once it gets its druglike hooks in your brain, you'll never get them out again."
0,Fresh,"Wiping away the bad taste X-Men Origins: Wolverine left us with, Deadpool easily overcomes its few minor flaws to deliver a satisfying, hilarious, and action-packed adventure."
1,Rotten,"Rather like a fungus-based meat substitute, this film feels as though it's good for you, but actually there are few lasting benefits."
0,Fresh,"Llewyn is a beautiful loser, the everyman artist who contributes to the evolution of music and helps set the stage for a Dylan but never reaps the final reward, punched out by a world ready to swoop in on his scene and leave him behind."
0,Fresh,"[Toback] gives us Iron Mike in all his monolithic multitudes and allows us, for a brief moment, to peer alongside him into the existential abyss."
0,Fresh,"If it left out the sugary moments, it would have been a solid comedic romp about former rivals finding pride and peace through punching the geriatric juice out of each other. (Review: Nathalie Lawson)"
0,Fresh,Competent rather than vivid or compelling.
0,Fresh,"Yakin's slick direction, marked by quick cuts, unstinting energy and a lack of sentimentality, makes the action scenes satisfying. But he's a better director than writer."
0,Fresh,An illuminating glimpse into some of the more challenging complications that contemporary relationships can present.
0,Fresh,The Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine 1987 musical Into the Woods has been transferred to the screen by director Rob Marshall with most of its complexities and light-dark tonalities intact.
0,Fresh,If you're a fan of Jackson's prolific Middle Earth than you're going to be a fan of this movie. If you came to see the original story of The Hobbit unfold then you'll like about 20 minutes.
0,Fresh,"Both Hawkins and Hawke are very good in Maudie, and if you're looking to qualify it you'd arrive first at the fact that they both effect physical transformations of a sort."
0,Fresh,"The student becomes the teacher, and it works."
0,Fresh,"Now 34, Tony opens his soul-searching, his home, his private moments with family & children so that the world can see the consequences of those that prey from the pulpit."
1,Rotten,"It's that kind of movie, full of therapeutic notions paraded as poetry and scenes that seem to carry explanatory labels."
0,Fresh,There are plenty of laughs along with the melodrama as the band and its members struggle through young adulthood.
1,Rotten,"""Only"" prioritizes ideas over scope, but it's a situation where a larger canvas would have helped. As a chamber piece, it can just go so far."
0,Fresh,"Love Is Strange is beautiful in every way that a film can be beautiful, and unabashedly so."
0,Fresh,"All four of the lead actors, especially Yeo and Koh, deliver naturalistic performances of a standard that will set the benchmark for years to come."
1,Rotten,The skateboarding footage is underwhelming compared to Dogtown.
1,Rotten,Lawrence's bold performance and her fearlessly sexual character are more than Russell knows how to harness.
1,Rotten,"Without [Kate] Winslet, The Reader would be just another literary adaptation that got high on its own self-importance."
1,Rotten,Isn't quite as funny or endearing as it would like to be.
1,Rotten,I wanted to laugh hardily but I hardly cracked a smile and definitely did not have my Kasbah rocked.
1,Rotten,"There are no allusions to the empowering nature of punk that catalyses the tale; and strangest of all, there's not enough made of the funny, funky music that made him filmworthy in the first place. The result, too often, rings like a missed beat."
1,Rotten,There are about six really good laughs during the film's 92-minute running length.
0,Fresh,"The film may ultimately leave you with the same empty feeling as Ellis's fiction, but it's often ingenious in its telling."
0,Fresh,"It's sweetness and Englishness shines through a truncated, tone-shifting script."
0,Fresh,"Half the living beings in the universe aren't at stake, just two lives. If you're ok with that after Infinity War, then this is the perfect superhero summer blockbuster palate cleanser."
1,Rotten,should have been funnier with this title
1,Rotten,Anyone interested in WikiLeaks and Assange in their multi-threaded intrigue would do well to seek out Alex Gibney's The Story of WikiLeaks and forget that this dud ever existed.
0,Fresh,"This acerbic, darkly poetic Coen brothers' take on the Cormac McCarthy novel is calculated to give you the willies."
0,Fresh,"It's often at its best when it's off on a moody tangent. But it has something and is well worth seeing, especially if you're a horror fan or a fan of art cinema"
1,Rotten,This is a shoddy affair with anodyne first-timers Blanchard and Cook almost as annoying as Ricky Gervais's phoned-in voiceover of an animatronic terrier with a poop obsession.
1,Rotten,"Movies are supposed to whisk you away, to make you get lost in their stories. I never got lost in From Time to Time because I was continually aware of the pieces being assembled before me."
1,Rotten,The film ends up being an overly emotional film which focuses an astonishing amount of time on watching Christine cry.
0,Fresh,"People with particularly indiscriminate taste in action cinema will enjoy The Replacement Killers on its own merits, and Chow and Sorvino fans will take away some enjoyment from watching them perform together"
1,Rotten,"In Search of Greatness, the latest from Gabe Polsky (Red Army), explores the passion, obsessiveness, and creativity in sports. But, though intriguing and sometimes adrenalizing, this search stumbles."
0,Fresh,This timelessly universal wish-fulfillment tale unfolds with endearing tenderness and a light touch.
0,Fresh,"Formula rules, as Ferrell applies his schtick to another sport. But there's enough silly spectacle and eye-popping costumes to compensate."
0,Fresh,"A gaudy, daring, operatic, and bloody funny provocation of a melodrama from Park Chan-wook."
1,Rotten,"A flat and clumsy paper-doll melodrama that even some gorgeous cinematography and a raft of gifted, great-looking actors can't save."
0,Fresh,"I'm the last person in the world to raise a stink about the environment... But that doesn't stop me from hoping that the kids get the message someday, before that March of the Penguins is just a lonely walk into extinction."
0,Fresh,"""Captain Phillips"" is riveting - a movie anchored by strong performances in which the human drama is as compelling as the overall story arc."
1,Rotten,"The film doesn't really explore technology, sex, or anything else that deeply."
1,Rotten,It's a struggle to find the bright side to this rather hackneyed film.
0,Fresh,"With any expectations of real-life adventure safely out of mind, you can relish 1997's megahit ""Air Force One"" as one heck of a joy ride."
0,Fresh,"It's all innocuous, forgettable fun, but it's firmly aimed at those who find underwear endlessly funny."
0,Fresh,Topsy-turvy hoot delivering a grim and confident fiasco full of clever contradictions and a couple of likeable champions of the hour in Tucker and Dale
0,Fresh,"If you liked any of the previous movies, you should be even more thrilled by what they've done this time around with a lot more at play here in terms of storytelling."
1,Rotten,"Roman Polanski (The Pianist, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown) is unquestionably a great filmmaker, but as Marina Zenovich's documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired perhaps unintentionally demonstrates, he's also a creep."
0,Fresh,"Writer-director Sollett has a honed, at-home cast and a deft, funny sense of eros. The many close-ups establish intimacy, though at times this feels like a case study in sex and urban density."
0,Fresh,"In boldface fact, 'Die Another Day' is the best Bond in years, and arguably ranks with the vintage Sean Connery set. Any Connery/Bond fan knows that is high-spy praise."
1,Rotten,"""Antichrist"" is a curious mash-up of cutting-edge torture-porn and good old porn-porn that fails on both fronts."
0,Fresh,"Despite its excessive length, this reverential doco will enthuse fans, historians and even those, like yours truly, whose familiarity with Beethoven is limited to the opening strains of his 5th Symphony."

1,Rotten,The film is entirely forgettable.
1,Rotten,"The result is cold and unconvincing, by turns dull and repellent."
0,Fresh,"With only one and a half gadgets on display, there's at least one itch that it doesn't scratch, but McKinnon is so well utilised here that The Spy Who Dumped Me is more worth seeing than its 41-year-old reference gag title would suggest."
0,Fresh,A character-driven drama about the ways the past intrudes on the characters' perceptions of what is possible for them.
0,Fresh,A stunning achievement of Homeric proportion and one we're likely to champion for decades to come.
0,Fresh,"The characters here deal with humiliation after humiliation, and usually, there's no ""Hollywood solution,"" like just punching your way out of danger. The danger is ever-present and all around you. Sometimes the characters have no choice but to suffer."
0,Fresh,The young cast throw themselves (quite literally) into their demanding assignments with vigor.
0,Fresh,"The Smith-Jones duo's return as the titularly clad operatives, while not exactly essential, comes with the charms of reprised, well-liked characters and a ""didn't-see-that-coming"" conclusion that makes up for the first hour's sequelitis."
0,Fresh,"It's all very appropriately overblown, and director Antal gives the fireworks as much attention as he does each performer."
0,Fresh,"One man's true story set against the Holocaust is a haunting, beautiful tale of humanity, horror and hope."
0,Fresh,"Draped with lively colors and strange settings that overindulge in absurdity, the film refuses to be dull under the weight of a genre that tries too hard for relevance."
1,Rotten,It just doesn't add up to the kind of laughs you want to pay to see.
1,Rotten,It heralds a note of spirituality that would be about the darnedest thing ever if it didn't feel borrowed from another movie that knocked us sideways with a similar shocker.
0,Fresh,"The Lighthouse works because of the strength of the actors' performances, the power of their interaction, and the aura of incipient dread that saturates everything."
0,Fresh,"Blitz gets too much mileage out of a pair of kooky (or kookily) Korean neighbors, but even that's mitigated by his unapologetic affection for the movie's cast of misfits, all of whom are somehow beautiful in their irredeemable f---ed-upness."
0,Fresh,"Hotel Mumbai is a great crowd pleaser but with a dangerously myopic narrative that, even with its flaws, serves a fitting tribute to the resilience of the people who lived and died through the terror attacks of 2008..."
0,Fresh,"Starts as a satire and ends as thriller, making the journey from the one to the other not just a logical progression, but an almost inevitable one."
1,Rotten,"Dad's Army has a lot of heart, and is certainly an amiable piece, but being uncynical is not enough to justify a trip to the cinema, as a film that offers little by way of jokes, or substantial narrative purpose."
0,Fresh,Any film that features an entrance by Christopher Walken strutting down a driveway to Elvis Presley's Trouble merits attention.
0,Fresh,An impressively engrossing contemporary musical...
1,Rotten,"The circuitous narrative of Nash Edgerton's Gringo is such that it never allows for a character or storyline to develop in a particularly efficient way, as every few minutes an abrupt twist or turn sets things off in a new and unexpected direction."
0,Fresh,"Detention, which will come out this year.. goes to the next level on meta movies. But Cabin isn't trying to be meta; it's focused on genre. Those are different types of satire so I can appreciate Cabin taking genre further than ever."
0,Fresh,"Seth Rogen specializes in comedies where sex comes before love, a practicality that happens far more often on earth than in shiny, starry meet-cute romances."
0,Fresh,"Meanders merrily along for 95 pain-free (and, honestly, mostly laugh-free) minutes before arriving at its entirely predictable destination."
0,Fresh,"The movie successfully reflects turmoil, looking at the world from the specific standpoint of a child who's ill-equipped to comprehend it, trying to survive as best he can."
1,Rotten,"If you're a rabid Cobain murder theorist, ""Soaked in Bleach"" will undoubtedly reconfirm all of your beliefs on the subject. If you're also certain that Cobain killed himself, I doubt that there's anything here to truly convince you otherwise."
0,Fresh,"A sharp, smart and robustly engaging film about a man at the end of his rope and his struggle to avoid hanging himself with it."
0,Fresh,The big surprise is that it also has just enough referential wit and nostalgic charm to keep the smiles coming through the schmaltz.
0,Fresh,Satisfies mainly due to its affecting ensemble and considerable emotional intelligence.
0,Fresh,"There's a sense of inevitability about things, certainly, but it seems less written in the stars than unhappily scratched onto the kerb with a flicknife by John himself."
0,Fresh,I'm glad I saw this movie because it allowed me to spend time with two engaging boys whose young lives are worth chronicling. But those lives can't bear the symbolic weight the filmmakers place on them. Nor should they have to.
1,Rotten,"Tingling jaws notwithstanding, the scariest thing going on here is the realization that this loser got picked up at Sundance."
0,Fresh,The film works largely through its cannily assembled cast.
1,Rotten,"Because Burns and Soderbergh choose to show a lot without saying anything, it's impossible to care."
1,Rotten,"It's a colourful movie, transposing the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice to the Rio de Janeiro carnival, but the story has little resonance and with very little reworking could as easily have been a Brazilian version of Carmen."
1,Rotten,"If the movies that make 'best lists' are filet mignon, the culinary comparison here probably is bait."
1,Rotten,The entertainment that one is able to derive from it is directly proportional to the appeal of each character. Those levels vary widely.
0,Fresh,All of these elements unfold in more a stream-of-thought manner than real design. And Waterhouse turns in a solid performance.
1,Rotten,"If you've seen the trailer, you've seen almost everything good in Bad Company."
1,Rotten,"The biggest crime isn't the husband's attempt to steal his wife from jail. It's that with Paul Haggis' remake of the taut French thriller Pour Elle, the story's been robbed of its bite."
0,Fresh,A thumping piece of powerhouse cinema.
1,Rotten,"like the film's pair of conflicted snuff customers, you're only getting what you paid your money for."
1,Rotten,"""It's as if the lessons that were learned by the widely loathed, 2007 'three-quel' Spider-Man 3 were lost on the filmmakers and studio, who are condemned to repeat those mistakes of the past."""
0,Fresh,This cast is pretty much note perfect.
1,Rotten,"No better than most of the genre stuff that studios regularly shovel into theatres nowadays, and in some ways worse."
1,Rotten,"For all its exertions, the film spends most of its time merely treading water."
1,Rotten,"If you're weirdly disinterested in the promotion of Herzlinger's career, this movie may offer all the delight of being slowly dragged by a pickup truck along a stretch of remote rural flat-top."
0,Fresh,... one of the grandest and most glorious spectacles of the silent era.
0,Fresh,"Just like you didn't need to know your fastball from your highball to enjoy that terrific film [MONEYBALL], so too The Big Short lets you in even if you can't tell your Collateralised Debt Obligations from your Credit Default Swaps. Don't miss it."
1,Rotten,Truly abysmal and half-hearted attempt to keep this particular cash-boat afloat. Where's the John Landis I remember?
1,Rotten,"While this idea may have been enough to happily fill 25 minutes, the film version fails to effectively stretch it out to feature-length."
1,Rotten,Director Quentin Depieux's drab palette doesn't do much to up the ante of a movie that's as slender as one of the fringes on Georges's beloved jacket.
1,Rotten,"A clich-ridden, heavy-handed redemptive drama written and directed by Rustam Branaman."
1,Rotten,"The movie seems to spring from a curious awareness of how unnecessary it is, and it responds in the manner of an uninvited guest, with no interest in behaving or ingratiating itself."
1,Rotten,The film gets even more sentimental as it strains not to be so.
1,Rotten,More of the same does not a good sequel make.
0,Fresh,"An entertainment that's as smart, witty, stylish and exhilarating as any movie lover could wish for."
1,Rotten,"Ben Stiller looks the same as he did during Parents in 2000, but pity poor Teri Polo who's putting on miles faster than Dale Earnhardt, Jr."
1,Rotten,"Like Antonioni, Dickinson is less interested in narrative structure and character development, but there's a problem here: He has nothing new to say about technology, alienation and the lost art of romance."
0,Fresh,A dazzling film.
1,Rotten,"Pretentious, long-winded."
0,Fresh,"It's a film that's loving toward all concerned, even when they cause each other pain. And it is overwhelmingly, refreshingly sincere even while being revisionist."
0,Fresh,"So well animated, voiced, written, and directed, it defines itself as one of the best animated flicks this summer, rightfully standing beside 'Monster House' and 'Cars.'"
1,Rotten,"With so much being thrown on screen, the story feels fractured and schizophrenic. There's an intriguing story buried amidst the chaos, but it gets a little lost."
1,Rotten,"The cruel simplicity of the atrocity is made needlessly chaotic by artless camerawork that swishes rapidly back and forth across the action, to the accompaniment of a syrupy soundtrack."
1,Rotten,"It is not a total failure by any means but, unlike its title character, it proves itself to be far to willing to settle and move on instead of trying to do something riskier and more potentially rewarding."
0,Fresh,"In a starry line-up it's Jude Law who commands most presence, playing the charmer so well that his absence in the latter half leaves a gaping void."
0,Fresh,"An affectionate buddy road movie about baseball, elder belligerence, and uneasy male bonding between two odd couple mentally challenged guys. And while one appears to have simply lost his mind, the other can't seem to keep track of his."
0,Fresh,"Like the title character, you aren't likely to forget it - and find yourself rooting for it against your better judgment."
0,Fresh,Spectators will be entertained with a series of characters that reveal the necessity to hide and isolate themselves in an abandoned home rather than just scaring with blood and deaths. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,It's a film that engages you in many small ways even if the plot thread tying everything together is never quite satisfying.
1,Rotten,"When [James] starts winning some bouts and becoming a contender, the movie's credibility skyrockets into ""Rocky"" territory and beyond."
0,Fresh,"Obeys many conventions of the genre, trying its best to plunge viewers into a world that, while seemingly liberated of bourgeois proprieties, is actually a narrowly constricted prison of desperation and need."
0,Fresh,Plays a lot better than it sounds. Trust me.
0,Fresh,"If you're looking for a prequel to the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, you're not going to do much better than this one."
0,Fresh,"Theirs is a marriage of convenience, it is true, but also of love. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,An intriguing indie and certainly one-of-a-kind. The Coen Bros. likely would approve.
0,Fresh,It's refreshing to see a film that not only spotlights a queer Asian American woman but also treats her with such respect and tenderness.
0,Fresh,"More an action blockbuster than a horror squelcher, it contains spectacular crowd scenes that have a Hieronymus Bosch quality, but the film lacks strong meat - of the emotional and bloody zombie-cannibal sort."
0,Fresh,"Though pretty standard action-horror fare, Underwater came at a time when winter nights are long and the popcorn hot. Audiences could do far worse than trekking to the bottom of the sea."
1,Rotten,Difficult to swallow are the heavy-handed narrative developments that dominate the film's second half.
0,Fresh,"After a sluggish start, things do improve but there are obvious structural echoes of Frozen and the incidental comedy is clumsy. Good but not great."
1,Rotten,...an inscrutable sci-fi excursion that is filled with tension and outstanding special effects and production design without making a bit of sense...like going to a whodunit and when the movie ends not having a clue whodunit.
1,Rotten,"The more recurrent noise towards the end was me groaning with disappointment, that a movie which had struck gold with its central matchmaking was succeeding so ruthlessly in taking the shine off."
0,Fresh,Charming Depression-era road movie comedy.
1,Rotten,More of a TV mystery show spirit than that of a powerful feature climax.
0,Fresh,"Despite being light in the story department, The Crimes of Grindelwald offers plenty of small pleasures and tightens up the linkage between this series and Harry Potter."
0,Fresh,"With the events of Ferguson so fresh in our memories, Selma is uncomfortable yet necessary viewing."
0,Fresh,It's a gut punch to every single person who has come to the wholly depressing conclusion that the world our grandparents enjoyed may not exist for our children.
1,Rotten,"Though rife with worthy intentions and great notions, this populist safari manages to be both patronizing and manipulative."
0,Fresh,Negga... has an innate gentleness that makes her situation all the more intolerable. And Edgerton... manages to mix level-headed with being a little bit dense. Both are quite convincing.
1,Rotten,Acker's film seems to go out of its way to avoid being epic.
1,Rotten,"The problem of Oz is not the debt it owes to previous storytellers. It's one thing to remake, or reimagine, a fairy tale. It's quite another to trade in the tired tropes of centuries."
0,Fresh,Do we even care about these characters enough to worry about their machinations?
0,Fresh,It's worth a watch to see these two reliably comic actors do some heavy dramatic lifting and tenderly spot for each other.
1,Rotten,"A convenient, unprepossessing time-waster for Saturday afternoon kiddies."
0,Fresh,"The Punisher is a guy whose every bomb goes off, whose strategies of decimation never fail, who gets shot, beaten to a pulp and pulls together as only a comic strip hero can."
0,Fresh,"""Absolute Power"" wanders. Yet, the movie is worth seeing simply because of Eastwood's presence, his (and Green's) camera, his excellent cast."
1,Rotten,The film is agonizingly slow.
0,Fresh,"It's also fascinating to see the always nakedly political franchise turn its lens on American racism, and it adds a new spark that was oddly lacking from the more workmanlike Ip Man 3."
0,Fresh,Like the best Charles Dickens novels it demands we grow indignant at the cause.
0,Fresh,"If Last Holiday were a song, it'd be one of Earth, Wind and Fire's brassier anthems of uplift and self-realization."
1,Rotten,"Chaotic, wildly unevern kids' fluff."
0,Fresh,A rare on-the-road movie from a female point of view.
0,Fresh,Newcastle-born stand-up comedian Dave Johns plays this largely non-comedic part with understated warmth.
0,Fresh,"One can argue whether 'Spree' indicts social-media obsession or just cheerfully embraces it, but if hardly a totally fun ride it's a fitfully fascinating one."
1,Rotten,"It's a tough-as-nails action thriller, and all those nails are hammered directly into the movie's own coffin."
1,Rotten,"You just cannot help but think that they thought it was a good idea at the time, started rolling and realised it was too late to rethink"
1,Rotten,"The plot is an afterthought, the performances given with a wink and a clip-emptying flourish."
0,Fresh,"Aside from having a title that turns me into a puerile, sniggering teenager every time I talk about it, The Beaver is a heartbreakingly good movie."
0,Fresh,"At age 78, director Claude Chabrol is more than capable of giving us a completely realized world."
1,Rotten,The only way The Reaping could be worse would be if Swank put on a bear suit and ran through the woods.
0,Fresh,"Thankfully, there's enough moment-to-moment action engagement to make Bushwick an enjoyable ride, even as it intellectually falters."
0,Fresh,"""Results"" isn't always a successful film, but its philosophies about the myths of perfection as they apply to love are at least credible, funny and well observed."
0,Fresh,"Although not the most original film in the Disney vault, Planes is nevertheless entertaining, engaging, high-flying fun and adventure that will put your head in the clouds and wind beneath your wings!"
0,Fresh,"Viewed through the prism of the recession, ""Larry Crowne"" is a perversely upbeat training film for discarded, obsolete, over-the-hill workers."
0,Fresh,Most lawyers are content to fight their battles far from the public eye. Gloria Allred isn't like most lawyers.
0,Fresh,"Like the improvised nature of jazz, Don Cheadle's biopic about Miles Davis brings a syncopated view on the legendary musician and trumpet player's life as it scats around his turbulent life."
0,Fresh,"CRAZY RICH ASIANS is a whirlwind of delight --- attractive actors, stunning couture, spectacular sets and outrageous parties. It's a feast for the eyes. But what really makes this dramedy work is the acting."
0,Fresh,"Her bracing humor, candor and conviction remain undiminished."
1,Rotten,"Full of superficial drama but empty of emotional substance, Rise of the Lycans explains how everything happened in the first two films but fails to address why, which is why both longtime fans and newcomers will still feel they've been left in the dark."
0,Fresh,Taylor Swift reflects on her rise to stardom and her role as a social influencer in this intimate and sincere confessional. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,It's only a movie about men at work in war. Yet it seems like a definitive war movie.

0,Fresh,It's one of the most beguilingly beautiful and heart-tugging films of the year so far.
0,Fresh,"In a film as benign and forgiving as The Horse Whisperer, it's only fair to forgive Redford for showing a little bit of vanity. He deserves it."
1,Rotten,Dark Phoenix's lack of imagination is all the more disappointing because it glimmers of promise early on.
1,Rotten,"Ay carumba-blimey, what a mess."
1,Rotten,"All surface beauty, no substance. Zhang Yimou is a master but this film lacks storytelling prowess."
0,Fresh,Shrek Forever After is not that bad. That's what we've come to... evaluating a multi-million dollar summer tent-pole release as 'not that bad.'
0,Fresh,...an unabashedly high-concept premise that's primarily employed to surprisingly positive effect...
0,Fresh,"Just like Trainwreck elevated Amy Schumer to being a household name, The Big Sick really could do the same for Kumail Nanjiani."
1,Rotten,This 1957 film delivers a lot in the talk department and not so much in the logic department.
0,Fresh,"Akira Kurosawa's Samurai take on King Lear is brutal but brilliant, a startling transposition to match his earlier Macbeth adap Throne Of Blood."
1,Rotten,There is every indication that most of the cast didn't feel Thunder was worth the expenditure of excessive effort.
0,Fresh,"Prince of Persia has the high-spirited air of an old-fashioned boys' action-adventure movie but, tuned to modern audiences, the conflict is predictably amplified, accelerated and constant."
1,Rotten,A Watergate burglary story and its aftermath deserves a better telling than this.
0,Fresh,Soft-edged and sweet.
1,Rotten,"Imagine this conversation: A phone call between actor Bob De Niro and director Marty Scorsese. Bobby: Hello, Marty. I've been calling and texting, but you never answer. (Silence) Bobby: I'm talking to you. Are you talkin' to me? Are you talkin' to me?"
0,Fresh,Silver Linings Playbook is a quirky adult romantic comedy that goes beyond the standard rhythms of the genre.
0,Fresh,"It's disheartening that Deforest Kelly, James Doohan, and series creator Gene Roddenberry won't be able to see their legacy ""beam"" back to life and continue at warp speed."
1,Rotten,"Cop Out is unspeakably terrible, a laugh-free comedy that mistakenly thinks it's the height of hilarity while the audience, in return, sit stone-faced for the better part of two hours."
0,Fresh,"The story is simply told with a lot of talking, some loving and much philosophizing over the meaning of life. The good thing is that [writer-director-editor] Andrew Haigh wears all his hats well and shows a deft hand at all his chores."
0,Fresh,"Very much a rousing, indomitable-human-spirit kind of story, except that by some miracle, most of the saccharine was left out of the recipe. The end result is a movie everyone will enjoy."
1,Rotten,This is precisely the type of moviegoing experience engineered for those who still get a laugh when the Baha Men hit Who Let the Dogs Out? accompanies a doggie mayhem montage.
1,Rotten,A movie nobody will mistake as one of King's better adaptations.
0,Fresh,"The flashback sequences are vibrant and intense, and the film's long closing shot is so dense with feeling for a nation and its people that Bose deserves to be noted as a filmmaker to watch."
1,Rotten,What a horrible way to kick off 2011.
0,Fresh,"Watching this movie, I feel the need to run to the mall or someplace, and find a Chinese baby to hug. Or, at least, I can hug my own daughters."
0,Fresh,"The Fault in Our Stars is exceptionally high-quality mainstream entertainment, a genuine work of art that exists in the often maligned sub-genre of teen girl-centric melodrama."
1,Rotten,"Supremely condescending...If you need to look down on others to feel better about yourself, 'Napoleon Dynamite' is the movie for you."
0,Fresh,"It's shamelessly partial but also warmly pleasurable, partly because Mr. Linklater is an engaging and humble conversationalist who moves easily to the beat of his own soundtrack."
1,Rotten,It's too diluted.
0,Fresh,Pleasant little comedy with lots and lots of gags.
1,Rotten,"A tedious run-through of all-too- familiar plot points, spiced up with lots of banged heads and people getting thrown out of windows."
0,Fresh,"Ready Player One captures the gee-whiz youthful triumphalism of the Reagan era, all right, but it never explores the deeper question of whether all that is worth rehashing - over and over."
0,Fresh,"Engrossing, well-shot bio-pic ... which won seven Cesars, including Best Picture, from the French Academy in 2008, has a gorgeous antique look and a surfeit of empathy. A lovely, lingering film."
0,Fresh,Miss Hawn is as sweetly zany as ever. She has clearly established herself as the most delightful comedienne now working in movies ...
0,Fresh,"Snappy script, sharp editing, eerily perfect soundtrack and nuanced performances. One of the first films to articulate the psychological power and draw of the internet: what it feeds us and why we feed on it"
0,Fresh,"It is a film that is worthy of -- and will likely inspire -- a great deal of discussion, contemplation, debate, and yes, even criticism. And it may be the movie I most enjoyed talking about with others in 2016."
1,Rotten,There are enough pieces of this story missing or detached from context that hockey here does start to become the kind of metaphor that the movie seems to want to avoid.
1,Rotten,Justin Timberlake can not carry a movie on his own and this one sinks under his efforts. Still the plot of the movie is pretty much run of the mill in its own right
1,Rotten,"Edgar Rice Burroughs' hero returns to the screen, played by Alexander Skarsgård; he's a handsome fellow but with little screen charisma and less chemistry with co-star Margot Robbie."
0,Fresh,"Tony Todd gives a memorable performance in the title role, projecting both intelligence and malice."
0,Fresh,"...a wonderful stand-in for childhood itself, when kids often have adventures involving things only they can see."
1,Rotten,A perfect example of a movie that does as very little as possible
1,Rotten,Little more than an adolescent wish-fulfillment fantasy so familiar that it's like pre-chewed bubble gum.
0,Fresh,"Rogen and Goldberg (making their directorial debuts) get the balance just right, with one gut-busting punchline and situation after another set against the escalating dread of the end of existence, taking place just outside of James Franco's house."
1,Rotten,"Just loud, boorish frat-boy wish-fulfilmment stuff, festooned with wink-wink celebrity cameos."
0,Fresh,"It's not the best superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly entertaining & enjoyable enough for both superhero fans and those simply looking for some depth and characterization mixed with their comic book action. (Full Parental Review also available)"
1,Rotten,Who Killed the Electric Car? has no focus or reason apart from its history lesson.
0,Fresh,"From the conversations shot through filmy drapes glowing with blobs of candlelight to treks through tall golden grass, dozens of individual shots are breathtaking in their composition."
0,Fresh,Alicia Scherson's enthralling Il Futuro asks the question no one wants to hear: How would you see the world after a personal tragedy?
0,Fresh,Rec 2 is the only movie in the entire festival that left me wanting more. It's a nonstop rollercoaster ride that grabs the audiences by the throat and never lets go. You breathe when the credits hit and not a single second before.
1,Rotten,"With heroes like these, who needs terrorists?"

1,Rotten,Who could have possibly thought any of this is funny?
1,Rotten,"In spite of a few moving scenes, it's labored, too long and too gorgeously shot."
0,Fresh,"Sparse and fraught with tension, ""Bad Turn Worse"" is a smart character piece with a deadly edge."
0,Fresh,"If you can withstand the initial burst of salty language and severe dysfunction, there's a certain joy in seeing these characters get their just deserts. And not to give too much away, at least a couple of them do."
0,Fresh,A mildly amusing bayou farce with plenty of 'foosball' action to liven the sometimes plodding proceedings.

0,Fresh,"I would never dream of arguing that this is any form of good cinema, but as the subject of a mindless, violent little B-Movie, Mike Banning has gotten the job done once again."
1,Rotten,"Without question the most pedestrian of all the Trek movies, The Final Frontier is a watchable yet frustratingly wrong-footed, forgettable effort."
0,Fresh,It offers supremely satisfying versions of all the conventions we expect from the series ... and then it does the one thing you don't expect a James Bond movie to do: It breaks your heart.
0,Fresh,"It's like art-rockers Roxy Music let loose on Frankenstein - ludicrous, but oddly compelling. And it even stars Meat Loaf."

0,Fresh,And is there a better director working today that can find just the right song to capture the mood of the story on screen?
1,Rotten,"The schmaltz content gets higher and higher, as if administered through a drip feed, until by the end we are drowning in sucrose."
1,Rotten,"Rocketman aspires to nothing more than colourful reportage of a life already well-known to the public, dissolving into an encyclopedia entry as the final title cards inform us that things turned out alright for this ""Elton John"" fellow."
1,Rotten,"A pretty good idea. A lame execution. Serenity/i> goes all the way with its far-fetched story, but fails to deliver a good cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]."

0,Fresh,"If you can get over the idea of Sherlock Holmes as an action hero -- and if, indeed, you want to -- then there is something to enjoy about this flagrant makeover of fiction's first modern detective into a man of brawn as much as brain."
1,Rotten,The whole experience is all over the place.
0,Fresh,"What's fantastic, though, is that [it] juxtaposes this inner turmoil with the greater problems facing South Africa in the 80s."
0,Fresh,"Though not as explicitly focused on memory as Waltz with Bashir, Lebanon's style lends its own dredged-from-memory, expressionistic rawness."

0,Fresh,Highly recommended.
0,Fresh,"It is an uneasy mix, but the stars own the fizzy dialogue with such brio, electricity and pure charisma that they provide the real explosive power."
0,Fresh,A character study wrapped in a detective story that serves as a sly bit of self-promotion to boot.
0,Fresh,"Right from the start, Hayden Christensen is a revelation."
1,Rotten,"Though Hunt shows fitful signs of life, it lacks the human drama of Das Boot, the technical dazzle of The Abyss and the old-fashioned brio of Run Silent, Run Deep."
1,Rotten,"A splashy but slapdash nostalgia trip that, while offering a few good moments, is mostly underthought and overdone."
0,Fresh,"Herzog's format is well-organized, and his array of talking heads interesting, but they're pretty much telling us what we already know."
1,Rotten,An off-key comedy that has all the hallmarks of a desperate makeover...
1,Rotten,"Pitched somewhere between a frothy Hollywood romantic comedy and a more sophisticated European family drama, Susanne Bier's Love Is All You Need succeeds as neither."
1,Rotten,A ghastly representation of longing and screen chemistry. It couldn't make the nuances of attraction more unpleasant if it tried.
1,Rotten,Parental Content Review
1,Rotten,"""The Girl Next Door"" is an adolescent fantasy for bookish boys who must also contend with their hormones. This is their outlet. Let the boy next door dream."
1,Rotten,"The central joke in this low-budget comedy should have been a springboard to something either blackly hilarious or more amusingly complex, but the filmmakers seem to have run out of ideas after coming up with the title."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, this movie isn't"
0,Fresh,A stranger-than-fiction gem.
1,Rotten,"This is one of those impossible horror movies, like the kind about giant radioactive ants or invading aliens who want to steal our water. Lisa is just a crazy psychotic bitch..."
1,Rotten,"Like most of those movies that purport to tell it like it is for the fashionably chic young, the result is as cheesy and sentimental as it pretends to be streetwise."
0,Fresh,"If it's spellbinding special effects and high-wire acts you crave, Wanted should be at the top of your list for big budget thrill rides."
0,Fresh,"Trying to please a crowd needn't be a shameful business. Tom McCarthy makes light comedies that notice the goodness and hospitality in unlikely people, yet stop short of sentimentalising them."
0,Fresh,"This lively adaptation plays up the novel's more farcical elements, granting it a snappy, rhythmic pace."
1,Rotten,It was like watching a basketball game trying to focus on the point guard match-ups and the centers....but the story just wasn't something I bought all the way through; I was never convinced that Tommy Lee Jones' character could complete this journey.
0,Fresh,"One one level, ""Pride"" is as fake as a lip-sync revue, yet the emotions it arouses are real."
0,Fresh,"Leaps well beyond the rather humble bonds of a mediocre cancelled TV show into the realm of amazing, adventure filmmaking."
1,Rotten,"Though based on an inspirational true story, Edgerton's Boy Erased is too cluttered and unfocused to deliver either new insight or a good cry."
0,Fresh,A dreary but diverting high-altitude romance that's superimposed onto a classic story of survival.
0,Fresh,"A nicely nasty thriller -- and the less you know before seeing it, the more you'll enjoy it."
1,Rotten,"It's a little cheap to have a sequel that merely completes the story you SHOULD have told in Part 1, but as sequels go, this one's not bad."
0,Fresh,"Here's a film for adults. It's also about time to recognize that Mr. Ivory is one of our finest directors, something that critics tend to overlook because most of his films have been literary adaptations."
0,Fresh,Lee is sensational on all counts in a final performance that brims over with athleticism and ardor.
1,Rotten,"Yes, while it aims to combine celebrity voices, memorable music and Christian values, The Prince of Egypt this ain't."
1,Rotten,Ready Player One won't be remembered as Spielberg's worst film but it's not his best either. It's a purgatory state of a film that understands the appeal of the book but fails to convey those aspects in a satisfactory manner.
1,Rotten,Pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making this horrific crime seem dull.
0,Fresh,"It's an exorcism movie for everyone who thought, after Mungiu's gruelling abortion buddy-movie 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, that this guy should do an exorcism movie"
0,Fresh,"No, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" doesn't reinvent the cinematic wheel, but it cruises along, pun intended, by merging familiar ideas into something that's engaging and original."

1,Rotten,"What is good about this film is very good, but there are too many side trips, in both the plot and the emotions, for the film to draw us in fully."
0,Fresh,"All in all, it really depends on if you're a fan of the two leads. I am, so I liked it."
0,Fresh,"It's a brave endeavour, held together by Robert Elswit's poetic photography, and by Irons' authoritative impression of the crumbling desperation behind the chalk-dusted facade of a pensive history man."
0,Fresh,The movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it.
0,Fresh,"Dig into Pixar's delicious, well-crafted rat tale."
0,Fresh,"Funny, touching, understated. Melancholy, bittersweet, lovely."
0,Fresh,"It's remarkable how many things ""First Class"" gets right, whether it's the decision to have characters speak different languages as the film's frequent globe-trotting dictates, or the casting of Fassbender and McAvoy."
0,Fresh,"There are actors and then there are stars, and in Stronger, Gyllenhaal shows why he falls into the latter category."
1,Rotten,"There's plenty of material for a great movie in the lives and work of the stuntmen and women in Hong Kong's thriving action film industry. Unfortunately, this isn't that movie."
1,Rotten,"Palmer's committed portrayal generates sympathy more than the lurid screenplay, which feels like an inauthentic glimpse into life on the streets."
0,Fresh,"Sandi Tan directs a documentary that functions in two levels, one as a self-portrait and one as a mystery story regarding the disappearance and the rediscovery of the film. The great thing about ""Shirkers"" is that both aspects work extremely well,"
0,Fresh,"The greatest success of Ixcanul, about a Maya woman living in the Guatemalan mountains, is that it makes you feel as though you have come to deeply understand a culture that is so deeply unfamiliar to us"

0,Fresh,Central Station tugs the heartstrings with the best of them.
1,Rotten,"The appeal, perhaps, will be strongest to the young."
0,Fresh,"Seen today, Eraserhead may make no more sense than it did 30 years ago, but its casually sinister air can now be seen as so much a part of Lynch's mature work."
1,Rotten,A biopic in which the star transcends himself but is badly let down by the storytelling.
0,Fresh,Pat O'Connor gives the story a sturdy if rather old-fashioned treatment.
0,Fresh,Totally silly! Most triumphant!
0,Fresh,"By completely changing the tone and focus of the film, Nolan smartly makes it nearly impossible to compare Rises to its predecessor."
1,Rotten,Make a stand to Hollywood and vote with your wallet: We all deserve a better live-action talking-dog movie than this.

0,Fresh,"Watching A Scanner Darkly, we can feel [Philip K.] Dick's world close in on us. And we can be glad we're only visitors."
1,Rotten,"Hopefully, this decent but uncomplicated movie isn't a final acting hurrah for Clint Eastwood."
0,Fresh,"Becomes bizarrely comical as it gets increasingly depraved. But Herzog's deliberately bonkers approach, matched by Cage's hammy performance, is strangely entertaining."
0,Fresh,"""Bully"" is a good start to a necessary conversation, but its loving voice is likely to be drowned out by haters who hide their own wounded hearts behind Internet pseudonyms and broadcast microphones."
0,Fresh,"If director Steven Spielberg's past close encounters with benevolent aliens seems worlds away, his habitual technical mastery hasn't deserted him."
1,Rotten,A movie on the road to nowhere
0,Fresh,"It's in parts a heist movie and a chase movie, but not an homage in any sense, more an evolution, like a 21st century fast-food hybrid."

0,Fresh,"Captain Sullenberger may not have sought the limelight, but he more than deserved it, and Sully is a fitting testament to his humble courage."
0,Fresh,"Real life comes crashing into Anderson-ville... and for the first time in his career, the filmmaker seems to be playing the pain for real, without any sight gags or ironic distance to cushion the blow."
1,Rotten,"The movie ultimately feels exhausting, raising issues it doesn't have the energy to address (about morality, the role of journalists, the public's right to know) and presenting a wide-eyed Rice as a lamb led to slaughter."
0,Fresh,A potent and thoughtful film.
0,Fresh,"Schnabel's set design, onstage projections, and postproduction add a good deal of visual noise to Reed & company's aural variety, which reproduces the album with a mixture of professional exactitude and unpredictable cacophony."
0,Fresh,"Maybe this geekily precise, Keanu Reeves-fronted documentary fretting over the death of celluloid needs to give digital its due."
1,Rotten,"Follows a relatively well-tread formula, which is perhaps why it feels so inert. It's a good, relative surface-level reading of events, but the man-on-a-crusade approach feels so much more dramatic than it needs to be."
1,Rotten,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace gives us a great set up for what is to come in the future with Anakin & Palpatine. And for that, I am thankful. The rest is not great."
0,Fresh,"It's Alien for a new generation; from the get-go it has that same air about it, a feeling of fear and foreboding, with the opening score setting the tone."
1,Rotten,"I don't know who I disliked more intensely -- Nelson, the abrupt, insulting ad man played by Keanu Reeves, or Sara, Charlize Theron's narcissistic martyr."

0,Fresh,"With inspired judgment and skill, the film embeds its debating points in the trajectory of the story, or humanises them with everyday emotions."
0,Fresh,"In the Heat of the Night (1967) is a tense whodunit detective story thriller that is set in the little town of Sparta, Mississippi during a hot summer"
1,Rotten,A loose-knit coming-of-age tale for which perhaps the best word is baffling...
1,Rotten,"With no suspense, no surprises and no rush, it's just soft core torture porn."
0,Fresh,"Miraculously, the sensory overload high consistently lasts its almost two-hour runtime."

1,Rotten,"While the visuals are extraordinary and the wry humour is welcome, what's missing is a coherent story with light and shade"
0,Fresh,"Writer-director Marc Lawrence's script is clever, and he has created memorable supporting roles for Kristen Johnson, as Barrymore's wild sister, and for Haley Bennett, as the Shakira shimmy-alike."
1,Rotten,"TV material. Kelly Rippa should have played the nanny, Kathie Lee Gifford should have played the Laura Linney role, Verne Troyer should have played the kid--and a mutt should have played that dog."
0,Fresh,Whether you find the result tedious or enlightening will be a factor of your openness to the director's languidly atmospheric approach.
1,Rotten,Ultimately even Bardem...can't rescue what's essentially a long dirge from feeling manipulative and forced.

0,Fresh,"The story is slow-moving and simple, but Schultze gets the blues is worth it as a peculiar small-scale adventure."
1,Rotten,Air Guitar Nation plays less like a feature-length documentary than it does a poorly thrown together behind-the-scenes supplement to the real thing.
0,Fresh,"Child's Pose treads a delicate line between social horror and comedy-so much so that, as with Lazarescu, it's not always immediately apparent that the comedy is present."
0,Fresh,"It's not quite as smart as Creed, or quite as beautiful, and it doesn't have as much depth or nuance or texture. But it's got enough to deliver something satisfying and sweet."

1,Rotten,"Jennifer Lopez has serious beefcake issues in this lazy, low-budget, not-as-much-fun-as-it-should-be potboiler."

0,Fresh,"This might ultimately be not much more than an exercise in visual montage, but with the help of a powerful score from Daniel Hart, the effect is mesmerising and, yes, haunting."
0,Fresh,A worthy genre entry and certainly better than most recent horror movies -- thanks mostly to its lead.
1,Rotten,The screenplay contains some big laughs scattered between a series of labored and uninspired gags that don't play to the strengths of its stars.
0,Fresh,"There's a shift in perspective around the hour mark that doesn't work as elegantly as it should, but the cast carry it over the hump."
0,Fresh,"Once in a while, a budget indie film comes along that makes us glad this art form is still around. After We Leave is a shining example of indie filmmaking at its finest."
0,Fresh,Writer and director Carlo Mirabella-Davis's first feature is both a superb and distressing pastel-colored portrait of the crumbling psyche of a housewife.

0,Fresh,"Passion, in this tender, intimate story, is ageless."
0,Fresh,"Nigel Cole knows where he is going with Made in Dagenham and, utilising some terrific period detail and capturing a great chemistry between the ensemble, assuredly delivers the crowd-pleasing final scenes."
1,Rotten,...A lethally dull and spiritually deadening exercise whose strained black humor and self-importance makes even the profundities of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy feel meaningful by comparison.
1,Rotten,"If you do not like Stay, it will not be because of the quality of the acting or the physicality of the setting they work in. Instead, it will be that you cannot or will not understand what Forster & company are on about in their surreal drama."
1,Rotten,"If there were a hint of a sense of play or humor in the filmmaking, beyond a briefly amusing moment of comeuppance for a foppish slaveowner, Pompeii might be a fun February diversion instead of a dull, eye-rolling slog."
1,Rotten,"Working from an original story by [James] Ellroy, [David] Ayer's overwrought Kings splashes around in the slop, but its conclusions seem a little rote from these two, who have both expressed their bottomless cynicism more effectively in the past."
1,Rotten,"Younger children should find D.A.R.Y.L. fairly entertaining, but this is barely tolerable for anyone else."
1,Rotten,"It's harmless enough for young kids, but director Todd Holland seems to have little interest in making anything but a generic, instantly forgettable family-friendly feature."
0,Fresh,"Everyone in the movie appears to be having a very good time, an attractive quality in a comedy. You may laugh out loud in spite of yourself."
1,Rotten,"If taken seriously, this is one of the stupidest movies in recent memory. Fortunately, there's a healthy dose of unintentional hilarity along the way, at least until it reaches stoppage time."
0,Fresh,What a great directorial debut from writer Billy Ray!
0,Fresh,A barebones-budgeted sci-fi B picture that's more of an intellectual exercise than a source of chills and thrills.
1,Rotten,"Without a particularly funny nor compelling lead, the hits in the already scattershot script are weakened, to say nothing of the misses."
1,Rotten,A distressingly lifeless concoction.
1,Rotten,Watching this film is the damnedest experience because it labors over the smallest points of the most inconsequential scenes and then hurries past the big emotional climaxes.
0,Fresh,A brilliant grassroots take on the humble beginnings and eventual demise of a musical movement that ultimately had far more impact than it would have ever imagined.
0,Fresh,Indie darling Lee Toland Krieger has managed to pull off this high concept film with an innocent charm that harks back to Golden Age Hollywood romance.
1,Rotten,"Nothing written here will stop this film from being a huge hit, but don't say you weren't warned."
0,Fresh,For many women who see it - and quite a few men too - it will instantly become a landmark moment in cultural history.
1,Rotten,"The market is now firmly established for the goofy, middle-aged bros-gone-wild genre"
0,Fresh,[Gosling's] swagger is good enough but not so great that I'm jealous of his lines. That's Mr. Notebook for you.
0,Fresh,"As befits the subject, with his taste for the romantic repertoire, Shine' is not afraid of stirring up big emotions. It earns them honorably."
0,Fresh,"Stars Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and Rose Byrne have long deserved vehicles to showcase their talents, and here they're finally afforded the opportunities their schlubby male contemporaries were offered a long time ago."

0,Fresh,"This thing works on many levels, and it's pretty darned cute."
0,Fresh,Great production design; if only the ending weren't so lame.
1,Rotten,So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic.
0,Fresh,"A ridiculous and ridiculously fun 154 minutes of utterly unhinged, completely over-the-top robotic mayhem. And with a moral, no less."
1,Rotten,"The only consistent laughs come from Michael Peña's eccentric hired killer, the movie's one character who seems like someone we haven't seen a million times before."
0,Fresh,"While obviously reverent, the film never quite soars the way other recent films about the war in the Middle East do."
0,Fresh,This is the closest exploitation cinema has come to capturing the hive-like buzz of online life in all its invasive intimacy.
0,Fresh,"[Grant] makes the romantic yearning palatable and moving in each scene he's in, and the result is both funny and poignant."
0,Fresh,Inspiring story of a boy's efforts to help homeless kids.
0,Fresh,"Sure, the film is silly -- really silly, but it's a whole lot of fun. Most of all, the characters are as likeable as they are funny, and the dialog is downright delicious."
0,Fresh,"A meticulously constructed depiction of modern alienation, from the great Abbas Kiarostami."
0,Fresh,"Fields tells most of his recollections in a dry and wry way with indignation, irreverance, cynicism and bemusement."
1,Rotten,There's not quite enough in here to justify a second sweep.
0,Fresh,"The Meg is undoubtedly dumb but it's a fun sort of dumb as most types of fun involving giant, murderous sharks tends to be."
0,Fresh,"Where Gran Torino fails at social criticism, it succeeds at capturing an engrossing snapshot of the human saga. If itâ(TM)s Clintâ(TM)s last film, itâ(TM)s a perfect ending."
0,Fresh,"It's impossible to keep the Simpsons down. Even during those draggy parts, you need to stay alert: You never know when the film's 11 credited screenwriters will unleash another zinger."
0,Fresh,"This has the same charm as Drafthouse's Miami Connection, only with jungle cats instead of drug-dealing ninjas."
1,Rotten,"Schroeder is sometimes able to disguise his contempt for the material and elevate it into something serviceable (like Single White Female). In Murder by Numbers, though, even Schroeder can't keep his own boredom from showing."
0,Fresh,I could not have asked for a better vehicle for Lin Shaye and her cinematic counterpart Elise Rainier to come full circle than Insidious: The Last Key.
0,Fresh,Full of effective sequences in search of a story. A big step down from Chapter One.
1,Rotten,"Blumberg juggles comedy and drama here before going predictably dark (as addict tales tend to do), but he's more circling his subject than nailing it down."
1,Rotten,"Like many children I've met, director Chris Columbus seems never to have heard the word no."
1,Rotten,Out Cold is destined to live on as a constant of late-night cable film.
0,Fresh,"Filmed over a period of three live performances of Stew's and Heidi Rodewald's popular Broadway musical, director Spike Lee beautifully captures the play's vibrant music and energetic physicality toward a priceless cinematic artifact."
1,Rotten,This film does for fairy tales what Time Bandits did for time travel stories
0,Fresh,"More enjoyable than Finding Dory, more clever than the overrated Zootopia, and more memorable than Moana, Sing is a real holiday treat."
1,Rotten,The film looks like one of those kaleidoscopes where you twist and turn it and look at all the pretty images.
0,Fresh,An enjoyable arts feature with its heart in the right place ...
0,Fresh,"For anyone who cares about the future of America, it's required viewing."
1,Rotten,"A slight, sleep-inducing ""comedy"" that plods so deliberately from gag to alleged gag that nothing comes as a surprise."
0,Fresh,"It's barely scary, but it's a treat for every boy (or girl) who'd hack off their right arm to hear Megan Fox purr: 'You've given me such a wettie.'"
1,Rotten,"Although the idea of a female adventurer (essentially a counterpart to Indiana Jones) sounds exploitable, the execution of her feats are incredibly pitiful."
0,Fresh,"Refreshingly free of heavy-handed scare tactics, this documentary calmly and rationally explores rising amphetamine use by asking thought-provoking questions and promoting thorough understanding."
0,Fresh,"Wild animals. Dead bodies. Rustling noises in the dark. With these minimalist elements, Benjamin casts a nerve-fraying spell, playing tricks on the audience."
0,Fresh,There's much to admire about Us.
0,Fresh,"While Backcountry is a completely different beast of a film, it should be admired for how well it pulls off such a familiar genre."
0,Fresh,"The real reason to see the film is the work of the Coens' regular collaborators, cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer Carter Burwell, who supply the visual and auditory landscapes that are True Grit's most notable achievement."
1,Rotten,"A genial, but increasingly absurd romantic drama."
1,Rotten,"If Bartkowiak can't make a good film, he should at least let his inner Ed Wood out to play more often."
0,Fresh,"What ultimately defines the film, though, what makes it unforgettable, is its tragic gravity."
0,Fresh,"Part Die Hard, part 24, with a dash of The West Wing, the action-thriller Olympus has Fallen asks you to suspend your disbelief."
0,Fresh,Hancock suggests new visual directions and emotional tonalities for pop. It's by far the most enjoyable big movie of the summer.
0,Fresh,"A gun-toting, ass-kicking Jamie Lee Curtis nudges a slight recommendation for cliched Halloween sequel."
1,Rotten,I found TinTin an unfulfilling experience at the movies.
0,Fresh,A tough film grounded in modern foreign policy that puts a face on those who are collateral damage in this war on terror.
0,Fresh,It might be one of the best movies that Marvel has ever produced.
1,Rotten,"Makes the original look like ""Casablanca"""
1,Rotten,"Vince Vaughn would make an excellent Willy Loman in a revival of Death of a Salesman. Here, he has the presence, charm, desperation and sense of yearning that characterise Arthur Miller's doomed anti-hero. Unfortunately, this is a very goofy comedy."
1,Rotten,"Seattle locales, some spry lines and tiny soundings of depth still leave us in the conceptual grip of 'love' as a system of endless bartering and vanity, with impulsive copulation treated as consecration. Oh, boy."
0,Fresh,22 July is a brave and careful film.
0,Fresh,"The Manchurian Candidate does a fine job of reviving the paranoid thriller genre in this engrossing tale of politics, corporate power and mind control."
1,Rotten,"Fleder attempts...to puff this picture up with quasi-intellectual hot air. But the truth is, Don't Say a Word is the kind of movie Hollywood makes on auto-pilot..."
1,Rotten,"With a minimally talented cast, it focuses on the most ludicrous, repulsive aspects: Paris Hilton, the slaughter and melting wax."
0,Fresh,"[Besson is] riffing on spy movies and their inherent double crosses and triple crosses, stopping just short of parody but letting the audience in on the trick. And thanks to Besson and a willing cast, the trick's a pretty good one."
1,Rotten,"I am glad that [Von Trier] exists, to decry our sins, but, with another sequel to come (Manderlay is the centerpiece of a trilogy), I am even gladder that he is one of a kind."
1,Rotten,"Director Mark Steven Johnson is infinitely less concerned with exploring Blaze's smoldering, soul-deprived isolation than he is infatuated with the character's skull-'n'-bones imagery."
1,Rotten,"There isn't an original thought in the entire film. If the script stinks, nothing or no one can save the movie."
0,Fresh,"Utilizando o sexo como ponte para estudar seus personagens, o diretor Wayne Wang cria um filme interessante, mas no totalmente satisfatrio."
0,Fresh,"The part of me that grew up reading sci-fi novels was tickled just enough, and the comedy was just (barely) funny enough, for me to recommend this."
0,Fresh,By far the best action movie of the year.
0,Fresh,"Nocturnal Animals has style and ambition to spare, yet as a whole Tom Ford's dark psychological thriller rings hollow."
0,Fresh,Song of the Sea is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. Yep. I will use that hyperbole.
0,Fresh,"Writer-director David Kittredge's spooky, ambitious thriller about the mysterious fate of a gay porn star is equal parts David Lynch, The Fluffer and 8mm."
0,Fresh,"[Farhadi] begins with a bang, his extended family wedding one of the most cinematically significant in some time, but oddly, his film suffers diminishing returns as skeletons start to tumble out of closets."
0,Fresh,"Lemmons, her extraordinary cast and gifted crew deliver laughing, crying and plenty of signifying."
1,Rotten,"Wasting a voice cast populated with recognisable names, this attempt to cash in on nostalgia for its source material evokes more bewilderment and boredom than excitement or wistful reminiscence."
0,Fresh,"Decorous to a fault, in the manner of middling Eric Rohmer talkfests, it's a film that could use some shaking up."
0,Fresh,"One of the hardest things to find to recommend to people is a good mainstream film, not aimed at children, that involves no violence or untimely death - this is a charming example of that rare breed, may they never become extinct."
1,Rotten,"What starts off as an intriguing coming-of-age story, ends up being a convoluted movie with too many characters having problems."
1,Rotten,The Happening is his first hilariously awful film.
0,Fresh,"Order, movement, sense: all become arbitrary, means by which the teller conveys and creates meaning."
1,Rotten,"Skyline packs some impressive money shots, however with its tracing-paper-thin script there's not enough propping up these whizz-bang set pieces."
1,Rotten,"Two hours' worth of painful stupidity, overt racism, and mind-battering noise and movement."
1,Rotten,It's grimly fascinating to watch fine actors wrestle with the increasingly awful screenplay.
0,Fresh,"Absurd? You betcha, but boy do director F Gary Gray and his cameramen handle the whole thing well."
0,Fresh,"Still going strong at the respective ages of 69 and 68, director Garry Marshall and his singing co-star Julie Andrews are the true royal couple of this straightforward sequel."
1,Rotten,"The movie seems to view any examination of its characters' motives, their working conditions or the consequences of their actions as a kind of betrayal."
0,Fresh,The result is a wonderfully dry and witty comedy which is pitch-perfect in tone.
0,Fresh,"When the movie ends, you'll definitely want to stay in your seat through the credits. I'll say no more."
0,Fresh,"At the center of the drama is Nicole Beharie, who inhabits her role as a woman unjustly maligned with intelligence, conviction and regal sense of pride."
0,Fresh,"The film foregrounds the absurdity of sexism while still using the same slapstick style of the first film. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. But, the attempt is refreshing."
0,Fresh,An enjoyable comedy that's held back by too many minutes and poor pacing in the middle.
0,Fresh,Control is a tremendous memorial.
0,Fresh,"Phenomenally acted, exquisitely scored, and ultimately moving."

0,Fresh,"We see a family at its best and at its worst, with the grumpy mealtime silences and the playful banter. Much of this is down to the first-rate performances from Elba and Marshall."
1,Rotten,"The arbitrary and generic plot points and devices in ""The Dark World"" - in which Thor must save the Nine Realms from destruction - are slippery from overuse."
0,Fresh,"Bonkers laugh... like a colourful, senses-pounding rush. The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out Of Water offers far more craziness than David Hasselhoff could in the first film."
1,Rotten,"Not diabolical enough for true black comedy, too scary and violent for kids lured by its PG rating and witless in its sendup of obsessive TV viewing, Stay Tuned is a picture with nothing for everybody."
0,Fresh,"It's both straight-faced spy film and sly spy spoof. That's a difficult balancing act, but director James Mangold exactly right."
0,Fresh,Satisfyingly entertaining.
1,Rotten,You'll wish this clunker was at ground zero.
0,Fresh,Melts Buñuel with Hitchcock. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"...a pretty good, aesthetically modest film [that has] suddenly become deeply affecting in ways its makers could never have predicted."
1,Rotten,"Meyer's teen bore-triangle has a mimetic quality, assuming the same degree of naval gazing self-interest as the target demographic."
1,Rotten,"Here Comes the Boom is slightly above average for this sort of broad comedy, but is hampered by too many significant issues to be worth a watch."
0,Fresh,Arguably the best in the franchise so far.
0,Fresh,"Full of songs from both Buckleys, the film, directed by Daniel Algrant, underplays the daddy-issue cliches while also staying away from a typical biopic structure- after all, it ends before Jeff Buckley even got famous."
0,Fresh,"Brady and Fleming, who co-wrote the script, build to a feverish finale, 15 minutes of pure transgressive laughter when Hamlet 2 is finally performed."
0,Fresh,The one scene of Lassie standing alone on the highlands of Scotland is worth the price of admission.
1,Rotten,"Is it scary? Creepy is more like it. ""Sinister"" makes you feel uneasy, lulls you into sleepy mode and then slaps you with a couple of cheap scares."
0,Fresh,"Gorgeous to look at and frequently quite compelling ... but, obviously, not without some big gaping flaws."
0,Fresh,"It is good that the film has charm, for after a certain point it doesn't necessarily have anything else."
0,Fresh,"Apart from the scenic location of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val and the equally enthralling shots of Indian and French cuisine, what remains is a pleasant if rather syrupy tale of clashing cultures."
0,Fresh,One of the most absurdly earnest exercises in paranoia you'll ever have the good fortune to see.
1,Rotten,"Frankly, if this flick is somebody's idea of ""pro-woman,"" my guess is that that certain ""somebody"" probably doesn't know all that many women."
0,Fresh,"Despite its terribly unimaginative title, Edge of Tomorrow is a surprisingly imaginative summer action movie."
0,Fresh,"It's weird, it's daring and it's different, which is why it works."
1,Rotten,"The journey is pretty bleak, rarely varies in tone and as for Ben, just as he struggles to relate to the world, how are we meant to relate to him?"
0,Fresh,Offers a thiought-provoking treatment of the mind-body problem.
0,Fresh,"Hail, Caesar! is a hoot, the Coen Brothers in their most PG Wodehouse mode."
0,Fresh,Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a visual masterpiece...
1,Rotten,"While Elvis' briefly startled face isn't precisely legible, your reading is pretty much ordained."
0,Fresh,"A sympathetic, deeply human view of figures whose usual cinematic function is to get thrashed by Chuck Norris."
0,Fresh,"For adults, it can get mushy and repetitious, though the overall sweetness and ingenuity shoveled into it makes you want to love the movie more than you're able."
0,Fresh,"Enhanced by a wicked sense of humor, Will Gluck's movie does what Hughes did best, showcasing characters with personality who make you wish you had them on speed dial."
1,Rotten,The script...is overwritten and forces its heavy-handed quirkiness on audiences through far-fetched scenarios that make no real attempt to feel like something logical characters would actually do.
0,Fresh,"A marvelous little unpacking of the meaning of happiness, precisely what constitutes it, and how to know whether you've found it."
0,Fresh,"Shazam!, a movie explicitly built around our childhood fascination with superheroes. One wonders how the franchise producers manage to make sense of it all."
0,Fresh,"The film bears the mark of a real directorial talent, eager to push the documentary form in inventive directions, just like Errol Morris and Werner Herzog, and for that alone, it deserves a nod of appreciation."
0,Fresh,"Has elements of legal thriller, political drama, academic throwdown and scientific geek-out."
1,Rotten,Failure to Launch arrives pre-told by design. But even those coming in cold will know what's going to happen one step ahead.
0,Fresh,"[A] delicious romp with a game heroine that never takes itself too seriously, and has some pointed things to say about the class system."
0,Fresh,"The film is rich in brilliant oddities and juxtapositions, never more so than when Duvall and Spacek are encompassed in the same frame."
0,Fresh,"...it does seem entirely likely that even those who've never heard of [Tobolowsky] will inevitably find themselves won over by the actor's warm, irresistibly inviting persona."
0,Fresh,"Despite it's faults, it's definitely worth a looksee."
1,Rotten,Faris's Marilyn Monroe-inspired breathy delivery feels forced and gets old fast. Only the scene-stealing Emma Stone shows any promise.
1,Rotten,The best thing about the film is its truly heroic Pakistani teenager heroine and the few unrehearsed glimpses we get of her.
0,Fresh,"Sin Nombre is at once subtle and intense, familiar but refreshing, intimate even as it tells a story untold numbers have endured."
1,Rotten,And the director's Oscar-winning daughter? Never did I ever think she could ever be so annoying.
1,Rotten,"The Twilight Saga is an obvious target for parody, but this crude and unfunny movie makes a hash of it."
1,Rotten,Presented with a surface politeness that renders it all but passionless.
1,Rotten,"Jaglom's concentrated approach serves up some insight to be sure, but the movie states its case in the first 10 minutes and then proceeds to run out of things to say, almost as quickly as the women in this movie think they've run out of things to wear."
0,Fresh,"Not a cellphone in sight, just people living in the moment, Amazing Grace is an infectious concert film that celebrates the Queen of Soul."
0,Fresh,"Wendy and Lucy is a film of small details and unassuming craftsmanship. It may be too slight for some, but if you let it get under your skin, it packs a devastating emotional coda."
1,Rotten,"Bride Wars could have been a clever, incisive satire of the bloated and maddening wedding industry; unfortunately it takes an old-fashioned stance far out of place in this modern world."
0,Fresh,"A wonderfully crafted and thrilling treatment of the story, one that never gets too preachy or overzealous"
0,Fresh,"It's voyeuristic, unbelievable and often shocking as it delivers surprises, twists and many elements of interest, including an effective depiction of the times during the sexual revolution"
0,Fresh,Every note brings us closer to these characters.
0,Fresh,"Great, grungy, energetic story, eclipsed only by the sequel."
0,Fresh,The Proposition becomes a riveting exercise in bad faith and murderous justice that takes far more than an eye for an eye.
1,Rotten,Rent Dangerous Liaisons and save yourself the trouble.
1,Rotten,"The jokes are obvious and tend towards the scatological. The rambling dialogue also makes this an endurance test. Year One, Audience Enjoyment Nil."
1,Rotten,"I wanted to really like this movie, but the laughs largely weren't there and the ultimate spiral of the movie attempted to rely on ""shocking"" dialogue and situations rather than actually pushing the envelope."
0,Fresh,"Though Saints and Soldiers' examination of faith, self-sacrifice and morality is not groundbreaking, it always holds our interest."
1,Rotten,"If the way a movie looks is everything to you, this film will pass the test. I, myself, prefer feeling involved."
0,Fresh,"As an unsure father, [George Clooney's] more down to earth than he's been allowed to be in years."
0,Fresh,It's hard to imagine anyone else capturing the essence of Gone Girl quite like David Fincher does.
1,Rotten,Noah is the first film in Aronofsky's body of work to feel unmistakably watered down.
0,Fresh,"The unspoken message of the film is that war is a battle of competing symbols and ideologies that have no meaning. We create artificial divisions to hide the fact that we are all the same under the skin, with the same hopes, desires and fears."
1,Rotten,"It just bounces Brody back and forth in time and yanks us around, and around, and around."
0,Fresh,Taxi gets its power from its lack of hysteria.
0,Fresh,I think what works best about this final film is how surprisingly moving parts of it are.
1,Rotten,"The movie is clearly aimed at kids, but is this really the kind of stuff we should be filling their brains with?"
1,Rotten,"Partisan hokum...a disgraceful use of art as a weapon. Even if a movie is entertaining and technically well made, if it's touting a lie it's not praiseworthy."
1,Rotten,The folly lies in the fact that Marlowe is a definitive 1940's character who does not transplant well into other eras and climes.
0,Fresh,"A corking conspiracy lies at the heart of Chad Gracia's debut documentary, whose darkly comic proceedings are strewn with covert recordings and animated interludes."
0,Fresh,Come to Daddy is a frenzied thriller pouring out Tarantino quarts of gore and laughs.
0,Fresh,Provides a pleasant evening in the theater.
0,Fresh,Irresistible wish fulfillment.
0,Fresh,It is aimed at kids and as far as I could tell it pleased the kid audience - so adults will just have to grin and bear it.
0,Fresh,"Though well-acted by Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn, this second version of Lillian Hellman's play about the malice of lies is not as powerful as the first, in 1936, also helmed by William Wyler."
0,Fresh,"Comes across as a less contemplative, more motion-driven version of its predecessor, The Da Vinci Code."
1,Rotten,Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year.
0,Fresh,"An odd and attractive adventure, with a notable ability to to fictionalize at the same time that it's concerned with historical reconstruction. [Full Review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,"The setup to this haunted bayou tale isn't particularly exceptional, but the finale is eerie and downright fascinating."
0,Fresh,Stylish and intelligent.
0,Fresh,"For those Muppet fans fearing the last film was a fluke, no need to worry at all as even Statler and Waldorf wouldn't be able to find much to complain about with this immensely satisfying installment."
1,Rotten,"Henson, in a role that could easily have degenerated into an angry-black-woman caricature, is better than the material deserves."
0,Fresh,"Hosoda has a gift for making us truly care about and empathize with his young characters...whether we're inside his head or not, we're always in Kun's heart."
0,Fresh,"Fans of risky, avant-garde independent fare with biting humor and unsettling insight will remember this audacious oddity for a long, long time."
1,Rotten,Don't let the big names fool you: The Code is limp enough a thriller to deserve the direct-to-video treatment it's received.
0,Fresh,"There's a certain kind of cinema that produces an effect in the viewer that's close to embarrassment. Not because its shoddy, boring or stupid but because it seems so true to our waking existence."
1,Rotten,Plays out like a sitcom version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
0,Fresh,"The most interesting moments, however, belong not to the chef but to those who labor in his shadow."
0,Fresh,"It's a steady, solid film that gets the job done. If you can ride out the slow, action-deprived stretches, you might come away with similar opinions."
0,Fresh,Intelligent and moving.
1,Rotten,The very idea of ghost in a metallic shell talks of a surreal irony. A deep concept that vanishes in Hollywood's ambition to carve out a franchise.
1,Rotten,"While the premise certainly makes it stand out from the sea of dysfunctional family dramas, a cute idea alone doesn't quite cut it."
0,Fresh,"It is a great film in its own right thanks to terrific direction, subtle performances and the best soundtrack of the year so far."
0,Fresh,Is it shoehorned into an already-spiraling series? Oh yeah. Yet Annabelle Comes Home manages to be one of the most effective films in the franchise.
1,Rotten,"'If nature abhors a vacuum, how come Affleck hasn't been struck by lightning yet?'"
1,Rotten,"Junkerman's dull film, and its important if inflammatory message, will bore all but Chomsky's fellow travelers to death."
1,Rotten,"Its witty humor and repartee [has] mostly [been] taken away, leaving only crass, unfunny lines that at the most inspire a chuckle."

0,Fresh,The Fly is almost unique for a horror movie in that it compels us sympathize with and root for the characters.
0,Fresh,"A clockwork wedding cake, a caper movie sprinkled with pixie dust, a picture that sends you scrambling for clever metaphors and failing to find them."
0,Fresh,Not to be missed.
0,Fresh,This comedy offers plenty to savor for foodies and romcom fans alike.
1,Rotten,"Over-directed, confused, badly-acted, poorly scripted trash."

0,Fresh,"With ""Pavarotti,"" director Ron Howard serves up a straightforward documentary about the great tenor's life and career."
0,Fresh,An appetizing fusion of diverse influences.
0,Fresh,"Reign Over Me closes with, at best, a cautious hope, leaving us more anxious than when we went in, and throughout the film there is a stunned and bewildered air hanging over the city, like a heavy smog."
0,Fresh,"Sorvino and Kudrow have so much fun doing their parts, their enjoyment spreads to the audience."
0,Fresh,"Darling's fragility was no secret, which gives even the movie's comical moments an underlying poignancy."
1,Rotten,"The movie turns into something strange and annoying, an attempted blend of a suburban thriller with an Old West shoot-'em-up."
0,Fresh,The great charm of Lukas Moodysson's We Are the Best! lies in its total lack of pretension and adult editorializing.
1,Rotten,The screenplay hangs a lampshade on the trope of people who are stuck in time.
0,Fresh,"It's all done with tremendous style and backed by exceptional performances. Jude Law and Paul Newman are both brilliant and chilling, but the real revelation is Tom Hanks."
1,Rotten,Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie.
0,Fresh,"The film's plot rarely makes sense and the script is lackluster, but who cares when each chase is composed of the right amount of speed and clarity? Lin never puts his foot on the break until the last possible second."
1,Rotten,...there's exceedingly little here to hold the interest of even the most patient adult.
0,Fresh,"This is Grade ""B"" Stephen King with nothing-special special effects. There is only one shocking monster-face and no creepy-crawlies."
0,Fresh,One of Louis Malle's finest early films.
0,Fresh,"Stone could have been some sort of a procedural, a straightforward crime movie, but it's too complex for that. It is actually interested in the minds of these characters, and how they react to a dangerous situation."
1,Rotten,Really nothing more than an elongated situation comedy with a strong dose of political correctness...sappy and dramatically confused.
0,Fresh,"A splendid film, my favorite Woody Allen movie in a long time. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"It's the kind of sly, witty independent gem that rolls through every few years, lighting up crowds and forcing men to admit they were wrong when they thought they were being dragged to another chick flick."
1,Rotten,"...feels like a retread of so many films that have come before it, ""Divergent"" by way of ""Pleasantville"" topped off with ""Citizen Kane's"" talismanic Rosebud."
0,Fresh,"I... grovel at the feet of Joaquin Phoenix, with whom I've always been a little in love and to whom I now must pledge myself completely."
0,Fresh,The Forest [is] a decent horror movie that offers plenty of shriek-worthy moments. But its more interesting aspects are the repressed guilt and sorrow at its core.
1,Rotten,So uneven it's downright schizophrenic.
0,Fresh,"Jennifer Lawrence is engaging as Katniss; indifferent to the circumstances and determined to survive, you end up admiring her spunk and defiance to The Man."
1,Rotten,"Not only is the premise devoid of any ingenuity, it ignores the teasing hints of the grounds for a sequel offered in the first film."
0,Fresh,Benji shines in another simple but engrossing dog tale.
1,Rotten,"War was ever a Kubrick-ian hell-ride, futile, fundamentally unheroic and de-humanising, but now it's mocked by a mad multimedia accompaniment innocent of all real ethical, moral and humanitarian value."

0,Fresh,Engaging but overstuffed ...
0,Fresh,"Yolande Moreau's Seraphine, all doughy and unreadable at first, lets you see how the passion that enriches her work might also upend her life."
0,Fresh,The movie is a tangible and violent abstraction of a broken and inconsolable mind. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,A breathtakingly magical animated fable that lifts your spirits and carries you away to a world far beyond your wildest imagination.
1,Rotten,"not unlike the event from which it takes its title. Some of it rekindles memories of what worked in the past in a nostalgic, even sweet way. Some of it reminds one what they liked about these people in the first place. Some of it is just sad."
1,Rotten,"I'm probably getting awfully moralistic, but couldn't the geniuses who devise entertainment for tots have come up with something a bit more, uh, responsible?"
1,Rotten,The film is trading cheaply and knowingly on former glories when it should be concentrating on a story which in truth does not have much comic value in the first place.
0,Fresh,"Thanks to casting and chemistry, this is the first great romantic comedy of the summer."
1,Rotten,"The explosion essentially ruined -- or, rather, overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me."
1,Rotten,"Every time you think there's a limit to their stupidity and bad decisions, you're proven wrong. It gets worse."
0,Fresh,"In those moments when we (and the characters) are paralyzed between bad decisions, we're as stiff with tension as an icicle."
1,Rotten,A plodding western interested more in a study of two brothers than in providing real adventure.
0,Fresh,"The saving notes are the film's minutiae. There are dialogue moments in Payne's drollest, enemies-on-edge style."
0,Fresh,"Zhang Yimou returns to form with this visually resplendent combination of martial-arts epic, intimate character study, and compelling historical drama."
0,Fresh,"A programmer that once upon a time would have played on the bottom half of double bills, Anacondas has no pretensions and gets its little job done effectively, providing some small-scale laughs and chills for the late summer season."
1,Rotten,"... after surviving Constantine, I definitely prefer the trip to hell [Keanu Reeves] took in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey."
0,Fresh,"...a metaphor for obsessive filmmaking and the film industry's penchant for devouring its own talent...a sly, often funny, yet affectionate send-up of the genre."
1,Rotten,"Andrew Neel's Goat wants to be a shocking expos of fraternity hazing, but it undercuts itself at every step."
1,Rotten,You take The Towering Inferno mix it with Die Hard and you set it in Hong Kong just to give everybody some xenophobia... and you combine those three things and then you just make it as dumb as you possibly can... you get [Skyscraper].
1,Rotten,"Momentum has plenty of visual flash, but the script is deeply dumb."
1,Rotten,"If the movie's action recalls video games, the dramatically artificial lighting suggests 1980s rock videos. Indeed, Rise of an Empire is so campy that it might work better as a musical."
0,Fresh,an amazing story
1,Rotten,"""Louder Than Words"" goes out of its way, and almost takes pride in, eschewing actual heartfelt emotions-so much so that, by the end, it is hard to even care."
0,Fresh,Kurosawa's first domestic drama is music to general audience's ears.
0,Fresh,"The fans will (designer) label ""Sex and the City"" a hit this weekend."
1,Rotten,Its a collection of scenes where stuff happens but not a real movie. The first Iron Man proved it could be smart AND entertaining. This is just mildly ok in parts.
0,Fresh,"Offers impressive visuals, engaging action scenes and funny moments."
1,Rotten,"This psychological thriller does have a few effective moments. However, it goes a little further - too far, in fact. There are some sexually explicit moments in this that would likely garner an NC-17 rating had it been submitted to the U.S. ratings board."
1,Rotten,"Every moment of When We First Met could not be more painfully obvious, and that might be forgivable if there were an ounce of humor, a dose of charm, or a decent character in the entire film."
0,Fresh,"One of the great pleasures of this movie is the way it takes the physical properties of the real world as a starting point for a wildly, hilarious and fantastically silly extravaganza."
0,Fresh,An important film that will change nothing.
0,Fresh,An unexpectedly stirring first feature by Kyle Patrick Alvarez about the challenges of making human connections in the weird and wired 21st century.
0,Fresh,"Nothing in an Oliver Stone movie is ever subtle, and this one is no exception. But Kitsch, rebounding from two flops that were hardly his fault (John Carter, Battleship), proves his mettle with a tight-wound, fine-tuned performance."
0,Fresh,Shakespeare in Love crackles with the in-jokey brilliance that we associate with the playwright Tom Stoppard.... And you don't have to be a Shakespeare scholar to appreciate this movie's wit and easygoing references to the entertainment world today.
1,Rotten,"A spare drama of unlikely mentorship that makes good use of its two actors' talents and rapport, but ultimately comes off as a self-conscious collection of grimy, fringe-dwelling 'types.'"
0,Fresh,"Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer's chemistry is worth it alone, but the added 60s flair just sweetens the deal."
0,Fresh,"Extraction's centerpiece is undoubtedly a prolonged, single-take shot that's nothing short of mind-blowing in terms of its audacity and effectiveness."
0,Fresh,How can such a predictable movie be so damn refreshing?
0,Fresh,"Even the most cynical, jaded, seen-it-all-before critic cannot deny certain visceral reactions to a film. Lights Out gave me the chills."
1,Rotten,"The movie claims to be only 83 minutes long, but it's the longest 83 minutes to come along in quite awhile."
0,Fresh,"Technically, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is another towering achievement for New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson."
1,Rotten,"...the film's tedium is such that by the time the final credits rolled, I felt much sorrier for myself than I did for [Faris]."
0,Fresh,"[A] tense and propulsive thriller with several vital, provocatively rendered thoughts on its seething mind."
0,Fresh,Filmmaker Lee delivers a somewhat overlong yet mostly engrossing drama...
1,Rotten,"So, yet again, Hollywood's elite has produced a political tract that plays fast and loose with history from an empty-headed, politically correct perspective."
1,Rotten,"Reasonably smart and sometimes funny -- right up until the end, when it sells out its intelligence in favor of a standard-issue dose of overwrought violence."
0,Fresh,"In a sense, it's the ultimate ""Florida Man"" story."
1,Rotten,Spielberg trades in his usually powerful ideals for an unsettling combination of phony humanism and pandering realism.

0,Fresh,"Guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook, rattled, or rolled."
0,Fresh,"Men in Black: International is that exact kind of blockbuster that's fun while you're watching it, but quickly shows its flaws once you actually think about it."
0,Fresh,The film knows how to play with the expressive dichotomies while developing its survival adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Technically, Somebody is a disaster."
0,Fresh,"It works great as a comedy, but not so great as a drama."
1,Rotten,"For a formulaic comedy about shallow, shopping-obsessed teenagers, it's about twice as good as it has any right to be."
1,Rotten,Passably speedy on the level of other TV retreads that seem miscast on the big screen.
0,Fresh,"Storytelling like the kind found in Little Woods, no matter how many times a narrative is reinvented, can always feel fresh when it's nurtured by the right hands."
0,Fresh,"Zemeckis' movie may lack the emotional impact of the 1951 British version of A Christmas Carol, starring Alastair Sim as a truly transformed and happy Scrooge. Nevertheless, it's a visual treat that respects and artfully enhances its source."
0,Fresh,"Something easy on the senses, ""Made in Italy"" is approachable, with some genuine humor and concern for its characters as they confront old business with fresh eyes."
1,Rotten,This Mother Teresa biopic offers Hallmark Channel-grade inspiration of the most sluggish sort.
0,Fresh,"A masterly effort, more fully-realized, emotionally mature, and cinematically inventive than just about anything else out there."
0,Fresh,A children's film that manages to be feelgood but never too cutesy.

0,Fresh,"[Gloria Swanson] proves that in the years she has been off the screen she has lost none of her glamour, the magnetism that made her an outstanding personality of the early Hollywood days."
0,Fresh,"Overly simplistic and not terribly hard-hitting, but worth recommending for the unflattering mirror it dares to place before the government in charge."
0,Fresh,Who cares if Purple Rain is silly?
1,Rotten,"Actually, not as bad as the reviews say; still ""solidly average"" does not a red tomato buy."
1,Rotten,Never mind that the film is never scary; it also is never much *fun*.

0,Fresh,"Black Panther doesn't just hit its marks. It leaves marks. Landmarks. So get in the queue now, people."
1,Rotten,"All the sentiments about 'being all you can be' fall somewhat flat against the cynically commercial feel of StreetDance 2's enterprise, which credits the audience with one brain-cell each."
0,Fresh,"Even though the story is utterly preposterous and silly, the cast takes it as seriously as they can, which helps carry the film as an audience-pleasing button-pusher."
0,Fresh,The movie takes advantage of classic themes. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"While the first Hotel Trans had humour for both younger and older audiences, this one will likely fall short in its appeal to adults, although there's plenty for the little monsters to enjoy."
0,Fresh,"One of the most fascinating films of the year, and it deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary."
0,Fresh,"Whedon has pulled off an impressive feat here, sustaining the intensity of a ripping adventure yarn while digging into a few of the characters a little more deeply, finding fresh ground to cover in a more satisfying epic."
0,Fresh,Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lynn Collins are so interesting that it's easy to put up with the decision-making dithering that goes along with the title.

0,Fresh,Handsomely animated adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic.
0,Fresh,Those who enjoyed flying on dragons in 3D in AVATAR can do it again. The plot is overly familiar but still effective.
0,Fresh,"On it's own it's entertaining. As a sequel, it's dissapointing."
1,Rotten,"Hews to the Sequel Curve (first one good, the rest increasingly mediocre)."
0,Fresh,"Here is a unique fright flick that sets out to terrify and does it to capacity, eschewing fangs and claws to find chills and thrills in the unquenchable evil of human madness."
1,Rotten,"Stop me if you've heard this one. A priest, an altar boy, two Crusaders, and a con artist walk toward an abbey with a suspected witch in tow."
0,Fresh,"The Childhood of a Leader owes big to its young star Tom Sweet. As a wide eyed, bratty kid, his brave performance alone will cause a string of nature vs nurture debates..."
0,Fresh,"Too ludicrous to take seriously, yet too po-faced to laugh at, it sacrifices wit and energy for intensity."
0,Fresh,"It's not better than or funnier than ""Thor: Ragnarok. But it has some great laughs and Lang's relationship with his daughter may be the most meaningful father-daughter relationship in the MCU outside Hank and Hope Van Dyne."
0,Fresh,"Elegant and haunting, using simple elements like camera placement and blocking to maximize the eeriness."
0,Fresh,Serves as a corrective to all those fluffy period movies where pretty costumes and set design function as the cinematic equivalent of a bubble bath.
1,Rotten,There's just not quite enough before the showpiece to make it memorable as a whole.
0,Fresh,"The Little Hours is sure to offend the sensibilities of the most pious and Catholic of viewers, but this wasn't really a film made for them anyway."
0,Fresh,"Overall, the acting is pretty solid..., but what really takes Girl on the Third Floor to the next level (pun intended!) is the fantastic array of practical effects."
1,Rotten,Dismisses context in favor of bizarre sights and sounds. Directors Maurizio Benazzo and Nick Day seem awed by their surroundings to the point of paralysis.
1,Rotten,"It's a sports movie for masochistic, vainglorious athletes."
0,Fresh,Even at two hours - an eternity for a doc - the movie never feels too long.
0,Fresh,"A smart, authentic and impressively acted entry into a genre that so rarely does justice to young women, Booksmart marks a striking debut for director Olivia Wilde."
0,Fresh,"In many ways Red Letter Day is a humour heavy, daylight spin on The Purge, one which works well, but could benefit from a longer run time."
0,Fresh,Even better than the similarly themed Treasure Planet. Kids will enjoy it.
0,Fresh,"Where the original Guardians felt fresh, Vol. 2 now feels familiar -- sometimes pleasantly so and sometimes not."
1,Rotten,"Far too often, African Cats feels episodic in its structure. Rather than featuring a driving, compelling narrative, it's: cheetah vs. gazelle. And then: hyena vs. cheetah. And then: lion vs. crocodile. Who will win???"
0,Fresh,"Crowe doesn't add much to the general discussion, but he's assembled an attractive cast and seems to have a genuine affection for the young people on the screen."
1,Rotten,"Maybe it's too early to say MacFarlane can't make a movie. He's still young, he's compulsively creative. He'll keep getting more chances. He could figure it out, but I don't think I want to watch him try."
0,Fresh,At its best it feels like spending time with some comfortable old friends.
1,Rotten,I think I could have had more fun at Disneyland waiting on long lines with noisy uncontrollable tykes running all around me.

1,Rotten,"As for the movie, the makers of Casablanca can sleep peacefully. Come to think of it, so can the makers of Ernest Scared Stupid."
1,Rotten,Neil LaBute -- who never met a story he couldn't turn into a paranoid castration fantasy -- dumbs things down enough to insult the stupid.
1,Rotten,The biggest problem with the film version is material that shuts out a core part of its potential audience.
0,Fresh,"I'm not going to shout this film from the rooftops as being great, but after Apocalypse Resident Evil: Extinction was a pleasant surprise."
0,Fresh,"Nobody does grumpy better than Paul Giamatti. And to be fair, how could they? The guy looks like the result of a steamy affair between Tim Curry and an onion."

1,Rotten,"How Uwe Boll manages to scrape together enough investment money to give wing to this type of overblown, amateurish gibberish is truly a mystery of the cosmos..."
0,Fresh,Director Mikael Hafstrom demonstrates a sure hand with the material and is definitely a talent to keep an eye on.
0,Fresh,It's less of a white savior trope than a story of a white American who realizes that China is super awesome.

1,Rotten,"For better or worse, Valkyrie brings to mind that classic line from The Producers' ""Springtime for Hitler"" musical number: ""Don't be stupid; be a smarty. Come and join the Nazi party!"""
0,Fresh,"What do you get when you put two of Hollywood's worst actresses, Beyonce Knowles and Ali Larter in the same movie? A surprisingly decent little paint by the numbers thriller."

0,Fresh,Pixar's spin on the fantasy genre shows the studio once again nailing their signature blend of comedy and pathos.
0,Fresh,... unfolds with a refreshing honesty and a sense of surprise to it; being handled more like something embedded within the characters rather than a plot point thrown in just to bring up an issue or an easy conflict point.
0,Fresh,"Infinity War is a great time, the kind of movie-going experience that even non-fans should be able to enjoy on a purely visceral level, but it's hard not to feel cheated."
1,Rotten,Just another forgettable disaster flick.
1,Rotten,"The film's final unforgivable fault is its sheer, plodding dullness."
1,Rotten,"For once, the trailer for a new comedy didn't spoil the best bits. Unfortunately, that's because there aren't any."
1,Rotten,"While it delivers a few good laughs, the film is short on drama and suspense."
1,Rotten,"A plodding, play-it-safe rendition of The Family Feud."
0,Fresh,"Unclassifiable, ultimately gripping 1962 film about a Sicilian native who discovers he can't resist the corrupting power of what The Godfather would later dub 'this Sicilian thing.'"
0,Fresh,"""Red Sparrow"" is an entertaining espionage film that works because of its candid and cynical worldview ... unfortunately (Red Sparrow is) attempting to portray the exploitation by the villains from an exploitative perspective."
0,Fresh,"Bigger, Stronger, Faster* left me convinced that the steroid scandals will abate as the drugs are reluctantly accepted as inevitable products of a continuing revolution in biotechnology."

1,Rotten,"Esteemed Brazilian director Walter Salles (""The Motorcycle Diaries"") falls flat on his face on his first Hollywood outing with a horror movie that will bore you to tears."
0,Fresh,"A Late Quartet is visually and musically rich. But above all there are the performances, individually and as an ensemble, and they're pitch perfect."
0,Fresh,"The film truly belongs to Ejiofor, whose big, soulful eyes seem to register so many things at once: Shock, pain, grit, determination, abject despair at times, cautious hope at others - and always, dignity."
1,Rotten,A Jaws ripoff no less ludicrous than Orca-Killer Whale... not only silly but narratively muddy and visually murky.
1,Rotten,"It feels like a film walking in the shoes of its predecessor with a slightly sassier spring in its step. But at a certain point in the final act, this remake seems to forget why we're all watching."
0,Fresh,"I imagine most people seeing ""Ruby Sparks"" will consider it to be about a writer and his fictional creation. There may be another way to approach it."
0,Fresh,"As captured by LaChappelle, krumping is indeed compulsively watchable. But as packaged the experience of watching it falls short of being meaningful."
0,Fresh,I liked Hidden Figures so much I went back to see it again. And I liked it just as much the second time.
0,Fresh,"The Messenger involves difficult subject matter, but it's not hard to watch. It's sad and sobering, but also humorous and touching at turns."
1,Rotten,"It's all a bit anonymous despite engaging performances, especially from Yuan as the sunny optimist, but the character of Jorge is so cripplingly introverted that there's nothing to latch on to."
1,Rotten,"But even by the rather lofty modern standards of cynical, pointless cash-ins, Joe Dirt 2 is pronounced, a sequel to a mild hit from nearly 15 years ago that even its most ardent defenders would be hard-pressed to justify"
1,Rotten,"It makes the world of Frozen feel infinite, even if the characters and the story make it feel like it's a small world after all. Perhaps I should just let it go."
0,Fresh,Being haunted by one's past really means something from director Conor McPherson
0,Fresh,"Creating a gritty backstory for a 12-year-old can't have been easy, but director Joe Wright pulls it off with great aplomb, making it one of the most entertaining visits to Neverland so far."
1,Rotten,"Seems to be constructed strictly as a go-for-broke cinematic thrill ride, a sort of demo for the latest and most spectacular visual effects available from Hollywood. It feels like overkill."
1,Rotten,Neeson's better than this.
1,Rotten,"McConaughey and Parker try, but they can't save a premise as insipid as this one."
1,Rotten,The script rings false from the off.
0,Fresh,"The genre humor is clever and the supporting characters are mostly entertaining, while the anti-violence themes are universally relevant."

1,Rotten,The Broadway Melody has not stood the test of time in ways that many of its more artistic contemporaries have.
1,Rotten,"Where King of Thieves fails its heralded cast is in its shifts in tone. We're promised a fun ride with Caine in the driver's seat, but the trip goes downhill too quickly."

1,Rotten,"Thankfully, Prom Night's predictable ending doesn't suggest a remake of the original's 1987 sequel, Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night 2. No kidding, that's what it was called."
0,Fresh,"A stream of subconsciousness work of art, Eraserhead is Lynch's most surreal film. Packed with grotesque physical deformity and quest for spiritual purity, the film flaunts eerie sound and brilliant imagery."

0,Fresh,'A solid crime story.'
0,Fresh,"Filming largely in Panama with substantial support from the government, writer-director Jonathan Jakubowicz works to tie Duran's popularity with that country's struggle for respect and self-determination in the last half-century."
1,Rotten,"The characters have little depth, serving mostly as vehicles for odd bits of philosophy."
1,Rotten,"This isn't really a movie. It's a collection of covers. And if it's possible to have a decent time, you can't help but be struck by the emptiness of it all."

0,Fresh,Elissa Down's semi-autobiographical film always manages to counter its indie clichés with a sober sense of the volatility that comes from living with an autistic individual.
0,Fresh,"Craig's working-class, grim Bond is compelling, and ""Skyfall"" tries to give, in its third act, some insight into how he got that way."
1,Rotten,Starts to play like dada.
1,Rotten,Cage plays Gates way too broadly and crudely; I half expected him to break into his patented Elvis impersonation.
1,Rotten,The movie includes little of Seuss' language and even less of his wit.

0,Fresh,Maclean has made a Western of such confident ease that it's hard to believe this is the director's first feature film.
1,Rotten,"The cast perform strongly, especially the charismatic Drameh and Charlie Creed-Miles as a cabbie trying to adopt a child, but the material lets them down; a melodramatic climax is particularly embarrassing."
0,Fresh,"As a personality, Lloyd is a combination of silly and sweet, but his true star power comes from his daring athleticism."
0,Fresh,Jim Carrey's latest is a perfectly pleasant if predictable picture about a part-time pop who learns his priorites after receiving a package of penguins.
1,Rotten,"An unconvincing attempt at an old-fashioned western, Seraphim Falls works best as a chase thriller but falls apart when it tries to harness the mythic power of the American frontier."
1,Rotten,"Theron has the greater range, but you'll wish it had been applied to more worthwhile material."
1,Rotten,"To be fair: the motocross, parachute, BASE jumping, and rock-climbing sequences in Point Break are absolutely worth the price of admission... Less charming is everything else."
1,Rotten,The major mistake Carrey made was agreeing to do the movie in the first place.

1,Rotten,"Maybe this title is to Jackie Chan as Moonraker was to James Bond, an extravagant attempt to imitate the box office fare of its time, which only highlighted the throwback quality of the central character. It's a ""jump the shark"" moment."
0,Fresh,A hilariously badass '80s throwback that continually shifts gears and keeps you guessing to the very end
1,Rotten,"The Safety of Objects doesn't expose nearly enough of the pre-traumatic to make before distinguishable from after. So the film leaves you dissatisfied, as though you'd just spent two hours with a menagerie of plastic white people."
0,Fresh,Dreamgirls opened on Xmas day and it was every much of a brilliant holiday movie. I guess the only complaint I have is it is too slick.
1,Rotten,"Faced with a choice of blunt instruments with which to beat a good book into a bad movie, director Billy Bob Thornton chooses heavy, random, arty imagery and a leaden pace."
1,Rotten,"An unreal film about a real situation, unavoidably cartoonish, as was the earlier Tears of the Sun, in its attempt to join crucial issues to ridiculous melodrama."
0,Fresh,Damon has never been better!
1,Rotten,"The film, based in name only on a series of South Korean graphic novels, has nice, washed-out desert exteriors and some cool jet-powered motorcycles, but there's nothing in the hackneyed story or the derivative action scenes to make you take notice."
0,Fresh,"The film is not just a wrenching history lesson about how easily riven a nation can become. It is also a moving tale about the struggle of Rwandans to stitch their country back together, to find a way to forgive as well as ask forgiveness."
1,Rotten,"At one point Amanda remarks, 'In the world of love, cheating is not acceptable.' Also no longer acceptable: romantic comedies set in 'the world of love.'"
0,Fresh,The wonderful American director Kelly Reichardt seems to have been made for short stories.
1,Rotten,"Given that we've seen this story before and didn't like it then, Safelight should perhaps just be called ""safe""."
0,Fresh,"The story promises action, but this brooding martial-arts adventure from Hou Hsiao-hsien is largely a pictorial experience."
1,Rotten,Far more fun when it was called Taken.

0,Fresh,A delightfully twisted piece of cinematic fluff.
1,Rotten,"Transformers: The Last Knight is a rusty, rotting heap of scrap metal. It's Michael Bay venturing into the most self-indulgent, the most conceited corners of his psyche."
0,Fresh,A black comedy without the comedy.
0,Fresh,"In what Rowan Atkinson has called his last feature outing as the childish accidental prankster ""Mr. Bean,"" this bookend sequel to ""Bean"" (1997) is a highly enjoyable family comedy for every unadorned moment of Mr. Atkinson's comic genius."

1,Rotten,"Johnson doubtless planned to deliver a hand-wringing thriller filled with unexpected twists and turns, but even good intentions can find themselves caught in the line of fire."
0,Fresh,"68 Kill is a horror-comedy-action thrill ride, one that goes for insane and then amps up the volume on that way past 11."
0,Fresh,"The visuals are superb, the voice cast is top-notch, and it's fun to revisit old friends, even if their patter feels a little too familiar."
0,Fresh,"Hoffman's performance is beyond words, as always, but it is Phoenix's take on the animalistic nature of man that speaks volumes to the core elements of what makes the film such a devastating one to shake."
1,Rotten,"Shutter Island is a surface movie without even much surface; it's awash in stale ideas and character actors like Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley who show up every 20 minutes to give us some handy exposition, and then leave."
1,Rotten,"At the very least, it is a complete waste of time."
1,Rotten,An overheated melodrama that plays like an art-house version of the gloriously awful Wild Orchid.
0,Fresh,A beautiful little chamber dramedy about four sharply-drawn characters played with a very lovely mixture of nuance and showmanship.
0,Fresh,The version of Domino that is being released is a thriller that will many will find to confusing and lethargically paced - and there's some validity to those complaints - but the film is still a journey through a number of De Palma's cinematic obsessions.
0,Fresh,"[It's] as much of a personal Scorsese picture as Raging Bull or Taxi Driver. In some ways, this could be his most heartfelt movie."
1,Rotten,"Here, it is the premise that is extraordinary, while the characters are mainly perambulating theories."
1,Rotten,"The relationship between the real-life Paisley and McGuinness is undoubtedly a fascinating subject and one worthy of examining on film, but The Journey sadly does little justice to its interesting source material."

0,Fresh,"Another fine document of American life at an astonishingly strange point in its history. Sadly the film fails to answer its own questions, despite its most impressive and moving moments appearing to offer something of a solution."
0,Fresh,The core performance of Amandla Stenberg is dope...you felt the emotions she was going through.
0,Fresh,"It does what it does quite capably ... maintaining a muscular, splattery propulsion that never descends into campily excessive gore or any other silliness despite the occasional flat line and plausibility lapse."
1,Rotten,"A moralistic ending is telegraphed from the beginning and routinely fulfilled by the end, rendering the rest of this trite, visually unappealing mess virtually worthless."
0,Fresh,"A frolicsome adventure for kids that celebrates diversity, facing one's fears, and relying on each other in troubled times."

0,Fresh,"A chilling, eerie cautionary tale about the ghosts that continue to haunt Poland long after the war."
0,Fresh,"Evocateur is an excellent effort that tries to make sense of a complicated person. It's both highly complimentary and critical, the kind of balanced overview Downey rarely gave those who came under this show business spell."
0,Fresh,"The climb itself is incredibly intense. Cameraman Mikey Schaefer, on the ground, can't bear to look at the more dangerous parts of the climb. For a vertigo-inducing look at a really dangerous climb, Free Solo is a real rush."

0,Fresh,"Solid, straightforward and touching."
0,Fresh,"Based on Cassavetes pere script, this Cassavetes fils meditation on love and madness is a truly curioisity item, lacking the master's profound ideas and rich subtext; 20 years ago, it would have starred Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara and Peter Falk."

0,Fresh,"It's as effective in 2009 as it was upon its initial release, and the richness of its tapestry, densely woven from human emotions and character interaction, ensure it will never lose that relevance."
0,Fresh,"The movie's writer-director, Richard Shepard, balances the macabre and the sentimental, and understands that although his film contains questions like 'don't successful people always live with blood on their hands?' its real subject is friendship."
1,Rotten,Bring on those Razzie nominations.
0,Fresh,"Birds of Prey emancipate itself from its predecessors, and exceeds them in every way. With a new director in Cathy Yan, and a new feminist vision, it makes a splash as a standalone film but gives hope for the future of DC and other comic book movies."
0,Fresh,"When I wasn't charmed by the characters, I was transported by the film's playfulness. The camera bobs and weaves around like a jazz instrument. It's not content to simply film the content. It has to react to it as well."
1,Rotten,The whole is less than the sum of its parts; it never actually coalesces into a movie.
1,Rotten,It's fun to watch and yet its soul is vacuous and empty.
1,Rotten,...a misguided and thoroughly pointless piece of work.

1,Rotten,"Channeling the reluctant hero persona, The Ballad of Lefty Brown doesn't so much break new ground as try to push the tropes."
0,Fresh,"Where Casualties of War had the swooning formal elegance of an opium dream, Redacted adopts the fractured fitfulness of a seizure."
1,Rotten,"Like some deformed offspring that's been walled up in an attic for 20 years, this resurrects the spirit of Police Academy."
0,Fresh,This willfully eccentric tale about teenage boys in suburban Ohio fleeing their families to live in the deep woods plays like an erratic comic revue slapped together at theater camp.
0,Fresh,"This is a movie of extremes: alternately dazzling and deadening, careening between stylish and stultifying, tough going on occasion and smooth sailing the rest of the way. Yet in the final count, it's the virtues that save this Vice."
0,Fresh,"This is one small corner of a portrait, magnified to the extreme. If you do happen to find this product user-friendly, it will be due to the aptly intuitive design of Fassbender's excellent performance in the title role."
0,Fresh,"""Wolverine"" has zip for depth, but since it never sold itself as such, who cares? This is the action movie the advertising campaign promised, and Hood comes through with plenty of scenes that satisfy on a visceral level."
1,Rotten,It doesn't possess the serious edge necessary to effectively realize the source material's formidable warrior (nor does it stay faithful to the origins and conquests).

0,Fresh,Widows is a heist movie with a mind and a voice and a total lack of fear in using both.
1,Rotten,"I guess you can't blame Ford for being bored during most of this, but it's too bad the fact is so painfully apparent throughout the movie."
0,Fresh,"I'm grateful for movies that truly want to entertain, rather than drown the audience with special effects and marketing gimmicks."
1,Rotten,Evans works so hard to look like a drug addict that it undermines the character's effort not to look like one.

0,Fresh,The big payoff of Central Intelligence lies in the comic chemistry between Hart and Johnson.

0,Fresh,"An admirable and fairly engaging little adaptation of ""The Jungle Book"" tale that may find the most truck with tween-y Young Adult readers who want a little bit more bite and realism in their narratives."
1,Rotten,A pseudo-bio pic that is little more than a vehicle to shock and tittilate.
1,Rotten,"It's a thoughtless, cancerous, viral, irresponsible pollution whose existence speaks ill of the society that produced it and of any society that would endorse or defend it."
0,Fresh,After a slow start Noé's self-referential soap proves more-ish.
0,Fresh,"The film's a monument to single-mindedness and self-belief, a screwball comedy without the jokes (though there are terrific one-liners)."
0,Fresh,This is such a fine psychological thriller that there are several scenes that make you jump out of your skin. There's even a fine homage to one of Hitchcock's most famous scenes. This is a film not to be missed.
1,Rotten,"Slow, has zero inventive kills or any set pieces for that matter, is constantly tripping over its own narrative and, worst of all, it isn't scary."
0,Fresh,"You would think a movie packed with scenes like ""Redford repairs a hole in a boat,"" ""Redford inventories supplies"" and ""Redford eats some beans out of a can"" would make for tedious viewing, and yet I was transfixed."
0,Fresh,"A stirring, brutal and sad examination of the bleak cycle of violence and pain."
1,Rotten,"Butter is laid on too thick, and in other places it's spread too thin, and it never quite develops a flavor of its own."
0,Fresh,"Somewhere deep down, I think we all hope that God turns out to be like George Burns."
1,Rotten,"Fans of Hoon will thrill to all of this footage. For others, it'll be a pretty tough haul."
0,Fresh,"No one talks like this in real life, and certainly not all the members of any group, but it is fun to listen to, and eminently quotable."
1,Rotten,"This is pretty silly stuff, even for a children's movie, and it sort of sells out the one original point the series used to have: Here was a prehistoric adventure that refused to go the yabba-dabbo-do route."
0,Fresh,"More than a loving, clever riff on a fable, Chicken Little is a grade-school primer on the language of movies with a capital M."
1,Rotten,A lacklustre and clich-ridden Danish crime sequel.
1,Rotten,"Mostly the problem is that every aspect of The Giver feels both painfully familiar and like an awkward, unsupportable stretch."
0,Fresh,"Spielberg fights mightily to keep that randomness under control, and usually succeeds. He's made a good movie. But the malleability of the story prevents it from being something more."
1,Rotten,"...bad in more than just an everyday, sure-does-suck kind of way."
0,Fresh,"Insomnia director Erik Skoldbjaerg knows his '70s conspiracy thrillers backwards. As a result, Pioneer delivers insidious, shadowy tension."
0,Fresh,The love-hate relationship between student and teacher are all captured with splendid accuracy.
0,Fresh,A genuine tale of redemption.
1,Rotten,"In one scene, co-star Christopher Walken is very clearly reading from cue cards."
0,Fresh,"This is easily Burton's finest work, and while he takes some liberties with Lewis Carroll's classic, there are plenty of traditional ""Alice"" traits to satisfy everyone."
0,Fresh,Michael Fassbender will be in every best actor conversation from now until Oscar night (and deservedly so) for his mesmerizing turn as the legendary and legendarily difficult visionary Jobs.
0,Fresh,"If the setting of ""The Guilty"" couldn't be simpler, its immaculate execution by first-time director Gustav Möller couldn't be more gripping and involving."
1,Rotten,"Humorless to a paralyzing extent, this joyless effort illustrates how a bad-on-paper idea can turn into something cringe-inducing onscreen."
0,Fresh,"Has a taut script, good doses of twisting suspense, plenty of first-rate supporting players and one nuclear explosion that strikes eerily close to home -- in more ways than one."
0,Fresh,Even a film like Detroit-centered on a moment from hell and the real story of the harrowing death of several young Black people-can make you feel more powerful because the film privileges the Black perspective and is unflinching about our reality.
0,Fresh,"Evoking memories of 'Cinema Paradiso,' it's a gem - one of those rare films that truly touch your heart."
0,Fresh,"Stephenson is too close to it all; he's never able to truly dig below the cult flick's frenzy, to examine the very real pain of both the film's makers and the audience that takes rabid, gleeful delight in their folly."
1,Rotten,It takes a folk tale rife with culturally rich and specifically scary possibilities and flattens it out into a thoroughly by-the-numbers haunting flick.
0,Fresh,"Of all the bravura visual effects in Martin Scorsese's dazzlingly stylish Casino, it's a glimpse of ordinary people that delivers the greatest jolt."
0,Fresh,"Last Flag Flying is a terrific film that allows no self-righteousness from anyone. It's about war veterans in a way we need now. It isn't just a moving entertainment for its audience, it's a kind of redemption for it as well."
0,Fresh,Allows his significance to register and his charisma to shine despite a pedestrian approach that's especially awkward in its use of archival footage.
1,Rotten,A movie that wafts in and out of clarity like a wavering transmission.
1,Rotten,"Never quite rises to the level of self-conscious parody, but merely replicates the same old stereotypes."
1,Rotten,"Substitute 1940s fighters for spaceships, move them closer to Earth, and you have the audience appeal of this movie."
0,Fresh,This is the most confident and bold kind of filmmaking.
0,Fresh,"While hardly an all-inclusive look at this complex conflict, paints a heartfelt, fairly restrained picture of a nation under siege."
0,Fresh,"[Blu-ray Review] Classy and icky, atmospheric and chilling, ""Clown"" astutely plays into the unknown mystique coulrophobia is made of. Highly recommended."
0,Fresh,Kodachrome's transformation from good to great is triggered by a third act that packs an astonishingly powerful and emotional punch...
1,Rotten,I'm still clawing out my eyes.
0,Fresh,"With a cast this capable and a screenplay invested in unusual topics for comedic dissection, the feature does just fine as a platform for David to continue his career quest to perfect the art of unease."
0,Fresh,"McDonagh has a way of exploring guilt and redemption, family and purpose, in ways that I'm not sure have quite crossed the screen before."
0,Fresh,Arrival is about the awakening and ensuing trauma discovering that we're not alone in the universe.
0,Fresh,An Old Testament bellow of ferocity and pain that seduces us on so many levels you'd swear you could see the fourth wall tumbling down around our ears.
0,Fresh,"It's an unshowy, quietly intense drama with grace notes in every scene -- and a hellish punch."
1,Rotten,Incredibly lush animation can't disguise a tone-deaf story in director Zack Snyder's foray into animation.
0,Fresh,"This elegant, beautiful, sad film explores an old story in an emotionally violently new way."
0,Fresh,To share Feuerzeig's loving investigation is to share an insightful study of the destructive and creative capabilities of the mind.
1,Rotten,The disappointing truth is that director David Bowers and the script deserve fail grades for their shambolic efforts.
0,Fresh,A strange but cool comedy.
0,Fresh,"The wonderful cast manages to find nuggets of laughter, hope and sadness in a story about the notion that being older doesn't mean you lose your zest for life.  "
0,Fresh,"Generic but not uninteresting, with a good performance from Leto."
1,Rotten,The latest in a string of adequate if uninspired action disaster movies fronted by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.
1,Rotten,"For a film about love and witches, Beautiful Creatures is a passionless experience, surprisingly devoid of actual movie magic."
0,Fresh,The twists of the story are still gripping and director Robert Stone does a solid job of assembling the information for a moviegoing generation to whom the mid-'70s are ancient history.
1,Rotten,"Uma boa fotografia e atuações competentes (especialmente da pequena Boyd) não são o bastante para que ignoremos o roteiro longo e sem foco que, além de investir em um deslocado tom sobrenatural, ainda conta um desfecho fraquíssimo."
0,Fresh,"Blood Diamond takes its title from jewels sold to fund murder and mayhem in conflict zones. Yet it's not a message movie but an old-fashioned, entertaining action adventure that contains messages."
0,Fresh,Bumblebee is a surprisingly enjoyable ride for a franchise that felt like it'd long since rusted over.
1,Rotten,A period art-house romance that's drunk on sentimentality and sun-touched panoramas of the countryside ...
0,Fresh,"Beautifully edited with never-before seen clips from the Depression, WWI, WWII, Vietnam to show how Robert McNamara changed from a hawk to a dove."
0,Fresh,If there's a unifying concept to all of this it's the idea of defilement.
0,Fresh,"A nicely entertaining and relatively intelligent bit of cinematic paranoia, but it almost crashes spectacularly upon landing."
1,Rotten,"Technical marvel without emotional grounding is masturbatory special effect self-congratulations. I don't want to care how many hairs on Bagheera's head move. I want to care what's inside his head. But, hey, that's just the bare necessities for me."
0,Fresh,A relentlessly-grim reminder of how the world simply watched when it would have been so easy to put an end to the madness.
0,Fresh,"'Taken 2' is ridiculous, but at least Liam Neeson knows it."
1,Rotten,"Gorgeous scenes along the Cornish coast are impressive, but the film lacks the dynamic chemistry between lovers that's so important in a romance-themed movie."
1,Rotten,A waste of celluloid.
0,Fresh,"A film of great power and integrity, fiercely attentive to the tipping point of progress and the difficult decisions that push it forward."
0,Fresh,"Still Alice is accurate and compassionate, and anyone who has known someone with Alzheimer's will appreciate the film's sincere intentions."
0,Fresh,Creepy '90s thriller about murderous kid has violence.
0,Fresh,"What makes the comedy work is that Bateman doesn't relent. Guy is, simply, a loathsome person."
0,Fresh,"Faithful to the bestselling novel on which it's based, The Kite Runner is a thoughtful, often heart-wrenching story about betrayal and redemption."
0,Fresh,Trump would gleefully cite Riz among his examples of immigrants who turn to crime in the U.S.
1,Rotten,Whatever we found with Nemo and his determined dad seems to have been lost or forgotten in this fishy tale.
0,Fresh,"""Resistance"" is a gripping thriller with a very unique main character at its core. Jesse Eisenberg, a watchable actor who shines at performing a quiet nervousness, is excellent as Marcel."
0,Fresh,"Furious 7 is basically a live action version of Grand Theft Auto, with a touching tribute to its fallen star - Paul Walker."
1,Rotten,"Ted 2, is everything about the first film recycled, less effective, and entirely forgettable."
0,Fresh,"Despite the lack of innovation in the narrative, Chow has delivered a slick and polished production that holds the attention and satisfies far more convincingly than either of the writer and director's previous collaborations."
0,Fresh,"Its slight pleasures are more indicative of Gil Kenan's plea for time off from Movie Jail for good behavior than his directorial skills. However, he brings impish, effective efficiency to a remake that works modestly on its own single-serving terms."
1,Rotten,"Disappointing, often violent sequel is for series fans only."
0,Fresh,"It joins the very short list of intriguing experiments in 21st-century 3-D, which otherwise comprises Werner Herzog's ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"" and Wim Wenders' ""Pina."""
0,Fresh,"Overflowing with deep characters in compelling relationships, rich with the always-timely message about bigotry and acceptance, and... delivers more action and excitement than in the first round."
0,Fresh,"Isn't Tony Stark/Iron Man, stumping for 'a suit of armor around the world,' basically a combination Klaatu/Gort, endorsing the plan for an Earth-patrolling fascist robot army proposed by the alien visitor in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'?"
0,Fresh,"In between the exciting sequences of the team setting up equipment and being nearly captured, The Cove includes interviews with persuasive sea life experts and not-so-convincing local Japanese authorities."
1,Rotten,"At this point, looking to juice the series with action scenes is the equivalent of applying a defibrillator to a cadaver."
1,Rotten,"When a celebrity chef like Rodriguez is just going through the motions, we can smell that the grindhouse fad is way past its expiration date. It's time to put a fork in it."
1,Rotten,"Humorless, rote, clichéd, and entirely unsurprising. Antoine Fuqua attempts to recapture old Hollywood magic - and fails - rather than create his own."
0,Fresh,"It was Hawks' genius to recognize a kinship between his leads, and to understand that the 'naturalism' of the Wayne persona was as deep and complex as the more intellectualized approach of the neurotic young New York stage actor, Clift."
0,Fresh,"Quite possibly the best picture of the year thus far, with no fewer than three of the most luminous female performances I have ever seen onscreen."
1,Rotten,"When you're dealing with [many films], you know it's just Hollywood junk... 21 Grams aspired to be more, which makes its failure that much more disappointing."
0,Fresh,"""Spotlight"" is terrific... and certainly ranks as one of the best films of the year!"
0,Fresh,A film for the ages.
1,Rotten,"A strangely oblivious film, one that undercuts its story with exactly the sort of praise-hungriness that its hero learns to overcome."
1,Rotten,"It's actually Thornton's amusing performance that makes the first half of this silly film watchable. After that, Ben Stiller comes along to do a painfully unfunny supporting bit and pretty much sucks all the remaining funny out of the movie."
0,Fresh,"Ms. Fisher is brainy and salty and hilarious, and she's frank and eloquent in describing being bipolar."
1,Rotten,The best-looking bad superhero movie of the year.
0,Fresh,"An edgy, intellectual and enigmatic dream-like metaphysical thriller about living in post-reunification contemporary German as a venture capitalist."
0,Fresh,"From a giant's point of view - or atop the beanstalk, if you're a pesky human - the big picture is good fun."
0,Fresh,"Not a total mess, but it's more of the same. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,This atmospheric and elaborately knotted tale is wrapped in a pretext that is more preposterous than mysterious and not very involving.
1,Rotten,"The problem with the film, mostly, is that it's overstuffed with historical incidents that don't really cohere into a convincing story beyond the usual rise-fall-rebirth stuff."
1,Rotten,"In a script filled with bad dialogue, one line actually broke me up: ""When science messes the bed, I'm the guy they call to change the sheets."" In that case, to quote The Rock, this movie is a ""500-pound bag of monkey crap."""
0,Fresh,Burt Lancaster plays the role with a newfound subtlety and restraint.
1,Rotten,"Men, I ask you this question: can a film where both Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger appear naked be a downer? The answer is yes, surprisingly."
0,Fresh,"Despite occasional platitudes from director and doctor Ryan McGarry, the film makes an angry, urgent plea for reform to a health-care system that's still critically infirm."
0,Fresh,"The story is simply so incredible, and it's presented in such an interestingly old-fashioned way, that it's hard to leave the theater feeling less than inspired."
0,Fresh,"Would end up being a very dark movie indeed if it didn't have Duncan-Smith at its center, determined to think her way out of a set-up that is stacked so heavily against her that time travel changes only the victims, but not the violence."
1,Rotten,"A decade on, this largely routine reboot from British director Neil Marshall...is no compensation for whatever we missed out on back then."
0,Fresh,"For anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke, Ram Dass: Fierce Grace is worth seeking out."
0,Fresh,Here is the archetypal clash between the establishment forces of morality and the creative spirit of a subversive artist.
0,Fresh,"Berardini's doc vigorously proves that despite their marketing, Tasers are not the answer. They are only means to a bigger, deadlier problem."
0,Fresh,"An empathetic, often heartbreaking piece of work."
0,Fresh,Needs to be seen.
0,Fresh,"A smart comedy for adults, Baby Mama is a consistently funny pleasure, filled with charismatic performances and a nicely understated emotional element."
0,Fresh,"Davies' quiet, painterly film largely eschews musical cues that would heighten its emotional impact, but as it is, ""Sunset Song"" is captivating in its sincerity."
0,Fresh,"It confirms Mr. Kramer as the versatile man he is, full of object lessons for the world; this time a forceful one about the right to think."
0,Fresh,"Even if the accents are questionable or inconsistent, there's still a sense of place and geography that's rare in contemporary American film. This is the county-sized world of a parolee, where everything seems small except the horizon."
0,Fresh,A fractured American family that's bracingly honest and relatable.
1,Rotten,"...uried in clichs and swarms of mutant-like bats who, at a distance, look like nothing more than inkblots with hidden agendas."
0,Fresh,"Kendrick and Wilson have the right kind of sass to entertain; they may not be as glamorous as the kids in Glee, but in Pitch Perfect, they seem like the girls who are having all the fun."
0,Fresh,A passable yet underwhelming thriller...
1,Rotten,"Overplayed: there are entirely too many beaming smiles and emotional flip-outs...the only reason to see this movie is Foster, whose overplaying somehow succeeds at charming where her costars fail. [Blu-Ray]"
1,Rotten,Shannon should have made Roscoe P. Coltrane noises the whole time.
1,Rotten,Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline.
0,Fresh,"This isn't one of Burton's best, but it has zealous energy."
1,Rotten,"""Never Say Never"" is about as revealing as a Canadian snowmobile suit."
0,Fresh,"An austere rural landscape, festering hatred, class tensions, terse dialogue -- these are common currency in indie movies these days. Shotgun Stories uses them all, but manages to stand out from the crowd."
0,Fresh,Una cinta tierna y emocionante por momentos...pero no termina por convencer.
1,Rotten,"Along comes Marlon Wayans to do in A Haunted House what he once did in Scary Movie. And do it much, much worse."
1,Rotten,It's hard to get a date when you won't stop talking about yourself even though you don't have much to say.
