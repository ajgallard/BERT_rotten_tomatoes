1,Rotten,"Beyond a nod to fracking and the clash between aborigines and Westerners, Yolanda Ramke and Ben Howling hardly bring anything new to the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"J.J. Abrams takes this warm concept and turns it into an impersonal sci-fi thriller, capsized by an increasing overload of digital effects."
1,Rotten,Ultimately flatlines on its own ideas.
0,Fresh,A kinetic musical extravaganza that proved to detractors there was more to the Beatles than mop-tops and melodic pop hooks.
1,Rotten,"If silent, black and white films were something lots of people wanted to see, they'd still be making them. They aren't because most people don't. They are pass and their appeal is strictly esoteric."
0,Fresh,"Mann has become a master builder of sequences, the opposite of the contemporary action directors who produce a brutally meaningless whirl of movement."
1,Rotten,It also exchanges the police subplot that gave the earlier film its steady pace for a lot of pointless backstory about the mother-fixated stalker.
1,Rotten,Signing Tim Burton as director was a textbook example of a great idea on page...
0,Fresh,"An intoxicating blend of sex, mystery, and violence about an indelible character you'll find it difficult to forget-but would probably prefer never to meet in real life."
1,Rotten,"It's a gross parody of its original. And since the original was a gross parody to begin with, the whole thing begins to seem gaseous, overbright, hideously inflated, as if all the bodily function jokes were about to belch it right off the screen."
0,Fresh,"If it isn't half as good -- or as funny -- as its forerunners, it maintains its integrity as a small, sweet-natured comedy that refuses to obey the commercial dictates of Hollywood by allowing its characters to determine their own zany destinies."
0,Fresh,"Stumbles a little, loosening its grip in the bromantic final stretch. But if impenitent heartstring pluckage is what you're after, this is where it's at."
1,Rotten,"Mostly the movie barrels toward you, stiff-armed."
0,Fresh,"This is a thorough and respectful documentary - Cannon Films undeniably taught Hollywood a lesson through bad example, but whether they were ahead of their time or shysters is left open."
1,Rotten,...Red Joan ultimately falls well short of its potential.
0,Fresh,Reworks A Matter of Life and Death with elements of It's a Wonderful Life and shares techniques and themes with Christopher Nolan's Inception.
0,Fresh,"You will not see another movie like The Death of Dick Long this year, or perhaps ever."
1,Rotten,The use of real Maasai warriors and location shooting in South Africa increases the authenticity of the production.
0,Fresh,"I had more fun with it than I didn't, which is more than I can say about a lot of these big budget event movies."
0,Fresh,"More than any other franchise, this looks and sounds like a comic-book brought to life."
0,Fresh,"A deliciously bittersweet family comedy from Noah Baumbach, this is very much a talkie from the Woody Allen school."
0,Fresh,"Ratzinger and Bergoglio clash, but they also bond over pizza; they have disagreements, but they also dance the tango; they argue, but they wouldn't dream of watching the World Cup final with anyone but each other. They're men of God, but they're men."
0,Fresh,"Audiard deserves to once again be applauded for the way he takes melodramatic convention and bends it to his own particular sensibility, delivering a powerful tale about the reminders we all carry of the pains that have formed us."
1,Rotten,"Lead couple Lily (Loren Horsley) and Jarrod (Jemaine Clement) are such unoriginal, checklist misfits that there's little about them to celebrate or even stomach."
0,Fresh,"Beautifully shot, elegantly acted melodrama of the sailboating cure for what ails you."
0,Fresh,Teens will go crazy over this film about star crossed lovers trying to bridge the gap between humans and vampires
0,Fresh,"Colourful and well-paced except for a cloyingly sweet song or two, the kids will enjoy this one."
0,Fresh,"Director Sydney Pollack has crafted a sad but fascinating film, based on the novel by Warren Adler."
0,Fresh,"When Do We Eat? takes place before, during and after a Passover Seder. But you don't have to be Jewish to savor this light and enjoyable comedy."
0,Fresh,"""My Father Die"" is a trashy jewel. As with the Rubens painting of Saturn devouring one of his sons that punctuates certain scenes, you kind of can't stop looking at it."
0,Fresh,It's reasonably entertaining fare for non-fans.
0,Fresh,This movie is fuuuuuuuuuun!! See it!
1,Rotten,It's not Renner's fault the script is a heap of dung.
1,Rotten,The problem is that this is a Sicario that wants to be a Logan.
1,Rotten,"The filmmakers do a lot of winking and rib poking; they sell ""Deadpool"" so hard that you might wonder if Marvel has started to pay on commission."
0,Fresh,"With the Kings of Tampa back together and on the road to a male-stripper convention in Myrtle Beach, Magic Mike XXL is the all-out man-party audiences wanted the first movie to be."
0,Fresh,"If you're wanting something nasty that may make you feel like you need a shower afterwards, then check this out. It's solid."
0,Fresh,"Byrne, easily one of the most talented comic actors of our age, shines here. It's a thoroughly delightful performance, one that gives Juliet, Naked a jolt of comic energy."
1,Rotten,Exactly what you expect
0,Fresh,"In spite of its attention-grabbing opening and provocative title, Free Angela And All Political Prisoners is less a work of agitprop than straightforward history, intriguing but never unsettling."
1,Rotten,It is your run-of-the mill period drama that plays it safe - certainly not daring enough to offend or to truly captivate.
1,Rotten,"Making yet again the mistake that more is more, director Barry Levinson piles on the concepts with such increasing rapidity that clarity takes a back seat to spectacle, and believability is stretched to the breaking point."
0,Fresh,"""Law Abiding Citizen"" is a sizzling hot thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."
0,Fresh,Ridley Scott retells an old story
0,Fresh,[Carnahan] directs with enough energy and style to hide the fact that his movie is nothing more than a little home invasion/ sodomy/ torture-type stuff.
1,Rotten,"Not to get on Gordon Gekko's bad side or anything, but Greed isn't good."
1,Rotten,Howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a Buuel retrospective.
1,Rotten,"King's film is a boffo short wantonly stretched to feature-length, well beyond the scope of his ideas..."
1,Rotten,An incoherent mess. Almost like JJ went to finish off a trilogy that he left in the middle of. At least die-hard fans will enjoy the fan service.
0,Fresh,"Shifting emotional gears with the adroitness of a Formula One driver, Bening delivers a diamond of a performance - multifaceted, sparkling and flawless."
0,Fresh,"Beauty and the Beast marries visual spectacle and sumptuous design work with a better story than its original, casting a spell on old fans and newcomers alike."
1,Rotten,"I was offered a ring of movie matrimony, but it was less than a perfect fit"
1,Rotten,A horribly failed satire that should be avoided by all.
0,Fresh,"If you had seen [Assassination Nation] at 15, it would have changed your life. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,'Pacific Rim' delivers the goods without firing on all cylinders
0,Fresh,"Some great, great meta-humor...the movie itself is very good as well."
0,Fresh,The 18 cameras Scorsese and his award-winning team of cinematographers employed to cover every angle of the event have captured tons of little personal moments and blown them up to IMAX-size proportions.
0,Fresh,"Rian Johnson, writer and director of this film, took my Star Wars reveries and served them back to me with vast improvements."
0,Fresh,An all-around fun movie for kids.
1,Rotten,"The fact that the apartment set seems so stagebound, there's almost no pretense of pretending we're not on a set, makes the movie quite hollow and canned."
0,Fresh,"Mixing a stately pace with bursts of raw violence and blunt eroticism, Lust, Caution indeed deftly blends those two attitudes."
0,Fresh,The funniest dirty joke you'll ever hear.
1,Rotten,"Remember how CNN ran this story into the ground, as it were? Eastwood does that here, draining whatever suspense that remains in a story for which we know the happy ending."
0,Fresh,"Kightley, West and Gough all give fine performances in this film, along with the supporting actors. Writer-director Wash Westmorland ('Still Alice') smoothly navigates this sprawling story, while keeping the focus where it belongs, on Colette."
0,Fresh,"An effed-up funhouse. Rogen, a livewire satirist, dishes out an R-rated cartoon treat that tackles the crisis in the Middle East, the nonexistence of God and the sex lives of supermarket products."
0,Fresh,"Bell's film captures the spectrum of emotions here: Abbie's desire for more as well as her fear, her parents' need to protect her as well as their wish to set her free."
0,Fresh,What's nice about 'Terminator: Dark Fate' is you don't have to rewatch the original first two. The film catches you up to speed in a clear and concise way.
1,Rotten,"Too long on slick, too short on magic."
1,Rotten,"Judging by the looks of Todd Phillips' tired Starsky and Hutch, it appears that 70s nostalgia has finally run its course."
0,Fresh,"From the exhilarating pre-credits sequence, against the backdrop of the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico City, to a spectacular denouement in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament, Spectre is a proper joyride of a James Bond film."
0,Fresh,"In Blast From the Past, Brendan Fraser certainly fits in the title role. He's a blast -- goofy, wide-eyed and romantic, continuing his impeccable streak of making OK movies (including this one) far more watchable than they should be."
1,Rotten,"If Moses was in the theater, he'd stand up ... and demand, 'Let these people go.'"
0,Fresh,Rip-roaring entertainment!
1,Rotten,Why is this gloriously schlocky premise treated with such ponderous solemnity?
0,Fresh,"Cool, fast, smart and sleek. It's also a surprisingly deep and almost painful reminder of the importance of a real social network - as opposed to, say, Facebook."
0,Fresh,It's the Inception of rom-coms. Sort of.
0,Fresh,This challenging police-procedural docudrama is worth watching closely and taking seriously.
1,Rotten,"Mark Friedman cover all the bases, but good intentions aside, it's hard to recommend such a thin, cliched fictionalization when so many good documentaries -- The War Tapes, The Ground Truth -- feature the voices of actual soldiers."
1,Rotten,"If you're already a pre-teen fan, you'll love this flick. Chaperoning parents will just have to grin and bear it."
0,Fresh,Emotional and intimate.
0,Fresh,"Come to Daddy is this bizarre thriller that makes you laugh out loud, cringe on more than one occasion, and strings its audience along this sad, beautiful, and often gruesome enigmatic tale that is really about a father and his son at its core."
1,Rotten,"It's probably a little bit better than Planes, with a far more engaging third act and prettier scenery throughout."
0,Fresh,"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is almost always inspired in the moment. The story team has a good idea that worked in the first film and gives us more of that, in a much bigger playing field."
1,Rotten,This movie pulls all its punches.
1,Rotten,"Instead of improving on the Disney animation experience, El Dorado proves to be inferior in every way."
1,Rotten,"Mirror Mirror is an aesthetically fantastical yet ultimately tedious film that may occasionally please the tots in the audience. However, it will leave adults far less enchanted."
1,Rotten,The material is too slight to make much of an impact outside the target demographic.
0,Fresh,Makes up in razzle-dazzle what it lacks in intelligence.
0,Fresh,"A frigid hothouse in four acts and one epilogue, the equal of the best of Losey or Duras"
0,Fresh,"Somewhere on the way to the future, America decided that it's better to have a houseful of designer wear and home entertainment gadgets galore, than good schools, affordable health care, and a job and home for everyone. Or did they?"
1,Rotten,"The movie equivalent of a mean girls' game whose only goal is the humiliation of its protagonist, for your entertainment. Also: a failed parable of the twistedness of the 1 percent."
0,Fresh,Rarely is a film about the supernatural as thoughtful and affecting as Intacto; even more rarely does that kind of film attract an audience.
0,Fresh,MAY is a very nasty and disturbing little horror film that the viewer will probably either love or hate. It is very unpleasant see and at the same time mesmerizing.
1,Rotten,"The plot wouldn't pass muster as an episode of a CBBC drama, but its various twists and turns and grotesque emotional idiocies are engineered through some of the most wooden dialogue I've ever heard."
1,Rotten,"After an hour, you begin to realise the irony of Neil Simon winning awards for Outstanding Writing ..."
0,Fresh,"There is a degree of outrage [in] the movie, but there is no passion in that outrage...the characters had it but the movie didn't."
0,Fresh,"Stitched together from spare bits of other, often better films,[it]stumbles awkwardly in story and plot, shuffling toward the predictable explosions and fireballs of the third act. Yet...Oblivion is so beautiful to look at."
0,Fresh,"By turns melancholy, witty, brutal, and sensual, the film is distinguished by its artful weave of time and memory, and by Everett's uncompromising performance as Wilde during his final years."
1,Rotten,"As filtered through screenwriter Philip Railsback's pen, Kearns' extraordinary life is rendered...well, ordinary."
0,Fresh,"The Diary of a Teenage Girl is an honest, tender and daring debut for its director, with a brave performance from its young leading actress."
1,Rotten,"If SKYFALL had hints of Mamet, SPECTRE has heaping servings of Bay with slightly more interesting location shoots."
0,Fresh,"Howard hustles and flows and keeps the flick afloat, despite the heavy undertow of total predictability."
0,Fresh,"It's an old-fashioned formula, but it still works well enough."
1,Rotten,A provocative but crass slavery drama.
1,Rotten,Gary Smith wrote about Radio in Sports Illustrated. Now Hollywood is up with Mike Rich doing the script and Ed Harris as a composite coach trying to keep the tear-jerking below flood level. They fail.
0,Fresh,Compellingly taut and existentially thoughtful.
1,Rotten,"I feel compelled to apologize about laughing at Chuck and Larry, like many Sandler films less a movie than a fistful of funny moments."
0,Fresh,There are plenty of honest laughs.
1,Rotten,Peppermint finds time to be both deeply offensive and wholly unimpressive. Quite a combination.
1,Rotten,The outcome of the film is predetermined by the formulaic scripts of Rocky II and Rocky III. Stallone boxed himself into a corner with this one.
1,Rotten,"We Are Marshall is not a bad movie; it is a potentially nice, familiar movie unfortunately marred by the unspeakably awful performance of Matthew McConaughey."
0,Fresh,"A soul-crushing weight rests upon Lorna (Dobroshi), the Albanian-immigrant heroine of the Dardenne brothers' stunning proletarian character study."
0,Fresh,Zhangke Jia's wife and muse Tao Zhao excels as plucky scam artist and femme fatale in film noir set against a changing 21st century China.
0,Fresh,An inspiring and uplifting documentary about a man who gives all he's got and experiences a miracle in return.
0,Fresh,A Hard Day's Night perfectly encapsulates the rash of Beatlemania that was exploding onto the world stage and making its way across the pond to America.
1,Rotten,"Spain never looked lovelier, but the banal romances of the lightweight principals in this retooled vehicle make the trip wholly unnecessary."
0,Fresh,"The Spanish Prisoner offers tension, eloquence and characters which will stop and make you think."
0,Fresh,The result is the best British comedy in years.
0,Fresh,"It's Spielberg with the message turned off, a jaunty two hours and 20 minutes that returns the director to his first love: blissfully pure cinematic fun."
0,Fresh,A meditative and visually stunning overview of the plight of refugees around the world.
1,Rotten,"An extension of the 300 universe, like an add-on content pack for a video game."
0,Fresh,Just scruffy enough to get by.
1,Rotten,The screenplay feels repetitive and very restrained. [full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"With Snowden, Stone seems fresh outta crazy. Too bad, because a pop of his patented lunacy would've helped."
1,Rotten,"with the retelling of legends, aspects of the story are emphasized or smothered in reaction to the temper of the times, that this one eschews politics for romance and spectacle is no more or less valid than earlier versions, just far less well told."
1,Rotten,"Essentially Risky Business for the 21st century, and I don't mean that as a compliment."
1,Rotten,"Everything Must Go is not a comedy as imagined by most Will Ferrell fans, it instead takes Ferrell out of his usually funny-man comfort zone and puts him in a role about life's lessons and understanding those around us."
1,Rotten,...a misguided failure that hardly bodes well for Pfister's directorial career.
1,Rotten,"This is one of those puzzle movies that's frustrating in pieces, and underwhelming once it's all fit together."
0,Fresh,"Captures, with both accuracy and fleeting optimism, those domestic arguments that end in either irritataed silence or half-hearted, good-enough-for-now reconciliation."
1,Rotten,"Despite the honest, authentic ideals, Disney's traditional animation studios can't cope with the imagination or storytelling of their colleagues, Pixar."
0,Fresh,Seeing Sir Anthony Hopkins crawl into Hannibal Lecter's skin one more time makes for gripping entertainment.
1,Rotten,When did Zhang Yimou start acting like Jean-Pierre Jeunet?
0,Fresh,The whole ensemble is played like a Stradivarius
0,Fresh,Watching this film is like hoping to be tossed a bride's bouquet.
0,Fresh,"Amazing Grace provides not only dynamic music, but a detailed glimpse into the time and place in which it was made. The music is moving, Franklin is stunning, and the church is full of characters."
0,Fresh,"Once Christopher Robin softens its insufferable, needlessly cynical conception of the title character, it offers more or less what a Pooh reboot should: a lot of nostalgia, a bit of humor and tactile computer animation."
0,Fresh,"Filmmaker Xavier Beauvois creates what feels like a timeless classic with its big story, intensely involving characters and French countryside setting."
0,Fresh,"It can only be confined within the limits of TERROR. One of those written in capital letters, one of those which marks and makes history. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,A telling look at the confusions and challenges facing seven friends who have recently graduated from the same college.
0,Fresh,"Possibly the funniest - and certainly the coolest - vampire film around, Only Lovers Left Alive works equally well as a spoof, a genre revamp and a two-hour trawl through Jim Jarmusch's cabinet of curiosities."
0,Fresh,"Anderson has imagined the '60s on the East Coast as if from an Eddie Bauer catalog and Boys' Life, with the sensibility of The New Yorker."
0,Fresh,"The film by Michael and Jeff Zimbalist is full of awesome surf footage on huge waves, but also a lot of emotional reminiscing among its stars, which include Taylor Steele, Kelly Slater, Rob Machado and about a dozen more."
1,Rotten,All texture and sublimated longing.
1,Rotten,"A cold, calculating virtual redux of The Bourne Identity that leaves a bitter aftertaste in its wake. Audiences have seen this all before, many times over."
0,Fresh,"At least half of these young dynamos and their families, all vying for coveted scholarships and spots in ballet companies, could brighten the most forlorn perspective on the state of the American dream."
1,Rotten,"The two leads create a sweet, believable romance that deserves a better movie."
1,Rotten,Less mysterious than confusing.
0,Fresh,The 'Best Use of a Carrot as a Weapon Award' goes to Clive Owen as Mr Smith
1,Rotten,"""Thor"" has its strengths, but it is finally something of a mishmash with designs on being more interesting than it manages to be."
0,Fresh,"Constantly touching, surprisingly funny, semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act."
1,Rotten,"The pacing is unyieldingly slow, while also missing that sense of creeping escalation that makes the better films of the Romanian art house moment so dreadfully effective"
0,Fresh,"Krasinski co-writes, directs and stars in the smart, nerve-wracking gut-punch of a monster flick, A Quiet Place."
1,Rotten,"Stealing freely from Save the Last Dance but unintentionally nixing the wicked dance moves, this teen turd doesn't even have the logical sense to remove its hunky lead's shirt."
0,Fresh,Shows how effective proximity can be in creating new friendships
1,Rotten,"All posturing and artifice -- not cool or funny, though sometimes scary in its nihilism and flippancy."
1,Rotten,"Billy Bathgate isn't an awful film, it's just an empty, terribly conventional $40 million exercise."
1,Rotten,Gamers would be better off playing Doom or sitting in front of a blank screen than wasting time with this incredibly dull Aliens rip-off.
0,Fresh,A postmodern pastiche for those who like the artifice of motion pictures and the sleazy side of America exposed with a smile.
0,Fresh,"With a weird balance between social comentary and family melodrama, Ricki and The Flash is an entertaining film even if its message about maternity is kind of confusing. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"How they managed to make a movie about a guy who went from poverty to fame to prison to fame again, before being shot five times and surviving, and then being shot four times and dying, into something as compelling as a tax return is anyone's guess."
0,Fresh,"Intense, gripping mental-illness music drama."
0,Fresh,"Highly sentimental social soaper, subtly crafted by director Stahl."
1,Rotten,"The film . . . ends up promising more than it can deliver. For all its epic locations, Jumper remains pretty small-scale."
1,Rotten,"Thankfully for Chicagoans this film doesn't star Brett Favre because of his numerical jersey affiliation, but with a story this weak, that stretch wouldn't be too far."
1,Rotten,'Voldemort is on the move!' said Sirius. 'You mean He Whose Name Must Not Be Spoken is relocating from the Location He Must Not Originate From to the Place Which Must Not Be His Destination!' said Harry.
1,Rotten,A cookie-cutter action film that hopes to stand on the shoulders of Twilight and Spider-Man but plays like Spider-lite.
0,Fresh,The Rise of Skywalker is less concerned with resolving a plot than it is with making you feel. J.J. Abrams can get emotion from Star Wars even if it doesn't really make sense.
0,Fresh,"Peoples is from Fort Worth, and her movie makes you feel like you're from there, too, in the way that Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird made you feel like you were from Sacramento. It's a comparably touching mother-daughter coming-of-age film."
0,Fresh,Good Time certainly puts the audience through an anxious time as Connie goes on a desperate odyssey through the night streets trying to put things right.
1,Rotten,"Shelf mold encrusts this misshapen adaptation of Spinning Into Butter, and Rebecca Gilman's 1999 play about racism and toxic political correctness at a small Vermont college  is lumpy enough as it is."
1,Rotten,"Redo the first movie, add a reality show element where everybody wears a personal cameras so not only do we get overacting, we get fuzzy video feeds and bad camera angles."
1,Rotten,Utterly devoid of wit or charm
1,Rotten,"Nary a tear-jerking trick is missed (our family loses one son to the Titanic, the other to World War I), and the strangulation is compounded by the staginess since the film."
0,Fresh,Moviegoers willing to tolerate Malick's origins-of-the-Earth ruminations eventually will come upon a universal American drama featuring one of Brad Pitt's strongest performances.
0,Fresh,Discriminating horror fans should also note that it's the most exhilarating fright flick to hit theatres since last year's The Descent.
0,Fresh,Crudup will grab your attention and make you remember what a great actor he can be.
0,Fresh,Abrams seems far more intent on delivering on the promise of the originals as rousing space Westerns where good and evil stood opposite one another and dared the other side to blink.
1,Rotten,...the biggest puzzle of Escape Room is why they didn't spend a little more developing such a promising idea.
1,Rotten,Good Boys is pretty darn far from being a bad movie. That still doesn't mean I'm personally interested in watching it again anytime soon.
0,Fresh,"[Jim] Jarmusch celebrates the ordinary because let's face it, most artists are struggling working class members of society who have to ""fit"" their passions into everyday life."
1,Rotten,"The pessimistic, passive-aggressive ""Ass Backwards"" may have been written by women, but one would never guess it judging by the evidence onscreen."
0,Fresh,"The formula is certainly typical for an urban action flick, but Foxx freshens it with his humorous, ultimately ingratiating portrayal."
0,Fresh,"Scream 4 is fun, but more clever-clever than fiendishly ingenious."
0,Fresh,Writer-director Peter Hedges has found a gem in young actor CJ Adams to play his magical character.
0,Fresh,"Powerful warning with universal message-movies lie. Without memory and context, we forget the truth and believe what we see. Meticulously detailed, overwhelmingly emotional."
0,Fresh,"Edgar Wright has a sure hand and a terrific filmic knowledge, and he and Simon Pegg have again crafted a script that goes back to the bare essentials of friendship in the face of adversity."
1,Rotten,"A brash, sarcastic just-about-family-friendly adventure."
1,Rotten,"Digital millions die in movies a lot now, but who gives a rat's? They're all just zeros and ones. Unless there's some visibly human traits, it's hard to care."
1,Rotten,"In the end, it's the unnecessary tricksiness of the film that halts its flow. A crucial human component is missing."
0,Fresh,the viewer is never allowed to feel he/she really understands what is going on. Strange ideas just keep being added to the mix.
0,Fresh,"It has some of the same comic absurdism that ran through Chris Morris's Four Lions, but the satire is combined with lyricism and a sense of mounting tragedy."
0,Fresh,"Perfectly pitched and bolstered by four beautiful lead performances, Our Little Sister, with the gentlest of touches, both breaks one's heart and makes it swoon."
1,Rotten,"The seamless integration of the CG animal characters with real-life ones and the general storybook look of the film remains impressive, but this being the second go-round it's that less dazzling; ditto for Nathan Lane's amusing wisecracks."
1,Rotten,The film's unreflective earnestness is haunting in all the wrong ways.
0,Fresh,"Superb as biography, as history, and as drama. It is one of the best movies of this year and this decade."
1,Rotten,Lumbers from lardy exposition to climax overload.
0,Fresh,Chock-full of quotable lines and silly surprises.
0,Fresh,I'd be just as entertained watching these people move along their normal daily lives - whatever scheme they're a part of is really just icing on the cake.
0,Fresh,"A spiffy, satisfyingly old-fashioned thriller with supernatural overtones that hangs together and, at barely eighty minutes, doesn't overstay its welcome."
0,Fresh,a bit like Goonies and War of the Worlds filtered through the original English version of Skins
0,Fresh,Pretty much every single thing about The Tribe is impressive.
0,Fresh,Often remembered as sentimental holiday-themed 'Capra-corn'... but in fact leavened by darker themes and a more rigorous moral about self-sacrifice.
1,Rotten,Starts off very promising and succeeds early on as unnerving thriller before getting choked out by an out there final act.
1,Rotten,"It's a tough one. It's a decent bit of mindless, blood-soaked fun with a strong performance from Stallone and some decent moments of emotion, which is what you'd expect from Rambo."
1,Rotten,"Slickly made but utterly gratuitous, this wannabe-edgy thriller was an odd choice for Ventimiglia to make during his first Heroes hiatus."
0,Fresh,"Dragon isn't an instant classic, but there's emotion and darkness in it."
1,Rotten,"""Thank God that's over with!"" one character utters near the end of ""John Carter."" No spoken words have ever been truer."
0,Fresh,"Ambitious in goal, John Millius' tale suffers from an inconsistent tone, trying to be elegiac, nostalgic, and mythical in depicting the impact of Vietnam and aging on a clique of three surfers between 1962 and 1974 but the acting and imagery are good."
0,Fresh,"Campanella uses the twin genres of the thriller and the romance, as well as twin narratives of punishment eluded and love unfulfilled, to give vividly palatable form to his themes of memory, justice and loss."
1,Rotten,"The movie dissolves into Cage running around trying to warn people about the numbers, but he doesn't know exactly what is going to happen or where it's coming from, so we get the crazy doomsayer routine by day and boozing while lamenting by night."
0,Fresh,"Part captivity thriller and part gut-wrenching familial drama, ""Room"" strikes a number of emotional chords that will make it tough to ignore this awards season."
1,Rotten,"The usual vengeance-hunter plot, acting's sandblasted by action, and the movie rips through Paris like a One-Man Army American on a single-minded mission."
0,Fresh,Everyone interested in the welfare of children and the future of our country should see it.
1,Rotten,Transports characters and altered states with the spunk of a deadly game of Go Fish.
0,Fresh,The story-line of writer-director Quentin Tarantino's ninth feature is one long high.
0,Fresh,"Wingard and Barrett's increasingly ludicrous schlocker has plenty of fun with genre convention, unafraid to laugh at itself as the bodies pile up and the knowing nods and winks become manic twitches."
0,Fresh,"Paul Rudd wears the constant look of glazed-eye amusement; everything seems to tickle him, even that which annoys or frustrates or disappoints him."
0,Fresh,"Cinematographer Robert Presley and the design team provide many instances of graphical triumph, influenced by silent cinema."
0,Fresh,"A provocative, dangerous tale that gets to real emotion because it doesn't play it safe."
0,Fresh,"You know...that balls-to-the-wall, ludicrous, stupid, ridiculous, amazing, awesome film that you thought you were getting with the first film? Well, better late than never."
0,Fresh,"Impossible to watch without undergoing visitations of vertigo, Safety Last's climactic sequence is all it's reputed to be."
1,Rotten,A mildly amusing film that gets a B for effort and a C- for execution.
0,Fresh,"Another mummy flick churned out by Universal, still creepy."
1,Rotten,"As if conceived during a Dukes of Hazzard shooting hiatus, Out Cold may be retro but it's sans daisy dukes."
1,Rotten,The idea that anyone would mistake Eugene Levy for Samuel L. Jackson is just about the funniest thing in this action-buddy comedy.
1,Rotten,The film quickly reveals that the only angle it's interested in is the one that most sympathizes Gary Hart.
0,Fresh,This comedy-drama has some modest charms.
1,Rotten,"Poorly acted, poorly written, and absolutely entertaining."
1,Rotten,This is an infomercial disguised as mildly entertaining cinema.
0,Fresh,"The pleasure...of Beirut is watching Hamm and his associates encounter the conflicting factions at play, work out what's actually going on, and then find a way to defuse the situation, most likely by getting each involved party what it wants."
0,Fresh,Now that's why we go to movies.
1,Rotten,Everybody fights and everybody lies in a thriller that tries to glamorize spies while demonizing their profession.
0,Fresh,"""The Dog"" is insanely, endlessly watchable, a compelling human-interest documentary and a riveting true-crime exploration all in one."
1,Rotten,How willing are you to sit through another Playstation-style movie where you can't reach for the controls?
0,Fresh,"Stalingrad is far from a perfect war film, but it does add up to an overall gratifying visual experience."
0,Fresh,This thoughtful character study is like watching a well-written short story unfold.
0,Fresh,"Since the movie does its job well in playing out its formulas, it becomes an effective endorphin rush at the time."

1,Rotten,"You might think The Amityville Horror is just a copy of the 1979 original, but there's much more to it than that. It's also a knockoff of at least four other movies and one music video."

0,Fresh,"Though the movie bears some of the Farrellys' trademark outrageous humor, it has a sweet demeanor and makes a noble statement."
0,Fresh,"The writers seem to catch on here how silly the premise is, so any hopes of a tense horror flick will be a fool's journey."
0,Fresh,"As the insecure, innocent ingenue, Sparks, 22, seems a bit tentative at first. But like her character, she gains her footing."

1,Rotten,Taking Lives is so lifeless and beside the point that its DVD version should skip letterboxing and just be shown in a heavy chalk outline.
0,Fresh,"The predictability can be a turn-off to some and even the feel-good and wholesome tone can be a bit much but overall, Eddie the Eagle is a fun time."
1,Rotten,"Freed of concerns like plausibility or story, you can simply gape in wonder at the ruthlessly thunderous images in front of you. Maybe that's the feeling of brain cells dying a painful, anguished death."
0,Fresh,"The Florida Project is not a sentimental film and never fetishises its protagonists' poverty. It's oddly beautiful though, lingering over the sun-dappled highlights of a childhood that's about to go bad."
1,Rotten,Hard to swallow fish tale.
0,Fresh,Train to Busan is a thrilling and gory zombie flick with a lot of heart. I'm not afraid to admit that it even made me cry.

1,Rotten,"Stella's groove, like the film itself, doesn't run deep."
0,Fresh,"Just go see it. This film is intelligent and well-constructed, brilliantly acted and visually beautiful. Do not go into this expecting a Holmes-and-Watson solve-the-case Baker Street whodunit; this story is more about the man than the mystery."
1,Rotten,"To recreate the gossipy Manhattan arena that Capote navigated with such ease and documented with such malice, you need dialogue that rings like scatter-shot and the film's script, written by its director Douglas McGrath, doesn't have it."

0,Fresh,"Exquisite gothic trappings, timeless fairy tale grue, and several sips of mortality."
1,Rotten,"Filmed as flatly as it is scripted, Winter Solstice has little to say about family dynamics because it just doesn't do enough to individuate this potentially interesting household of grieving, unsatisfied men."
1,Rotten,"While I understand and somewhat respect the apparent improv style for this movie, it did tend to lend itself to redundant and useless dialogue."

0,Fresh,"This movie is so five minutes ago, but still fun!"
1,Rotten,"Rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre, who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects."

0,Fresh,"In a world fraught with negativity, children and adults alike will appreciate The Grinch for its positive message."
1,Rotten,"Is it some monstrosity of awfulness, as its lack of advance screening suggested? No, that would imply at least a spark of some kind. This is just an empty summer hodgepodge of stale romantic comedy exchanges, witlessness and lackluster action."

0,Fresh,"Let's be clear: This is a popcorn flick. The CGI effects are laughable, and it takes a while to adjust to the willfully cheeseball tone, but once it clicks, it's irresistible. In this world, all you need is love. And sometimes a shotgun."
0,Fresh,"Visceral and bloody, but too slow-footed to make it a genre classic"
0,Fresh,"One of this year's requisite Sundance buzz-magnets. Star Maps has a queasy way of snowballing into dizzy psychodrama, and a knack for eluding cliches that is smart and sometimes amazing."
1,Rotten,"...more than two hours of high-priced explosion porn that piles on its chest-thumping ""America, f&%k yeah!"" machismo with a brazenness that makes Top Gun seem Merchant-and-Ivory quaint."

1,Rotten,"Night School is not only unbearably bad, but it is also ungodly long."
0,Fresh,"A sentimental crowd-pleaser, well-directed by Le McCarey, this tale about a priest (Bing Crosby) assigned to a problematic parish was so popular that Paramount reteamed the same players for The Bells of St. Mary's."

1,Rotten,... Set design ... cannot overcome a script so underwritten it makes its cast seem like it's cosplaying instead of bringing characters and the story to life.
0,Fresh,"A perfect balance of action and story, F8 seems designed to push back against all the bad things said about sequels, franchises and Hollywood's ""cookie cutter"" mindset. In a way, the film's message is ""if you're going to do it, do it like this."""
1,Rotten,The start of Turner's cinematic downward spiral

0,Fresh,"It's lurid, sexy, funny, chaotic, cluttered, and if the grisly violence turns you off then Blake Lively _ playing a very dumb blonde _ and her two beaus... will also chip in laugh-out-loud moments, all the while with the director winking off-scene."
1,Rotten,I'm Not There offers up a daring conceit and then falls apart trying to fulfill it.
1,Rotten,"This penultimate installment in the dour dystopian franchise offers stronger visual effects and more thought-provoking biopunk notions about genetic engineering than the two previous films, but even star Shailene Woodley looks bored."

1,Rotten,"The result is a corps of good actors stuck with feeble, unfunny material that could easily pass as a crime against the moviegoing public."
0,Fresh,Sachs expands his social consciousness beyond the gay ghetto ...a sign of social progress and the ultimate class assimilation. In Little Men this diversion takes the sting out of the first friendships that many gay men experience as first love.

1,Rotten,It should be no surprise that a flick about depressives turns into a depressing film.
1,Rotten,"The film had a tough predecessor to live up to, and it simply isn't as vibrant or joyous as its 1992 counterpart, nor does it do anything creative enough to justify its existence."
1,Rotten,We think you're better off playing the videogame -- at least there the characters don't speak.
0,Fresh,Tense and faithful adaptation of the Stephen King classic.
0,Fresh,"A typically ruthless and cynically comic horror thriller from Craven, set in a high school where the caste system is more terrifying than the possibility of a murderous ghost (the bullying leader of the mean girls is nicknamed 'Fang')."
1,Rotten,"The film is hectoring enough to put the green movement back 100 years, and you end up wondering how many trees have been felled and air-miles flown to make this abject excuse for slapstick comedy."
0,Fresh,"[B]rilliant. It's a gleaming, candy-colored fantasy that teems with mad invention ... There's no other film quite like this one."
0,Fresh,"Most impressive, though, is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds."
1,Rotten,"Life is messy, but the sprawl that overtakes ""Home Again"" is unwieldy and unwise, and detracts from Witherspoon's predictably plucky performance."

1,Rotten,"There's an extended animated sequence where atop a high hill, Kitai is surrounded by helix swells of grackles and blackbirds, and the camera turns to reveal waves and waves of burly bison. To the wonder, ho!"
0,Fresh,"The most interesting role, of course, is Ava, and Vikander nails it. It's actually possible to say of this film that it's worth seeing just for the robot."
1,Rotten,"The movie's fairly standard plotting comes as a disappointment, because the story -- drawn from an Anne Tyler novel -- has a dark sense of humor and plenty of Southern Gothic charm."
0,Fresh,A potent comedy of genetic chaos.
0,Fresh,Resistance is futile. It's impossible not to be swept up into the uplifting world of Mad Hot Ballroom.
1,Rotten,"As it is, Wonder Wheel does not take on an important existence of its own. Allen's self-conscious touch makes itself felt here too."

1,Rotten,"When we're watching these [type of] events unfold in news broadcasts on such a regular basis, I'm not sure I can take reliving them all over again at the movies."
0,Fresh,"Once again, the film is so over-serious that it's faintly ridiculous, but it's packed with nerve-jangling moments."
1,Rotten,"While most horror movies attempt to draw sympathy for its victims, Piranha revels in sadistic glee as thousands of teens are torn apart with unparalleled ferocity, turning crystal waters blood red for the adulation of the audience."
1,Rotten,More like The Dork Tower.
0,Fresh,"A taut moral thriller, ""Styx"" is a story of what happens when self-reliance runs into other people's desperation."
0,Fresh,"Not a happy portrait of a figure unburdened by the hard edge of criticism; it is a sad retelling, showing a woman who used the stage as a means to silence the nagging alarms of her demise."
1,Rotten,"The opening credits roll, the stage is set and then SHAZAM... all sense of logic magically disappears."

0,Fresh,"The beauty of this film is that as it carries us along we see how Carole's every reaction makes sense, even whilst occasional glimpses through the eyes of others show clearly that she has completely lost it."
0,Fresh,While disappointing (Rockwell's performance alone almost sunk this one) the reinvention of form by McKay and the perfect performance by Bale leads me to think this one will grow in my estimation in time.
0,Fresh,"More than simply highlighting prejudice, The Hate U Give peels back another layer and examines the issues that can divide the Black community from within."
0,Fresh,"A twisty Italian thriller that takes some liberties with its now-you-see-'em/now-you-don't plot points, but no matter; the way director Giuseppe Capotondi keeps us guessing is deliciously, maliciously deft."

0,Fresh,"Yeah, you almost certainly know how this is going to play out, but that doesn't keep the film from being compelling and even fascinating."
1,Rotten,"Tonya's hardships were depicted with straightforwardness; however, the film's narrative was not so effective, perennially wobbling between the cheaply dramatic and the absurdly comic."
1,Rotten,"Uninspired and inconsequential, The International provides less thrills than a meeting with your local bank manager to discuss interest rates."
0,Fresh,"An admirable and touching picture, ""Last Days In The Desert"" can be deeply moving in moments, but as restrained and elegant as it is, the picture never quite transcends."
0,Fresh,A better-than-average crime thriller with one of the most suspenseful capture sequences I've seen in years.
0,Fresh,"Assassins is a film that shines for its thrills, color, humor and suspense that lasts right to the very end."

1,Rotten,"A pleasant but plodding biopic of our longest-serving sovereign, mainly to be recommended for those with a limitless appetite for stately homes, lavish costumes and Mills & Boon romance."
0,Fresh,"It's by turns delightful, muddled, cathartic, and frustrating, sometimes within the same scene. And what could be more post-1977 Star Wars than that?"
0,Fresh,"Lurie wants us to see the moral wounds that come from losing control, a solid reason for a remake. Both takes on Straw Dogs hold up a dark mirror to humanity. Choose your own bad medicine."
1,Rotten,"While one shouldn't doubt the sincerity of this period drama about so-called gay conversion therapy, [it] isn't edgy or insightful enough to escape the lingering feel of a well-intentioned after-school special."
0,Fresh,Depp steals the show for the second time this year.
0,Fresh,"As it turns out, you can go home again."
1,Rotten,"Like the Fincher movie, this plays with the idea that the hero may actually be the villain; unlike the Fincher movie, which was built like a Swiss watch, this gradually turns into a tangle of flashbacks as it races toward a fairly predictable conclusion."
1,Rotten,"There is no doubt that Spacey does a great job of portraying the entertainer, but he's so wrapped up in this project that he fails to see that it's become a collection of musical numbers without any real heart."
1,Rotten,Just because anyone would agree with its message doesn't mean this glorified Lifetime movie does a worthy job of conveying it.
1,Rotten,"The plot unfolds at a nice clip, but at no point does director Ruba Nadda evade expectations."
1,Rotten,"Until your eyes glaze over after about a half-hour, ""Machete Kills"" might put a twisted smirk of guilty amusement on your face."
0,Fresh,"[It] doesn't aspire to be more than a broad, sloppy, old-fashioned sitcom with a sexy gimmick. But it is quite funny, and at the screening I attended, the loudest laughs came from young women in the audience."
0,Fresh,Wenders showcases his work while giving him a platform to express his philosophical and political views. The doc benefits from a subtly affecting use of music.
0,Fresh,There are enough laughs to recommend Mystery Men.
0,Fresh,"For me, it's a movie that's easy to admire but hard to hold close."
1,Rotten,The big battle scenes are especially disappointing.
0,Fresh,"""The Breaker Upperers"" is a film that I had a chance to see twice in one day. After the first viewing, with a second helping on offer, I did not hesitate, not for a second."
0,Fresh,"The first half of this film is the best, with the actors reciting the technical gibberish very convincingly, while trying to resuscitate a dog named Rocky. The second half is essentially conventional horror stuff we've seen before with this genre."
0,Fresh,"""Hellboy'' is great entertainment, a triumph for freaks and fans of self-determination that leaves you hoping for a sequel."
0,Fresh,"A rich emotional experience, ranging in degree from fire to ice."
0,Fresh,"Reitman has an impeccable talent for tearing out the spine of a novel and transposing it to the big screen, streamlining and simplifying a literary work without dumbing it down."
0,Fresh,Although the narrative for Their Finest occasionally rambles ... it is by-and-large a stirring drama that incorporates lighter moments with scenes of deeply felt tragedy.
0,Fresh,The central joke of the film is that the plague only exacerbates violent feelings that parents already feel for their children. Taylor finds enough ways to tell that joke to sustain interest the remaining hour of the film.
1,Rotten,Sporadically amusing camp mess.
1,Rotten,"This is akin to The Three Stooges meet The Farrelly Brothers but taken down about a dozen notches or so in terms of intelligence, creativity or imagination."
1,Rotten,"Romantic, sure, and it would have been without sinking the Titanic."
1,Rotten,"I can't really endorse paying full price for Samson, as the target audience will probably find it a little cheesy, and the camp-value audience might be better served waiting for cable."
0,Fresh,"On a production level and as an evocation of a time and place, Amadeus is loaded with pleasures."
0,Fresh,"Carolla, who co-wrote and co-directed the picture with Kevin Henchis, has a way of making his remarkably stiff screen presence endearing. He plays Bruce with gentle self-mockery and a touch of genuine pathos."
0,Fresh,"Robin Williams's vocal performance as the Genie steals the show in this beautifully constructed Disney animation, his ad-libbing a perfect match for the wonderful visuals."
0,Fresh,"The level-up, super fun, dance-dance, pop culture, max-combo, rock-n-roll romance video game film of, well, forever."
0,Fresh,"Loving Vincent"" is an emotional and spiritual mystery of sorts, an existential examination into a life and the art that sprang from a truly tragic figure."
0,Fresh,"In all respects, this is the completely captivating Fanning's picture."
0,Fresh,"In the mood for a teen twist on a James Cain mystery, with a soupcon of T&A? You could do worse than this slick variation on 'Double Indemnity.' ... The cinematic equivalent to beach reading."
1,Rotten,Cliched and clunky. Not really a great showcase for Cruise or Chris Penn.
1,Rotten,Romantic comedies don't get more generic than this one.
0,Fresh,"At some point, someone will write the history of this modern comedy of the uncomfortable, and when they do, I hope they devote an entire chapter to 'Klown.'"
1,Rotten,"At its best The Hummingbird Project is a parable about failure, but one that ultimately undercuts itself with redeeming goo."
0,Fresh,"There is a grand, old-fashioned sense of matinee serial wonderment in their writing that is quite invigorating, the movie coming alive time and time again thanks to their rich and hearty dialogue."
0,Fresh,...an engaging yet uneven little revenge thriller.
0,Fresh,"Always bet on Diesel - especially when he's doing what he's most average at, which happens to be starring in sci-fi ""Conan the Barbarian"" knock-offs."
0,Fresh,"A glorious, perversely satisfying conclusion to a labor of love ... and a grand entertainment in its own right."
0,Fresh,"It is aimed at elementary schoolers, but is sharp and light enough that any fan of the superhero genre will enjoy its take on the comic universe and its pokes at superhero conventions."
1,Rotten,How could something that is so gorgeous also be so damn dull?
0,Fresh,Without Jackson -- and a little help from Alan Alda and Peter Coyote -- this would be another in the long line of instantly forgettable Josh Hartnett vehicles.
0,Fresh,This thing's a winner.
1,Rotten,"The target audience of Baby Geniuses is a mystery: the film is too inane for adults, too advanced for kids."
0,Fresh,"The Words resonates - richly, remarkably."
0,Fresh,Impossible to follow the plot but easy to appreciate the thrilling shootout at the Guggenheim.
1,Rotten,"There's no dismissing the film, if only because it offers another long, loud example of how Hollywood remains the hagiographic spinmeister of American war history."
0,Fresh,"Not just dark but dank, Denis Villeneuve's ""Enemy"" is a surpassingly creepy film about identity."
0,Fresh,"The cinematic equivalent of that first beautiful day of spring ... when you can take off your coat and go to the park, bob your head with the radios playing to the open, sweet-scented air and watch the pretty girls walk by."
0,Fresh,"A peerless Freudian nightmare, frequently revisited but seldom matched in its desire and terror, its visual-aural flow, and its queasy voyeuristic pleasure in seeing a frosty princess picking at her own skin"
0,Fresh,The slow-motion close-ups alone should convince you these magnificent creatures are well worth the effort.
1,Rotten,It's all very silly in a spectacularly unengaging way.
0,Fresh,"Against all expectations, Hairspray turns out to be an explosion of industrial-strength good cheer, delivered by very smart show-biz pros with wit, passion, and a soupçon of dementia. Resistance is futile."
0,Fresh,Writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour's feature debut is a gorgeously-photographed and highly unconventional vampire tale about the willful ignorance sometimes required to see the best in the people we suck on and sometimes even love.
0,Fresh,"Some may find it overly sentimental, but I fell for it hook, line and sinker. A sweet thing indeed."
1,Rotten,Watching these people together on the screen in 2014 reminds you how cruel the passage of time can be and how far some have fallen since their 1980s glory days.
0,Fresh,"It's fast-paced and funny, strangely warm and suddenly creepy, disarmingly charming and admirably icky, all at the same time."
1,Rotten,Ron Howard's third (and weakest) stab at a Dan Brown adaptation...
0,Fresh,An absorbing film with one of Hugh Jackman's best performances to date. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,A $45 million design problem with 98 minutes of weak prehistoric jokes.
1,Rotten,"There's not much reason to watch this ""Whisky Galore!"" so long as the 1949 version still exists."
0,Fresh,"Strayed is clear-eyed about her responsibility for her life's unraveling and realistic about what the trail can do. As Witherspoon plays her, she is foul-mouthed and tender, broken and strong."
1,Rotten,"Airless, joyless"
1,Rotten,The Wave is two-thirds of a cool movie. The final third becomes didactic in a way that's disappointing in its predictability.
0,Fresh,"The true power of Blue Ruin is its ability to find tension in the little things, not showy acts of violence."
0,Fresh,"Director Cathy Yan and writer Christina Hudson, along with the game Robbie, have crafted a Harley who's daffy but crafty, enraged but never petulant, more exuberant than maniacal."
0,Fresh,It's the rare occasion where Peter Cushing plays the good guy.
0,Fresh,This debut offering from Sony Pictures Animation has a giddy energy about it and a gleeful sense of its own weirdness.
0,Fresh,"Matchstick Men is really two movies brilliantly spliced into one, each enriching the other."
0,Fresh,This ode to a bygone style of entertainment is a fitting swan song for Altman.
1,Rotten,"Crazy, Stupid, Phony"
0,Fresh,... a worthwhile film that's an unusually honest portrayal of teen life.
0,Fresh,"Buck and Schlingmann's naughty pre-code sensibilities give the film additional bite, but what they've created is blazingly original and while ""Sister Aimee"" sees its star running away from the Lord, you can expect to be saying ""Praise Be"" by the end."
0,Fresh,"This is a brutal, occasionally inelegant film, but it pulls no punches and shines a stark, pitiless light on its subject."
0,Fresh,The Green Hornet looks and feels as if it were made by a bunch of (highly talented) 10-year-old boys. Taking any pleasure in the film depends on your willingness to let your inner-child run rampant.
1,Rotten,Bourne was the franchise that helped rescue Matt Damon's career after Oscar-bait bombs ... Now it's the franchise that he's going to have to leave behind and find the next big thing.
0,Fresh,"Despite its flaws, Ender's Game represents a marked improvement from Hood's 2009 misfire X-Men Origins: Wolverine."
0,Fresh,Peck's film serves as an indictment: America has failed itself.
1,Rotten,Sadly devoid of any real thrills.
0,Fresh,a daring film that explicitly prefigures the surge of anti-Nazi cinema that was to come
1,Rotten,"A basic, no-frills, novelty toy slasher fest."
0,Fresh,"Its scattered pacing and tangled subplots doesn't make THE LAST JEDI a failure, but neither is it a celebration - or more importantly, an elevation - of anything other than the legacies of the late Carrie Fisher, and justly revered Mark Hamill"
0,Fresh,"Whedon has delivered that rare action-packed, special-effects spectacle that is relentless in its eagerness to please and successful beyond its goal."
0,Fresh,"For a film about the power of speech, it's the quiet moments of rapture that say everything."
0,Fresh,It's hard not to get carried along.
1,Rotten,"Here's hoping cartoons and noir will meet again on another, more auspicious, day."
1,Rotten,"A sadly muddled mess that never comes close to settling on what type of film it's supposed to be, and more importantly, what it's supposed to be about."
1,Rotten,"Valor does emerge in The Guardian, but often is eclipsed by an effects-driven star vehicle."
0,Fresh,"Until the ugly climax (mitigated if not exactly redeemed by a poignant coda), this is Tarantino's most tender and transcendent film, filled with yearning for a minutely specific-yet-fairy tale past, and brimming with swoon-worthy performances..."
1,Rotten,"Consistently, astonishingly, inventive ... relentlessly and ruthlessly vile. Style may ultimately not be able to triumph over content, but it's one hell of a fight."
1,Rotten,"Begins with two awful segments, which you'll want to fast-forward past to get to the third and fourth segments."
0,Fresh,"Less turns out to be much more for S-VHS, a sequel to last year's uneven indie horror omnibus V/H/S; this one is shorter and has fewer segments, but also earns a much higher batting average."
0,Fresh,"An amusing, touching, reassuringly wholesome romantic travelogue of a film that flies by on its way to the inevitable happy ending."
0,Fresh,"Amadeus is a masterful combination of acting and storytelling, of sight and sound."
0,Fresh,"Director Antoine Fuqua throws every boxing/sports film trope he has at us, and after a while it does feel used...but the emotion is thick enough and the boxing scenes so well executed that much of the story's ease can be forgiven."
0,Fresh,Pitt's best work since A River Runs Through It.
1,Rotten,"Isle of Dogs is beautifully designed, but narrated poorly. It's a contradiction that pretends to talk about fidelity that only serves to inspire something so fickle. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, The Graduate could only offer that the young would shut out the old and start over. Garden State is about the next season, about getting off the bus."
0,Fresh,"A phantasmagorical movie directed by Danny Boyle filled with dazzling and varied sights of India, characters we can identify with and cheer for, and a jubilant message about destiny and love."
0,Fresh,... one of the most adventurous explorations in the field of the musical documentary. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"All I kept writing down in my notes during the movie was ""gruesome"" ""I can't breathe"" ""My stomach is in knots."""
0,Fresh,Gast's presentation is super-slick and surprisingly dynamic for a film concerned with still images.
0,Fresh,Ruffalo's performance alone is worth the price of a ticket...
1,Rotten,Never comes off as desperate--because little effort appears to be put forth by writer-director-co-star DJ Pooh.
1,Rotten,Watch Evil Dead at your own risk...
1,Rotten,It's a visually arresting and intermittently compelling parable about racism and self-determinism that's ultimately too arch and pedantic for its own good.
0,Fresh,Cohn ... adeptly balances elements of contemporary romantic comedy and scathing cultural criticism in a film that is obviously deeply personal and simultaneously universal.
1,Rotten,"From the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers opening, through the Starsky & Hutch ""gunfight in a warehouse"" set-pieces, to the contractual-obligation shots of Kurylenko's bum, this is utter pants."
1,Rotten,"It boggles the mind that anyone would try to make something mannered from her wild, sad, huge life...a dismal book report that the author herself would have declared fusty."
1,Rotten,"Halloween manages to combine the weaknesses of both of Zombie's previous movies, while rarely tapping into the strengths of either."
1,Rotten,"A perfect storm of aggressively repulsive choices, it's a queasy bad trip worth avoiding at all costs."
0,Fresh,"A slim, charming, romantic story, full of intentionally mild humor about strong themes -- passion, commitment, loneliness."
1,Rotten,"The only way to even potentially sell any of this was to play it so straight that it hurts a little, and Akiva Goldsman and crew did that, even when it broke the film."
0,Fresh,It makes Independence Day look like The Muppet Movie.
0,Fresh,"Priceless begins as standard, unconvincing, assembly-line French farce and ends as a cop-out, feel-good rom-com. In between, it develops into something considerably more interesting."
0,Fresh,"Among other things, Mr. Herzog visually dazzles us while he's pulling the rug from under our feet."
1,Rotten,"When all's said and done, the most that can be remarked about it is how odd it is that this Hitchcock picture is so very predictable."
0,Fresh,About as hit-and-miss a comedy as one could envision...
0,Fresh,"Although Into the Wild carries with it a tragic undercurrent, Penn illuminates the graceful aspects of Christopher's ultimate search for self to overall illuminating effect."
1,Rotten,"Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise, but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness."
0,Fresh,"Rarely has a film so funny, chilling and revealing as American Psycho graced the silver screen."
0,Fresh,"An epic noir thriller that contains no small amount of excitement, it suggests that Na might well be the best action director currently working in Korea."
1,Rotten,I kept hoping someone would arrive on the scene with a Veg-O-Matic and put a stop to it.
0,Fresh,[Gadot] seems born to play the part. Her ragtag band of sidekicks are a huge breath of fresh air next to the usual super-hero super-groups we're accustomed to.
0,Fresh,"A somewhat entertaining movie of the politically-incorrect, testosterone-laden brainless pure action variety."
1,Rotten,"The hero's allies pop up and disappear; killers are on his heels, then they aren't. And that whole business about the Christian evangelical leader whose father is a Catholic priest? Yeah, that doesn't get explained either."
0,Fresh,"Feels Good Man is a depressing and only fleetingly and darkly amusing experience, but then again, so is much of the internet these days."
1,Rotten,"Though it has some heart, the film doesn't hit the funny bone like its trailer teased."
0,Fresh,"A little rough around the edges, Barking Dogs Never Bite still delivers the blackest comedy lightened by some thrilling filmmaking... Caninophiles beware."
0,Fresh,"A compelling, mostly positive story, despite Little Tree's bad luck."
0,Fresh,"Quite frankly, the story was trying my patience for a while."
1,Rotten,"Veteran TV director John Gray brings little or nothing new to conflicts we've seen in an endless stream of movies, including Saturday Night Fever and (to go straight to the top of the list) Mean Streets."
0,Fresh,"Well-acted if uneven biopic about RBG's early life, career."
1,Rotten,Another feature to remind us all just how brilliant The Exorcist was back in '73 and how almost every possession flick since has paled by comparison.
1,Rotten,"If the first Karate Kid was a coming of age tale, what does the new version, with its young protagonist, aspire to? Dre's a kung fu master before the onset of puberty, which is a reminder that kids really do grow up too fast today."
0,Fresh,Involving domestic drama that lingers a little too long at the kitchen sink.
0,Fresh,"If we grant that ""Carnage"" is a low-impact exercise in stripping away the social veneer, it's nonetheless brisk and enjoyable."
0,Fresh,"One of the weirdest westerns of all time, reflecting the eccentricities of its producer and credited director, Howard Hughes."
0,Fresh,"Comes billed as being ""From the imagination of Charles Schulz,"" and, almost astonishingly, it pretty much is."
0,Fresh,"Witty, whimsical farce with some cartoonish violence."
1,Rotten,What manner of beast might have evolved on Earth had a single butterfly been squashed 65 million years ago? Monkeysaurus!
1,Rotten,"There are so many good reasons to bag ""The Bag Man."" Where to begin?"
0,Fresh,"This is a movie about faith tested, and people trying to reconcile hope with a world that can feel hopeless. It's a film to be seen in a dark theater with an audience hushed in reverence of the power of cinema."
1,Rotten,"Almodvar's style is there, but something is missing. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"A potent, energised slice of South African life."
0,Fresh,"Sometimes a rewarding movie theater experience comes from a simple film that doesn't promise more than it can deliver. ""Show Dogs"" promises talking dogs who fight crime. It delivers."
1,Rotten,"Reynolds and, to some degree, Chris Rock are the only reasons I can think of to see this film - and even their performances are cancelled out by 45 seconds of Rob Schneider."
0,Fresh,"'Hulk, smash,' is the inner-child battle cry of the comic-book world, and this mash-'em-up mantra is finally getting its due on the big screen."
1,Rotten,The ill-conceived climax will strike the easily manipulated as deep but will cause most discerning viewers to recognize it for a cheap trick that should come with some sort of trigger warning before it unfolds.
1,Rotten,"If you want to enjoy a campy but fun B-movie, then go with a real B-film . . . Don't fall for mainstream Hollywood's pale big-budget imitation."
0,Fresh,"If you walk into a screening of Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker with a set of fulsome fingernails, expect to leave with stubs. If you're a chronic nail biter, except to leave with half your fingers gnawed off."
0,Fresh,Depp terrifies as dangerously violent real-life gangster.
0,Fresh,"The film is passionate and insightful about its topic, and not just intended as some sort of cheap scare tactic."
1,Rotten,"A few bright spots aside, Bowfinger's jokes almost universally fall flat, with missed comic opportunities buzzing by at every turn."
0,Fresh,"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days unspools as dispassionately as a security camera video. There are no judgments rendered here, only truths that arise from harrowing insights."
0,Fresh,"An intense, haunting, often beautifully crafted character study and meditation on the nature of death and life after death."
0,Fresh,Top-notch espionage thriller with a jaw-dropping finale atop the Statue of Liberty.
1,Rotten,"It is, alas, stuck down the very same 'dirty hole' of the British horror market where the likes of Lesbian Vampire Killers and Evil Aliens reside, desperate to pump their captive audience full of all the shit it can take and more."
1,Rotten,"The funniest thing about Lockout, a film that is not without several amusements of a subsidiary nature, is the notion that it is based on an ""original idea."""
1,Rotten,Only a pleasure if ye can handle the guilt.
0,Fresh,"If the movie is over-reliant on slo-mo, voiceover and almost wall-to-wall music to drive scenes, its silky blend of lyricism with urban grit marks it as a promising debut."
0,Fresh,"Whatever middling, underdeveloped story the initial acts deliver is wiped away and forgotten the instant the protagonist steps out on that wire."
1,Rotten,"The movie is shamelessly manipulative on several levels, and the cast members do their respective bits effectively."
1,Rotten,This is one time-travel movie that isn't interested in the paradoxes inherent in time travel. It has much more fundamental paradoxes to worry about.
0,Fresh,"There's an insidious cleverness to ""The Overnight"" that keeps the audience just a bit off balance."
1,Rotten,What should have been an amiable if unremarkable comedy never rises much above the chuckle level as it attempts to pay homage to the eccentricity of small town life
1,Rotten,"This making-of-a-star drama is old-fashioned and corny, and not in a good way."
1,Rotten,"The Queen of Spain...has to pose this question to start its engine: is this needed? Unfortunately, the answer is a resolute ""no""."
0,Fresh,"A powerful experience, but a bleak and ultimately dispiriting one."
1,Rotten,"Except for Clarke, who walks an ambiguous line between heroism and sinister monomania, only Big Arnie leaves the slightest impression after the credits roll."
1,Rotten,The Descent was better when the women were battling nature and their own demons rather than monsters capable of crawling across ceilings.
0,Fresh,More graphic in its violence and more fantastic in its imaginings than the first film.
0,Fresh,What the film lacks in originality it mostly makes for in personality-a quality fatally lacking from too many contemporary extreme-horror offerings.
1,Rotten,"Ali lands a few solid blows, but, sadly, it's no knockout."
0,Fresh,... the best movie of 1998...
0,Fresh,"This one offers some agreeably mindless fun in which the villains (including Norton) are truly villainous, the payback is satisfying in a purely infantile way, and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting."
1,Rotten,"Too much of ""Refueled"" suffers from an assembly-line familiarity, with even the notion of a taciturn transporter not exactly innovative by this point."
0,Fresh,Bumblebee rises from what was left behind of the previous films and gives us a story with heart. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"If you can detach yourself from the back-and-forth vituperation (perhaps an impossible project), the Nader story begins to resemble a grand tragedy about the American left."
1,Rotten,"The Temp is as unimaginative as thrillers get, with a plot-by-numbers script and insipid direction."
0,Fresh,"How is dating in India different from dating in America? Indian culture is roughly 11,000 years old; ours-239 years. Dating is hilariously, eye-openingly different in India."
0,Fresh,"Do not be perturbed by the animation and animals, this movie is important, intellectual and hilarious."
1,Rotten,"There is music, the laughs are far and few between and character development is just about nil, but hey, it's Bill Murray and his fans love him."
0,Fresh,The paradox of wealth without refinement remains unexamined but emerges as a metaphor for the American Dream itself.
1,Rotten,The final image -- a freeze frame of a pas de deux staged to resemble a triumphal Communist poster -- perfectly captures the film's overall effect: it's strenuously brainless.
0,Fresh,"Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning and Angourie Rice play young, frustrated women whose various foibles are skilfully revealed during Coppola's elegant, well-acted and wickedly funny drama."
1,Rotten,A genuinely ugly film.
0,Fresh,"Contiene los elementos bsicos de toda cinta pica: una estrella en el rol principal, hermosas mujeres y grandes batallas"
0,Fresh,Joseph Levy's sneakily stirring documentary opens up feelings you would never have expected from the premise-a portrait of three American restaurants.
1,Rotten,"Its 'Saturday Night Live'-esque parade of improbable celebrity impersonations kept me entertained: You'd probably have to attend a Halloween party hosted by Turner Classic Movies to find a less convincing John Wayne, Kirk Douglas or Edward G. Robinson."
0,Fresh,Sloma is always interesting to watch: She's even almost credible when tasked with delivering the film's thesis in the form of a lesson learned.
0,Fresh,"A modest, tightly wound, straightforward story about a dangerous task performed by disposable men under severe conditions."
0,Fresh,"Rousing throwback and up-to-the-minute satire, Chicago puts the ""all"" in all that jazz."
1,Rotten,"Virtually nothing happens, and it happens at the most unrelenting speed."
1,Rotten,"Ah, the problems of twenty-somethings in the Real(ly Fake) World."
0,Fresh,"While not as good as Iron Man, it's a fast-paced, action-packed popcorn picture."
0,Fresh,Edge of Tomorrow feels like it's about something more than action. Neat trick.
0,Fresh,"Qualifies as a solid double, maybe a triple."
1,Rotten,"Rush Hour 3 is an awfully spare title for such a big-money enterprise, but an appropriate subtitle like Auto Pilot or Once More For The Cash would have given the game away."
1,Rotten,"No doubt about it, Alison Eastwood has picked up a thing or two from her old man. Her debut feature is slow, deliberate, assured, and shot with a graceful feel for place -- none of which is enough to overcome the creaky themes."
1,Rotten,"[An] nime thriller [that] often plays as an examination of identity and celebrity, but ultimately gets so lost in its own complex structure that it doesn't end up saying much at all."
0,Fresh,Riccobono creates a credible panorama of modern small-town America.
1,Rotten,"But after a while, the preponderance of creepy teases - a freaky doll, a bloody ghost, a surly handyman, a chorus of whispery voices and more - makes this feel like a supernatural thriller that can't settle on how exactly it wants to scare the audience."
0,Fresh,An extraordinary performance from Benicio Del Toro anchors this long but gripping film based on a powerful true story.
1,Rotten,Too many lengthy silences and butt-scratching pauses.
0,Fresh,Deliciously Dark!
1,Rotten,The Hustle will fail to seduce the most important mark in any heist movie: the audience.
0,Fresh,A refreshingly substantial and thought-provoking sci-fi experience.
1,Rotten,"An impressive feat that relies on distraction rather than fancy effects, ""Point Blank"" makes it easy to get swept up and forget that it's a very sweaty retread that's been done many times before."
0,Fresh,"In You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, the only people who retain their happy visions are the most deluded. It's probably a good metaphor for 2010."
1,Rotten,"This remake is just a watered-down version that hits all of the same beats as the original, only judges its nominal hero far less harshly, and emerges an oddly amoral film with an ending that borders on being ludicrous"
1,Rotten,"Despite the potential for disaster Brooks sets up with the title, the movie is relatively harmless. It's just so very harmless that it doesn't make much of an impression."
0,Fresh,A small gem that boasts some of the most rapturous visuals of 2003.
1,Rotten,"A waste of a rich premise, excellent special effects, and a charismatic cast."
0,Fresh,"There's plenty of grandstanding, most of it very funny. And in this instance, all that sizzle is selling the steak."
0,Fresh,David Zeiger's superb documentary about the Vietnam War era's GI protest movement is jammed with incident and anecdote and moves with nearly as much breathless momentum as the movement itself.
0,Fresh,"Law conjures a somewhat dim man who yet has quite the way with words, a hair trigger guy who might cry or bite your face off at any given moment. It's a balls to the wall performance and utterly entertaining."
0,Fresh,"Isn't it valuable that Lee refuses to make that gentle church movie we expected? He has to grab the live wire of referendum, go deeper into his Breslinesque outrage."
0,Fresh,Mark Robson has made realistic use of the actual Italian setting of the David Westheimer novel in garmenting his action in hard-hitting direction and sharply-drawn performances.
0,Fresh,"I can accept [Huppert's] obsession, but not her love, which makes the movie come off significantly different than it was probably intended."
1,Rotten,"The story is so rich with thematic elements that the zombie element could have been cut out of the film entirely. Then again, the zombies are what will sell the tickets."
0,Fresh,"It's a visual banquet of a film, which meditates on ageing with wit and tenderness."
1,Rotten,"Despite the veneer of vomit-stained raucousness, it's fairly mild stuff ..."
0,Fresh,"Christopher Walken, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Imogen Poots and Ukrainian actor Mark Ivanir all give pitch-perfect performances, grounding the heavy emotion in realism and understatement."
0,Fresh,A perfectly good but utterly unremarkable drama that wouldn't garner much attention if it weren't the directorial debut of The Daily Show host Jon Stewart.
1,Rotten,"Do the people who made Coffee & Kareem think that it's a refreshing throwback? How can they not know that these kinds of movies happen all the time, and sometimes even make sense?"
0,Fresh,"Even though the story's a bit scattered, Gangster energetically evokes the hip '60s with groovy split-screen effects and a swinging soundtrack."
0,Fresh,Pleasant enough old fashioned Warner musical with Day and MacRae singing the true oldies.
0,Fresh,A Good Ol' Fashioned Roll In The Hay
0,Fresh,"Almost everyone will like Plus One, but there's a certain subset of hopeful yet slightly jaded romantics who will absolutely love it."

0,Fresh,"Who else but Johnny Depp would Gore Verbinski want to voice the character of Rango, given how they worked together to create Jack Sparrow, a Pirate in the Caribbean ... Rango, let's face it, is another colourful character."
1,Rotten,"This is the kind of smug, listless product that the world, indie or otherwise, would be better off without."
0,Fresh,"As you'd expect, it's a big, handsome film, rich and strange in psychological depths and eroticism. Malkovich and Winger play woundingly well."
0,Fresh,"[Unfinished Song] is a British film that's sure to fly under the radar this summer, which is a shame since it's an entertaining little story about love, regret and aging."
0,Fresh,"Miranda, a busy and successful director of commercials, shoots it all with slick economy and efficiency."

0,Fresh,I find it endearing that the Madagascar movies spend most of their time chronicling failure.
1,Rotten,It's not a lack of originality that makes Shopgirl too Saks for its own good; it's the attempt to make a distinctive item into a blue-light special that betrays it.
0,Fresh,"Though thriving in its set-up, Ben Affleck's return to the director's chair for the first time since the Oscar winning Argo, falls short in its pay-off, becoming needlessly convoluted as we progress throughout the narrative."
1,Rotten,"Absent is the pure guilty joy of sequential puzzle-solving; instead of participating in the hunt, we're shoved off to the side as a couple of crashing boors do it for us."
1,Rotten,"Hail, Caesar! is finally all too effortful, a doodle undertaken by scholars."
0,Fresh,This is pretty sophisticated for so-called kid stuff.
0,Fresh,"LIFE is fairly low-key, yet it breathes with an honesty and an astuteness."
1,Rotten,"There's little doubt that Franco groks the octogenarian novelist in ways the common man does not. But that's not reason enough to subject yourself to his punishing, ultra low-budget adaptation of the McCarthy's 1973 work Child of God."
0,Fresh,A hard-hitting political film about character assassination.
0,Fresh,Mirren and Plummer together in The Last Station create their own cinematic event.

1,Rotten,"Even for one interested in bio-horror, RE:A is pretty generic stuff."
1,Rotten,"[Faris'] relationship with co-star Huang, while cordial, hardly reflects an emotional connection strong enough for him to conquer his character's post-romantic breakup stress syndrome."
0,Fresh,Readers of the books will surely be still delighted with Rapace's intense performance and those not familiar with them should enjoy an above-average thriller.
0,Fresh,"It's an enjoyable dramedy with outstanding, nuanced performances."
0,Fresh,"A slick, stylish melodrama with an involving story and a cracking cast. Star Adriana Ugarte is a real find."
0,Fresh,"The movie's a fascinating mess, grand and gaudy, often hilarious."
0,Fresh,"It can be argued, I suppose, that Blood Work was designed from the outset not so much as a whodunit as a why-and-how-dunit, and here the film becomes metaphysically ingenious."
1,Rotten,"The movie is the opposite of the cartoons: Everyone's body is in motion, but nobody is using his head."
0,Fresh,"Tonal issues aside, however, Affleck's third feature is assured, smart and very entertaining."
0,Fresh,St. Bernard Syndicate is an adequate film for what it is.
0,Fresh,"Una película entretenida y emotiva sobre la idea de la pérdida, el dolor, la culpa, y sobre todo de la imaginación como válvula de escape. No es el típico pasatiempo inocente que promete; es mucho más interesante que eso."

1,Rotten,The Benchwarmers strikes out. Again and again and again.
0,Fresh,"...perfectly satisfying, if not jump-up-and-down brilliant."
0,Fresh,"A welcome return to the filmmaker's late '90s style; unlike his far grimmer recent output, here the occasionally overpraised writer-director is at his best counterbalancing the bleak with the bizarre."
1,Rotten,"The TV show was mildly subversive, with humor that children and adults could enjoy on different levels, but the movie strives for a blander, family-oriented middle ground."

1,Rotten,"I count a baker's dozen of movie plots here, a tally so impressive that the qualifier -- all of them are inane -- seems almost ungenerous."
0,Fresh,"Like Bogdanovich's masterpiece, Last Picture Show, this film is at once an evocation of childhood in a specific time and place (story is inspired by a Shirley Temple vehicle) and a commentary on it. Remarkably shot in b/w by ace lenser Laszlo Kovac."
0,Fresh,"A light feminist streak runs through this comedy, which is well acted by Kendrick but is better written than directed."

1,Rotten,"What a story like this requires is a gentle subtlety, but Boyle is certainly not gentle and far from subtle."

0,Fresh,"A gripping, deeply affecting experience delivered with no Hollywood hooey but an appreciation of small lives and human foibles."
1,Rotten,"Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson is utterly lacking in charisma ... His complete lack of presence is deadening to the film because he's in almost every scene."
0,Fresh,"Most importantly, though, Selma reminds us where the violence started - with the insidious, everyday practice of denying African Americans their legal right to vote."
1,Rotten,"The tale is there for the taking, but miscasting, violent repetition, and a lack of character depth make the picture feel forgettable, even during its most evocative and emotional moments."
0,Fresh,"[Jeunet] strikes a giddy balance between comedy and terror, romance and incandescent action, between the demands of his huge canvas and his intimate emotional subject."
1,Rotten,"Despite a certain manic energy, the comic schtick between Lane and Broderick feels as stale as last year's croissants; you can tell they've done these jokes a thousand times."

0,Fresh,"A boxed-in [but] entertaining diversion... a small-scale surrealist love story anchored by two fully committed, highly watchable actors."
1,Rotten,"The real weak point is Reiner's listless direction, with too few scenes that almost gel and too many that fall flat."
1,Rotten,Queen of the Damned's target audiences are those younger moviegoers who attend raves and an appreciate the heavy metal and goth sensibilities. All others will probably find it alien terrain.
0,Fresh,"A live-action stealth video game, complete with traps, night-vision and chest-high walls [...] In short: it's pretty cool."
1,Rotten,"Queasiness abound but there are no real jolts; the words ""foreskin"", ""anus"" and ""vulva"" are unlikely to disturb anyone under the age of 97."

1,Rotten,Feels like a TV movie.
1,Rotten,"Looking like a work-for-hire, the adaptation of J.M. Ledgard's romantic novel Submergence doesn't manage to touch or excite."
1,Rotten,"Light on plot but heavy on action, American Assassin is mostly forgettable but works well enough when it focuses on the dynamic between Michael Keaton and Dylan O'Brien."
0,Fresh,"A Dangerous Method will feel like Cronenberg in a corset. The director sticks so close to the documented facts that there is little room to breathe, making for a smart film that feels a bit too literary."

1,Rotten,"Each new Bond movie gains a larger budget, but the potential doesn't equate to greater creativity or superior filmmaking."

1,Rotten,Overall too bland to hold our interest.
1,Rotten,Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart didn't stop being funny. Their new movie Get Hard is just so bad in so many ways that it may make you think this is true.

1,Rotten,That the super villain resembles nothing so much as a giant tentacled dust-bunny with teeth does nothing to make it strike fear in the hearts of the audience
1,Rotten,"It's the writing and plotting in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" that sucks. Not the staging of scenes. Not the film's sense of humor. Not the film's quality action sequences."

0,Fresh,There is not a single moment in the entire movie in which we are able to guess what [Huppert] will do next -- and that's what makes Elle such a wild and surprising ride.
1,Rotten,"At the 44-minute mark (I checked) of 'Mr. Nobody,' I loudly sighed and asked, ""Good God, when the hell is this movie going to START!"""
0,Fresh,"Though the film can ultimately be faulted for pulling its punches...simply having the courage to indulge in some very risky conceits at holiday time, particularly during harsh economic conditions -- merits Smith and his colleagues enormous kudos."

0,Fresh,By focusing in on just a few individuals and letting the rest of the story unfold in the background Soderbergh makes a micro experience into a macro one.
1,Rotten,"For the most part, The Devil Wears Prada is a broadly woven series of truisms and generalities in which fashion itself is an accessory."
1,Rotten,"Taking Lives won't kill you, but it will steal precious hours you'll never have back."
0,Fresh,Soderbergh knows how to develop good characters and maximise the talent at his disposal. Logan Lucky is a brilliant example of just that. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"The story is told in the recognisable Hollywood manner, polished and packaged, but that doesn't detract from its impact.. it also tackles some of the darker materials of the story"
0,Fresh,"Taking her cues from Hitchcock, Reichardt invites us to connect (if not quite empathise) with unlikable characters as they attempt to accomplish undesirable outcomes."
0,Fresh,"This episodic drama is set in Dallas during the three days after the JFK assassination, and some of it is highly charged."
0,Fresh,"The characters are irresistible, the animation is astonishing and the film, a fantasy version of a foodie rhapsody, sustains a level of joyous invention that hasn't been seen in family entertainment since The Incredibles."
1,Rotten,"One of the blandest, most nervous and most cluttered fairy tale movies that Disney has ever released -- Bill Condon's redo is a rococo La La Fantasyland, complete with sort-of dancing and autotuned singing."
0,Fresh,"An appealing piece of fluff for movie buffs, and sometimes that's just good enough."
1,Rotten,"All told, this Shaft is one bad mother - and not in the way we'd hoped."
0,Fresh,"From Jett's groundbreaking recordings with the Runaways to how she defied a narrow-minded media establishment, ""Bad Reputation"" is a case study in how a musician stays relevant."
1,Rotten,[A] clumsy family comedy.
0,Fresh,"Supported by Tyson, Hopkins and Holyfield's personal journey, Champs delivers a deep analysis of boxing not only as a sport but also as a key social element of the American culture and its desperate need for improvement."
0,Fresh,"Michel Gondry's latest endeavor reads like a twisted storybook, weaving realistic tropes with fantastic visions of both the intensely light and the intensely dark."
1,Rotten,The plot gets unnecessarily complicated... and the movie takes a trip into noir territory that doesn't fit with the earlier established tone.
1,Rotten,"A skeletal summary, designed to entertain everyone but pleasing no one. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Wacky enough to make us smile but never laugh out loud, this screwball comedy harks back to those nutty 1970s farces Woody Allen used to make about a group of neurotic urbanites."
1,Rotten,What we get in Analyze That are several talented actors delivering their familiar screen personas in the service of an idiotic plot.
0,Fresh,"The additions are okay; but it's the look that keeps you buoyed up, your eyes roaming the frames, laughing in surprise at the visual jokes and flourishes and textures. It's a dandy's movie, but that adds to the fun."
0,Fresh,Awe-inspiring documentary about the history of big-wave surfing.
0,Fresh,"Faults and all, The Next Three Days is a pleasant surprise this fall -- a thriller that moves us while steering clear of the action cliches."
0,Fresh,"The film is always interesting and sometimes compelling, and it contains more actual provocative thought than any American film on race since Do the Right Thing."
1,Rotten,"Against the rest of his dramatically flimsy crew, Snipes' sunglasses-at-midnight strut conveys an almost lifelike sheen. Almost. He's more alive than the movie, which is dead on arrival."
1,Rotten,A visually stimulating rendition that nevertheless comes off as lamentably timid.
1,Rotten,"No amount of Downey swag can distract from the fact that this is film is just 'okay', wearingly predictable despite the potential for so much more."
1,Rotten,"Satan gets behind The Last Exorcism in a fiendishly clever plot that starts out creepily enthralling, then collapses in a heap."

1,Rotten,"The film is fine, familiar fare for gamers and children: Sonic sprints, Carrey mugs, but the creative juices run out quickly."
0,Fresh,"Strongly acted and beautifully photographed (by Virgil Mirano), ""Spoken Word"" is a quietly resonant family drama about the tug of old habits and the difficulties of escaping the past."

0,Fresh,"A peculiar film, one both steely and delicate."
1,Rotten,"Some will find [Jarmusch's] excavation intriguing. The rest of us may long for the enticements of meaningful dialogue, character, and story, and a compelling film hero to make it all feel worthwhile."

0,Fresh,"If The Confirmation ties things up too easily, it still creates a nice sense of place and a fine showcase for an underrated actor. For some movies, low-key is enough."
0,Fresh,The scariest clown movie you see this year is a documentary.
0,Fresh,There are simply too many marvels to tally.
1,Rotten,It lacks the substance to sustain its feature-length running time.
1,Rotten,"A weak-tea version of ""Vertigo"" in which contrivances abound."
0,Fresh,"An inspirational, upbeat parable about the tenacity of the human spirit."
0,Fresh,...[an] astoundingly gripping conspiracy thriller...there is an unblinking complexity about the socio-political climate that smothers this fetching African campus
1,Rotten,"Although the effects were fun, I kept asking myself: ""Would I like this movie if it were in 2-D?"" The answer was no."
0,Fresh,"It falls apart near the end, but does so in such a fun way that it's still every bit as exciting and entertaining."
0,Fresh,It's a mind-blowing experience that makes you sit back and simply gape in awe.

0,Fresh,"OK, it would never happen. But if you ignore that, The Closet is a lot of fun."
0,Fresh,"It's rich with lively and revealing interviews, especially with the larger-than-life Battaglia. But it's also about the reign of terror that the Sicilian mob held over Palermo and other nearby towns, such as Corleone, for hundreds of years."
0,Fresh,Sin City gives sin a great name -- it's never been more plentiful or looked so gorgeous. What a visually stunning film this is.
0,Fresh,It's not a crime to make a sentimental film - it's a viable genre and sensibility - so there is much to commend A Man Called Ove for amid its calculating machinations.
0,Fresh,The Phantom Menace proves that Lucas still knows how to capture the imagination of young and old.
0,Fresh,[Director] Lapica displays a nice flair behind the camera giving the film a polished leg-up on the usual dry melodrama.
0,Fresh,A fascinating account of an agonizing creative process.
0,Fresh,"It's pretty regular in terms of plot and story - the kind of thing we've seen many times before, though usually with less likable actors and without all the dirty jokes."
1,Rotten,It goes from being wildly over the top to trying too hard to not trying nearly hard enough and back again. It's a fun but easily forgettable movie.
1,Rotten,"Not even the promise of ownership of a small Caribbean island could entice Academy members to vote for this dismal dud (then again, following the absurd bestowing of 11 nominations on the ridiculous Joker, I wouldn't put anything past them)."
1,Rotten,"Working under the incorrect assumption that anything having to do with porn is hilarious, Bucky Larson is a consistently strained comedy without much charm or wit."
0,Fresh,"A soothing, attractive film to watch."
1,Rotten,"Save your time, save your money, save your soul. Stay at home."
1,Rotten,"The climax features a dandy battle, but getting to it requires sitting through nearly two hours of posturing and pontificating."
1,Rotten,"I really, really wanted to like this movie. But some things are impossible."
0,Fresh,"Parnassus is an eye-popping fairy tale, a timeless tale of good battling evil and Gilliam's first film in a long while that wholly captures his vaudevillian spirit."
1,Rotten,Uneven adaptation of lyrical novel.
0,Fresh,Pays homage to Michael Cimino's 'Deerhunter' in evoking high tension from a game of Russian roulette.

1,Rotten,Garbage. Total garbage.
1,Rotten,"Feels slightly off-key, out of focus."
1,Rotten,We never get a critical sense from Allen that this movie was worth making in the first place. It's a work of habit more than inspiration.
0,Fresh,"An extraordinary rumination on memory and privilege while also being one of the most incisive movies ever to directly address-in moral, philosophical and personal terms-what it means to be a filmmaker."
0,Fresh,The film is one that families will enjoy discovering and experiencing together.
1,Rotten,The film never really gathers suspense and tension.
1,Rotten,"Everyone from boat-tour guides to shot-bar patrons find time to ask our hero solicitous personal questions. If only he, or the film, had more interesting answers."
0,Fresh,...the movie grows sweetly affecting.
0,Fresh,Filmmaker Wayne Wang follows Maid in Manhattan and Because of Winn Dixie with another dollop of harmless entertainment.
0,Fresh,"Writers like Mark Helprin give us comfort in our search. Mr. Goldsman's best quality might be his understanding of this subtle point -- even if his movie is, at times, rather less than subtle."
1,Rotten,"It is an exercise in pure cynicism, with little respect for its subject -- or for its thriller plot, which I defy anyone to explain."
1,Rotten,Such touches around the edges matter little in a movie that just isn't there.
0,Fresh,"This movie is not very interesting, imaginative, engaging, or exciting, but at least it avoids being too sugary."
1,Rotten,"Unbroken should feel like a horror movie (I can't imagine a more frightening existence than Zamperini's time in the prison), but instead feels like a pedestrian, gussied-up biopic."
1,Rotten,"Formulaic stuff that strongly recalls The Devil's Nightmare, another finger-wagging lesson in reaping what you sow wherein a busload of tourists dies for their sundry sins."
1,Rotten,"Little of the dramatic material is convincing, in part because Pitt retains a kind of preening inwardness far removed from the matter-of-fact authority associated with, say, Lee Marvin."
0,Fresh,"Disgusting, pretentious, anxiety-inducing, breathlessly bold and unforgettable."
0,Fresh,It's the work of a director firmly in control of his subject and shows that - when he wants to - there are few subjects that he can't tackle with flair.
0,Fresh,"Even if you've absorbed all the DVD/Blu-ray supplementary materials and read comprehensive books like Alien Vault, there's stuff in this doc that will probably be new to you."
0,Fresh,"If you can look beyond the polemics, this is also a powerful story about the emotional pain and psychological trauma that splits families and breaks hearts."
0,Fresh,"As compelling, intimate and brutally realistic an account of men at war as you've ever seen."
0,Fresh,"Better, more memorable action might have made this movie a real winner."
0,Fresh,"Filmmaker Natalie Erika James, pushes the unsettling sub-genre of intergenerational trauma forward with ""Relic,"" her haunting feature-length debut about watching a loved one lose their grip on reality."
0,Fresh,"Better than it oughta be, but not much more than a wacky character sketch."
1,Rotten,"Sweet gentle Jesus, did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history?"

0,Fresh,An insightful look into one individual's struggle with government information policy that has much wider implications.
1,Rotten,"Hopelessly inert, even as it hops between modern, trendy Shanghai and rural 19th-century Hunan..."
1,Rotten,"The Village reminded me not so much of Hitchock but Scooby Doo. When at the end of that cartoon it was revealed that glowing skull creature was actually Old Mr. Higgins the caretaker, it pissed me off even as a little kid."
1,Rotten,A forgettable trifle about a struggling breakfast TV show.
0,Fresh,Daring and different but just way too dark.
1,Rotten,Liberato muddles through a heavy-handed Christian agenda and barely legible plot.
1,Rotten,"Breakfast on Pluto dishes out some inspired ideas and brazen performances but as a whole, it's an unwieldy meal."
0,Fresh,"Although the plot ""twists"" somewhat derail the narrative and send the picture into a tailspin, credit must go to Smith for providing plenty of surprises. Red State is not so much scary as it is shocking, but shocking it most definitely is."
0,Fresh,"The enormous cast is a total delight, starting with Pfeiffer, with hair dyed dark, a New York accent and a continuously nervous edge."
0,Fresh,"An all-star cast that includes Jamie Foxx, George Lopez, and will.i.am keeps this colorful adventure moving -- but the jokes and set pieces never really soar."
1,Rotten,Any chance at building tension is quickly lost when whatever predicament the family finds itself in is wrapped up in the blink of an eye.
0,Fresh,"A heavily-armed, solid thriller directed with style by Espinosa, who takes us supermarket shopping at the eye level of a child."
0,Fresh,"It's not the best Woddy Allen film, but at least its entertaining enoguh by commercial cinema standards. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"A great human document, deeply moving, unforgettable."
0,Fresh,"The parts of ""Isle of Dogs"" with the dogs are so wonderful that I still recommend the film. I just wish he had taken as much care and attention with his human puppets."
1,Rotten,We appreciate the cast and Zackham's attempted avoidance of cliche. Too bad it's just not very funny.
0,Fresh,"Like many of Almodovar's films, this one is emotional and personal. I think this film appeals to an older audience with its story about reconnecting with one's emotional center, after suffering despair brought on by age and medical problems."
0,Fresh,"One of several of writer-director John Sayles's masterpieces -alongside such unforgettable films as ""City of Hope,"" ""Matewan"" and ""The Secret of Roan Inish"" - ""Lone Star"" is an absorbing neo-Western mystery told in a haunting magical realist tone."
0,Fresh,"Damon and Colin Ford as his teen son have an affecting hesitancy, their hearts hovering between the living and the dead."
0,Fresh,A bittersweet musical with scenarios that suppurate a vintage aura inspired by classic Hollywood and with the brilliant performances of Gosling and Stone. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"This kind of film requires us to be very forgiving, and if we are, it promises to entertain. Angels & Demons succeeds."
1,Rotten,It might have been effective as a short film.
1,Rotten,"By no means is this a good movie, but it's warmed by the solar energy of its star, who surely deserves better than this formula empowerment flick."
0,Fresh,The characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films.
1,Rotten,Flicka is a classic tearjerker but may be a little too old-fashioned for its own good.
1,Rotten,The original is at least kitschy fun. So rent that before you even think about spending $40 for the family to see this.
0,Fresh,"It's a promising debut for Bhm, with a lot of promise. But it's a home run for Powley, who makes ""Wildling"" worth watching even when it shouldn't be."
0,Fresh,"Mildly entertaining and gorgeous to look at, 47 Ronin has little beneath the surface to recommend it. There are a few good fights, though."
0,Fresh,"Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson keeps the action swift and the tone light, but the movie lacks both the subtle grace notes and compelling characterizations that would make it a richer viewing experience."
0,Fresh,"Confusing panache and show-off dialogue slows the blastoff, but this escapist journey turns into high adventure with a rather special style."
0,Fresh,An engagingly screwball comic vehicle in which the actor and Tenacious D frontman goes through an inventory of heavy-metal moves and makes a mockery of them at the same time.
1,Rotten,"Long before these came up on screen, however, Unbreakable had defined itself as a big disappointment."
1,Rotten,"Tom Cruise is no longer cool, a truth he just can't face -- if he could, he'd be cooler."
0,Fresh,"Though Sausage Party is above all else a carnally inclined cartoon, there is more to the movie than just being Pixar with a potty mouth."
1,Rotten,"You can't blame the stars, who after all these years go together like, say, love and marriage. It's just that the script, which Ozon adapted from a play, is lightweight and better-suited to stage than screen."
0,Fresh,"For once, that thundering soap-opera music (which makes a Douglas Sirk movie score seem subtle) is welcome; it drowns out any embarrassing audience sniffles."
0,Fresh,"So precise, so hilarious, so biting, so smart, so perfect, in every one of its minute details that it comes as a sort of godsend."
0,Fresh,"Intelligent and uncompromising, with knock-out performances from Downey Jr. and Foxx."
1,Rotten,This is a horrible film.
0,Fresh,"There's no glory in this war, just shocking and horrifying deaths, and survivors damaged by experiences they can't even articulate."
0,Fresh,"Jamie Bell and Danielle Macdonald turn in solid performances in this film focusing on racism, hatred and white supremacy. Skin leaves us wondering that even though the appearance has changed...what happens to your heart? Vera Farmiga is stellar!"
0,Fresh,Vikings vs. aliens -- Outlander is probably the best possible version of whatever movie you've already made in your head from reading those first three words.
1,Rotten,"There are droll comic flourishes in this very brave film, to be sure, but all you really want to do after watching CSA is hang down your head and cry."
1,Rotten,"As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum, not even Ms. Redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality."
1,Rotten,"There's a slight commentary on suburban versus rural America, but returning English director David Bowers favours icky mayhem and genial rapprochement"
1,Rotten,Kids under 6 will dig it -- though the alligators and wildebeests might scare them. Certainly they scared this groan-up.
0,Fresh,Hilarious and filled with wonderful characters and situations.
1,Rotten,"This cop comedy is charged with an inane script, an unrealistic setup and brutally unfunny gags."
1,Rotten,"""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" falls into the politically impotent sub-genre of lightweight satire of which ""Charlie Wilson's War"" and ""The Informant"" are recent touchstones."
1,Rotten,"Regrettably, the film's story is so busy yet flat that the effect isn't magical -- it's more like watching the tale of some very enchanted wallpaper."
1,Rotten,"Feels like an afterthought, a trial-and-error effort in the search for the ideal Owen Wilson solo vehicle."
0,Fresh,Any punk fans should be grateful.
0,Fresh,"It does well, but not brilliantly: an amusing trifle from a studio whose best work still lay ahead of it."
1,Rotten,All the exhibits come to life after dark. That's about it. Aimed at kids.
0,Fresh,"A world gone mad, shaped from fear, chaos, cronyism,toadyism and limitless corruption. It's not the present day."
1,Rotten,"This is the kind of movie that isn't even worth renting when it comes out on video because, with the possible exception of Michael Lerner and Omar Epps dancing to show tunes, you've seen it all before."
1,Rotten,"If, as Fincher has said, this movie is supposed to be funny, then the joke's on us."
1,Rotten,Jack Goes Boating reminded one woman I spoke to of Rocky; I can see it if I squint.
1,Rotten,Life of the Party suggests that the filmmakers might do well to return to comedy school for a refresher in how to avoid the kind of formula traps that tend to neuter comic potential.
0,Fresh,"If some of the symbolism is a bit top-heavy, Bergman's richly evocative contrasts of youth with age more than compensate, as does Sjstrm's majestic performance."
0,Fresh,"This is the final journey, and it perpetuates a theme of mortality. All the while, the duo poke at each other in Greece, and Greece is the word. A fun escape from the pandemic"
0,Fresh,"An intimate epic, Jonze's film is nearly unique among modern kid fare for its total lack of condescension to the core audience."
0,Fresh,"A brilliant, thought-provoking documentary."
1,Rotten,After about a half-hour it became very clear to me that Black had no real idea what his story was and didn't particularly care to find out.
0,Fresh,"Valkyrie offers something to filmgoers weary of excessive pretense, but not quite desperate enough to watch Jim Carrey flop around on the ground."
1,Rotten,There's no freshness in either the domestic scenes or the combat sequences.
0,Fresh,By placing this epic journey through Mary's eyes we understand the sacrifice as being more than just time and energy. Her choice to follow Jesus was a betrayal to her name.
0,Fresh,It's a film that I can't get out of my head: it keeps arguing with my reactions to it.
1,Rotten,"The result is disappointingly dull, the equivalent of buying sham weed. You wait for something to happen, but ... nothing."
0,Fresh,"Shot with clean, spare simplicity by the Dardennes' regular DP Alain Marcoen, this is a very simple work, almost prosaically so at times-as if Breillat wanted to purge the film of anything that wasn't strictly to the point."
0,Fresh,A formulaic movie can be lifted out of its built-in rut by making it look like it invented the formula. Almost everything works here.
0,Fresh,"51 Birch Street, like the best of the recent wave of personal documentaries, is both a compelling story and an eye-opening bit of social history."
0,Fresh,The Grand Seduction is a bit on the preciously twee side - there's a surfeit of boozy old codgers here - and lacks the whimsical enchantment which lit similar conceits... but overall it's entertaining enough.
0,Fresh,Among the best of the best action films.
0,Fresh,"Hollywood has come up with a solid movie about the exploit, with Stewart plausibly depicting the Lone Eagle. A lengthy colloquy with a stowaway horsefly is one of the very few false notes in a basically honest and stirring narrative."
1,Rotten,"Like the Puritans themselves, the movie shuns drama. It has too much moral virtue for jump scares."
1,Rotten,There's something icky about a life-threatening coma that serves no function except to engineer a meet-cute.
0,Fresh,"Full of wonder, charm and dragons not doubling as stand-up comics"
0,Fresh,It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants.
0,Fresh,"Up may be the first Pixar film about actual people, and for all of its computer-generated visions and 3D inventions it's always about human emotion and human experience."
0,Fresh,"Isn't likely to entirely appeal to Cronenberg's core fans (whatever that is at this point), but it's a richly rewarding -- and sometimes disturbing -- film in its own right."
1,Rotten,"Curtis hangs situation and character comedy on a homage to rock'n'roll. That would be fine if it were funny, but auto-pilot Curtis prevails."
0,Fresh,"Shrewdly hedges its bets about the value of it all, it is ultimately on the side of experimental music and art and their champions, no matter how eccentric. For that alone this brave little movie deserves an audience."
1,Rotten,"The creeping presence of horror-flick hokum not only robs the scares of their strength, it shatters the realism that the single-take format is trying to convey."
0,Fresh,"'Small Time' still closes the deal, thanks to that one indefinable selling point: star charisma."
0,Fresh,"To its credit focuses mainly on the warm-hearted human tale of the innocent superhero in a hard world, rather than on visual dazzle."
0,Fresh,"[Bujalski's] free-floating comedies of manners -- of rudderless young people who can't articulate their feelings to themselves, let alone others -- turn out to be shapely, cunning, and indelibly strange."
1,Rotten,"A comedy by Star Wars geeks, for Star Wars geeks. It's also pretty average . . ."
0,Fresh,"The funny, touching, and even a little bit profound biopic of the world's worst ever opera singer, and the ultimate evidence of the power of Streep."
0,Fresh,[A] wonderfully realized and surprisingly understated dark satire...
0,Fresh,Not since Bamboozled has a Spike Lee joint been this blunt and tightly rolled.
0,Fresh,"Overall, don't get a bad feeling about this. You may even laugh it up, fuzzball."
0,Fresh,"The use of flashbacks and forward is a bit whiplash, but it's a great story, recalling the Cold War era when politics had a chokehold on everything..."
1,Rotten,"The movie drones along uninvolvingly, as if it were erecting a monument, not telling a story."
0,Fresh,The comedy in The Ice Harvest comes in shades of dark and darker. That's my kind of humor.
0,Fresh,"It's hardly a threat to the antics of ""Naked Gun"" but it's a delicately wry take on the absurdities of bureaucratic life. It upends Zhang's resume wonderfully."
1,Rotten,"Because of how heavy they were laying on the agenda, it made me stop to question, alright, how much of this is accurate."
0,Fresh,"Happy Death Day 2U makes deliberate moves away from horror, adding both science fiction and comedy to muddle the original mixture for better and also worse."
0,Fresh,"It's memorable for its subtle unconventionality - sad without being a weepy, touching without being a romance."
0,Fresh,It's a compelling story of how one disillusioned idealist helped change the world - and all for a Sony Walkman and some Queen cassettes!
0,Fresh,What do you call filmmakers who make literary entertainment box office in the age of Beavis and Butt-bead? Try miracle workers.
0,Fresh,"Other than perhaps being a little long in the tooth to have Colin Firth's character convincingly going gaga over her, Helen Hunt has done a decent job of directing a 'chick flick' which ought to be a hit with the distaff demographic."
1,Rotten,I admire Shyamalan's ambitions but Glass feels like several movies crammed and compressed into one and it almost always highlights the wrong movie at the wrong time.
0,Fresh,It shouldn't work - there's just too much going on. But it does. Spectacularly. Go see it.
1,Rotten,"(Run, Fat Boy, Run) is your nice, fun, romantic film that is not necessarily worth spending your money to see in theatres."
1,Rotten,"Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags, scattered moments of lazy humor."
0,Fresh,A film that exemplifies the popular artistic notion of inescapable tragic destiny.
1,Rotten,[I]t's all looks and no brain.
0,Fresh,"...a slick, slight, breezy affair that's easy to take if it's not taken too seriously."
1,Rotten,"It looks like Universal Studios had their script doctors work on this one, but clearly nobody could come up with the right prescription."
0,Fresh,Hiddleston steals the show with his ferret-faced grin and the shifty personality he instills in Loki.
1,Rotten,"Like many recent sword and sorcery movies, it is so effective in rendering evil, so good at depicting the dire, bleak fates facing the heroes, that it's too dreary and gloomy for its own good."
0,Fresh,"Good British sci-fis don't come along very often, so this stylish slice of a dystopian near-future should be welcomed by fans."
1,Rotten,"I reckon four out of every five jokes played to silence at the preview screening. If Dumb and Dumber To were a live comedian, he'd have said, ""Is this an audience or an oil painting?"" He'd have left the stage in tears."
0,Fresh,"And so we leave the cinema happy, our heads full of Gareth and gangsters-at-sea. Context, of course, is all."
0,Fresh,What we get is a larger metaphor about change that is as adaptable now to our current Commander-In-Chief as it is to many difficult transitions throughout history.
1,Rotten,"In the grand tradition of The Conqueror and Showgirls, Ashton Kutcher's first drama is funnier than his last three comedies put together."
1,Rotten,So what if he passes the Herculean he-man test the story puts him through? He still has all the sexual charisma of an untied shoelace. And even a woman who likes the soft touch can't do much with that.
0,Fresh,"Uncle Drew isn't a great sports comedy, but it's highly entertaining thanks to nailing the right tone and the chemistry of its leads."
0,Fresh,"The acting in this film is very good. The plot is lean and powerful. It is pretty depressing, but it seems true enough in its depiction of this troubled period of history."
1,Rotten,"This is a slapdash affair...that cops from everything from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" to ""Snakes on a Plane..."" the story is such a patchwork of other genre films it makes the act of watching seem like going through the motions."
1,Rotten,"Some fine performances can be found within this screwball, but it is largely dictated by an awkward tone and a testing languorous pace. For Capra completists only."
1,Rotten,"So unapologetically lowbrow, so proudly inane and incompetent that its shruggy attitude eventually becomes, in a sense, admirable, if you will."
0,Fresh,"A demented circus of obsession, greed, and Hollywood"
0,Fresh,There is good-natured British wackiness aplenty.
1,Rotten,"An empty exercise, a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance."
1,Rotten,"The payoff is a huge and telling visual howler, summarizing the entire plot with a blithe indifference that will inevitably mirror the audience's."
0,Fresh,"Parades so many smart, savvy strategies for avoiding the typical music-bio pablum that it's particularly dispiriting when the middle and end of the film so dully and incorrigibly embrace those very clichés."
1,Rotten,...we are expected to suspend our disbelief and accept that the adorable Kristen Bell needs some sort of crackpot magic spell to attract suitors.
0,Fresh,"It offers nothing new, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You don't hear people complaining that George Lucas is still making films about Jedi Masters and The Force, do you?"
0,Fresh,"Wedding Crashers may be the most optimistic Hollywood comedy of the year, because it restores at least some dim hope that directors, writers and actors with actual brains in their heads can somehow triumph over unimaginative studio execs."
0,Fresh,It's so-so stuff.
0,Fresh,[Depp's] a character audiences will follow anywhere -- even if it means plowing through the occasionally rough seas Dead Man's Chest navigates.
1,Rotten,A Clooney clunker. It's drab and disjointed with underwritten and underdeveloped characters.
1,Rotten,Clark's first film is memorable only for its catchy title.
0,Fresh,"A slow-burn tale of paranoia and familial obligation that does crawl out of the gate but crescendos in one satisfying ending. It may be small scaled in terms of setting and characters, but Lobo's debut is ambitious in effort ."
0,Fresh,"Body of Lies may not tell us anything we didn't already know about the way the US does business in the Middle East, but it's compelling nonetheless."
1,Rotten,"Sounds kinda like Mississippi Burning meets Steel Magnolias, doesn't it?"
1,Rotten,A visually-striking yet often ineffective sequel...

0,Fresh,This mesmerizing documentary about the cult musician (his enthusiastic fans include indie-rock royalty like Sonic Youth) will do more to sway the uninitiated to Johnston's side than away from it.

0,Fresh,Clint Eastwood is still relevant.
1,Rotten,"It can make you laugh and welcome the holiday spirit into your soul, unfortunately that's not all the overly-ambitious ""The Best Man Holiday"" tries to do."
1,Rotten,It's just a minor little film that you forget until the next Adam Sandler flick comes along.
1,Rotten,"Between bouts of gun fights and acrobatics, ""Aeon Flux"" is a dreadfully boring and incomprehensible mess with a screenplay that constantly jumps between clunky to just plain embarrassing..."

1,Rotten,"All of the red meat is just beneath the surface, occasionally poking through but mostly remaining buried."
0,Fresh,"(Michel) Piccoli gives a wonderful performance and is truly the film's heart and soul. I was also most impressed by how much of the Church's rituals, traditions and clerical garb (writer-director Nanni) Moretti gets right."
1,Rotten,The major reason this film ultimately fails is miscasting.
1,Rotten,"A slack chiller that sets sail with startling confidence, only to sink when it actually has to follow through on its ghoulish promises."
1,Rotten,James Marsden probably thought he could do no wrong after Hairspray and Enchanted. But he's unconvincing as the plot's inadvertent drug-taker who hallucinates his way through the movie. Ain't he the lucky one!
0,Fresh,"In fact, we think we know Mildred as a classic American movie type - a deeply wronged person on a relentless quest for justice. Because she is righteous, and because she is Frances McDormand, we are reflexively with her in this."
0,Fresh,A pretty effective string of action set pieces
1,Rotten,"The heart-tugging, done with enough torque to uproot tree stumps, even pulls in the movie's two best actors, [Ed] Harris and the semi-retired Debra Winger."

0,Fresh,"As much as anything, Bridge is about how powerfully friendship can transform children."
0,Fresh,"Tell Me Who I Am is a captivating look at two brothers and the grief they live with, and in this character study is a fascinating, unflinching look at love and forgiveness in the face of abject horror."

1,Rotten,"I enjoyed HAPPY ENDINGS, despite the fact that it uses several narrative devices I hope never to see in indie movies again for some time."
1,Rotten,"Hoping for franchise success by visual association with other movies, no matter how great the mimicry, steals too much heart and spirit from this beloved children's classic."

0,Fresh,"The big-screen Green Hornet, while hardly classic comic-book filmmaking, ain't half bad."
1,Rotten,"Gradually slips from awkward-funny moments to droll dawdling along. While overstaying its welcome by half-an-hour, it becomes clear this is another tale of bourgeois-white-girl-and-boy-who-can't-quite-commit. The charm wears off."
1,Rotten,"It wants to be a war-is-Hell 'coming home' story, but it ends up playing like a cheap action flick starring two men who are obviously too old to be running through the woods beating the living crap out of each other."
0,Fresh,"Moody and atmospheric, this German horror film plays on ancient legends as it recounts an old-world tale about a dark curse."

0,Fresh,The story needed a new twist.
0,Fresh,"Silly and scary, atmospheric and disjointed, I Trapped the Devil showcases Lobo's affection for the genre. He wisely avoids falling into the ""gore"" trap, instead relying on characterization and our fear of the unknown..."

1,Rotten,It's not so much a movie as it is another step in an ongoing marketing campaign.
0,Fresh,Yet another exemplary example of persistent filmmakers of conviction stepping in to exhume a suppressed black past - where US history and the dishonest education system fear to tread. And potentially ushering in a commendable Black Renaissance in movies.

0,Fresh,"It is a subversively thrilling treat to see the masterworks of art and cinema given the monkey business so expertly, the process enriching rather than lessening the stature of those works."
0,Fresh,"An underlying tension persists, but Second Coming has much more to offer from quiet drama to moments of grace, not least in the stunning quality of light and engrossing performances."

1,Rotten,Garry Marshall's romantic comedy delivers plenty of wish fulfillment without managing to offer anything remotely fulfilling.
1,Rotten,"It's far too long at 102 minutes, it doesn't follow through on any of its interesting ideas, it's never scary and, most unforgivably, it's boring. You can skip this one."
0,Fresh,"Coppola adapted the novel himself, and he's done a good job of paring it down."
0,Fresh,"We never quite recapture the sheer joy of the original, but it all builds to a strong finale."
0,Fresh,"Yes -- it's another frontier saga type, but the acting of James Stewart, Shelly Winters, Dan Duryea, and Stephen McNally lift it from the rut."

1,Rotten,Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is more of the same -- and yet less.
0,Fresh,"[Verbinski] and Steven Conrad hold their ground, sticking to their conviction that Dave's story should play as a belated-coming-of-age movie."
0,Fresh,A fun movie that you can lose yourself in for a little over 100 minutes and get a thrill and laugh or two along the way.
1,Rotten,"Charmless and shapeless, larded down with nonsensical action scenes, witless repartee and a ""plot"" stitched together by a committee of writers who've watched ""The Da Vinci Code"" too many times."
1,Rotten,"The film is padded out to a full two hours, which may not be quite as long as the dogs have to wait for their rescue, but it does feel like it."
1,Rotten,"I took a friend's 10-year-old daughter to see the film, and she found it 'too childish.' And who am I to argue with a member of this film's target audience?"
1,Rotten,"Here, the brothers weave an elaborate, misanthropic web of desperation and betrayal around a group of characters so jaded they take no real pleasure from their artless deceptions and sordid affairs. Imagine how we feel."
0,Fresh,"The directors were satisfied with telling us about a group of courageous, honorable young soldiers -- a salute these men richly deserve."
0,Fresh,"This film feels very authentic, like the viewer is peeking in on a real family trying to cope with a difficult situation. Part of that credit belongs to Payne's magnificent screenplay, but the cast is pretty special, too."
1,Rotten,"Had Fading Gigolo been nothing but its romance scenes, it still would not be entirely successful, because it's strangely muted. There is a quietude to the romance that subtlety plays up the emotional stakes, but keeps us from being fully invested."
0,Fresh,"Extremely violent, extremely preposterous, extremely entertaining, The Matrix succeeds at two extremely difficult tasks: as a vast, exciting virtual-reality movie and as a defibrillator for Keanu Reeves' big screen career."
0,Fresh,"The plotting is clever and the film, directed by Felix Herngren, is handsomely produced and nothing if not amiable, while the supporting cast - especially Mia Skaringer's warm-hearted Gunilla - is very good company."

0,Fresh,"Although it runs down an expected checklist, the movie is incredibly likable largely due to Leuenberger's shy, unlikely heroine."
1,Rotten,The movie does not live up to the extravagantly wounded ferocity with which Travolta attacks his part. It doesn't even live up to the haircut.
0,Fresh,"Cameron Smith finds redemption in Jamie Marks Is Dead, an unconventional paranormal story about accepting fate and moving on - no matter how the road ahead is paved."
1,Rotten,Another Resident Evil zombie film with no brains but plenty of over-the-top action should still sate the appetite of certain viewers.
0,Fresh,"Intentionally slick on the surface, ""Slash"" cuts deep, wringing laughs from the cringeworthy behavior of awkward teens, but also nailing the desperation to be understood."
1,Rotten,I like to imagine that Nicholas Sparks realized he couldn't write yet another prequel story about how the people whose photos come with the picture frames fell in love. So he figured he'd try a thriller!
1,Rotten,Director Tamra Davis and screenwriters Sandler and Tim Herlihy scatter the bad jokes like fertilizer. Nothing sprouts.
0,Fresh,"Berman's goal was to reveal ""the other side of Hugh Hefner that had not yet been portrayed in any of the prior documentaries about him."" In that context, the film's balance is appropriate; considered in a vacuum, however, it is almost a canonization."

1,Rotten,Much too precious to be believed.
1,Rotten,"If nothing else, deserves some kind of trophy for most bogus 'true story' ever filmed."
1,Rotten,"Like a degree in gender studies, there's no payoff."
0,Fresh,"Isn't as challenging as it imagines itself to be, yet its sophistication and interest in vulnerability is welcome in a genre that often avoids the subtle to go big with the boom."

0,Fresh,"[Tony] Gilroy directs with a cool hand and an underplayed sense of drama, letting the words and the performances carry the film."
0,Fresh,A potent legend of modern international relations.
1,Rotten,"When they are laughing and cooking, you are thinking, 'Racism will pop up any second now,' or 'T-Ray is going to show up'; it's an uncomfortable feeling."
1,Rotten,This movie ... doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is.
0,Fresh,"In the end, it's comedy comfort food, something powdered poured from a box."
0,Fresh,"A movie that means well and does no harm, only good. So there should be an audience for this mild, friendly little effort."

1,Rotten,Cop Out is a case study in how you can do everything right in theory and everything wrong in practice.
1,Rotten,A cobbled-together mess of conflicting tones.

0,Fresh,"While it might not feel as complete and well-rounded as the first movie, Sin City: A Dame To Kill For is a worthily prurient follow-up that offers up a whole bundle of new cinematic tricks, and a rogue's gallery of exciting new characters."
0,Fresh,"While the plot drives the sperm donor hijinx (an attempt to 'milk' Patriots QB Tom Brady, a Boston Police code 317, and MacFarlane upping the ante on the Farrellys with havoc at a sperm bank), it's a dead weight on the last two acts."
1,Rotten,"A film that, despite Plummer's powerful turn, proves too pulpy for its underlying theme about unpunished war criminals-as well as one that serves as a sad reminder of the heights that its director once reached."

0,Fresh,It seems impossible to think of anyone turning in as fine a performance as Ejiofor does here.
1,Rotten,"Slow-footed sentimental road comedy which Jeremy Irons, as a mean-mouthed Vietnam vet from Kentucky, almost makes worthwhile."
1,Rotten,"When we've all been spoiled prior with clever animation that mixes wit and whimsy with such ease, a product like Smallfoot can't help but feel a little ordinary."
0,Fresh,"Phillips' collaborators work in harmony with the natural, nuanced acting; credits across the board are stylish and smooth, with lensing a standout."
0,Fresh,"National Treasure: the Book of Secrets is an absurd adventure, but its absurdity is wacky and warmhearted. You have to suspend your disbelief, but so what? National Treasure: the Book of Secrets delivers on what it sets out to be: lively and"
1,Rotten,"Land of the Lost is only one hour and 36 minutes long, but it could easily be 15 minutes shorter without the scenes of Ferrell's meandering ad-libs."
0,Fresh,It's unapologetically one-sided and aimed entirely at the converted; if you don't know your half-tortoise from your full-locust then Yogawoman is probably not for you.
0,Fresh,"The movie, directed by Field of Dreams helmer Phil Alden Robinson, feels a bit antiquated, with more '90s hallmarks than 21st-century touches."
1,Rotten,The unbearable and atrocious Midgets vs. Mascots can now be included in that select group of films that makes prostate exams seem appealing.
0,Fresh,A well-executed spy-thriller.
0,Fresh,"No sense kicking this thriller for plot holes and lapses in logic when the action, suspense and flirty sex come at such a lively clip."

1,Rotten,"One would think an animated Sandler would be less repellant than live action -- at least you wouldn't have to actually 'see' him -- but surprise! Even (cheaply) drawn, he's actually more unbearable."
0,Fresh,"The visceral excitement of ""Wages of Fear"" combines with a sharp critique of ""Good War"" mythology. Brilliant filmmaking with a moral edge."

1,Rotten,"If an animated scattershot clusterfuck tweaking under the influence of a determinedly Japanese mindset sounds like a good way to substitute a cinematic drug experience for the real thing, then go right ahead to Satoshi Kon's overflowing excess."
1,Rotten,"In an attempt to follow National Lampoon, it was the first and only film produced by MAD Magazine. One viewing reveals why."

0,Fresh,"Spectre wants to operate as both a grim post-9/11 thriller and a throwback spy yarn, and it succeeds often enough. There's something audacious about positing a massive security and civil liberties threat right in the heart of central government."
1,Rotten,"Alan Rickman was born to play the Sun King -- or any king, really -- but neither he nor the blue-chip cast he's recruited in his capacity as director can rescue this muddled historical drama."

0,Fresh,It is filled with the stand-up-comic-turned-auteur's lunatic brand of humor and the inventive use of wild violence that first brought him widespread acclaim.
1,Rotten,"Non-super things made super isn't a new aesthetic, but it's at its most shameless in Robin Hood, superimposing raw essential parts stolen from Batman's background upon its source material."
1,Rotten,I love a good action film and dig a sustainable franchise. Terminator: Dark Fate really isn't either of those.
0,Fresh,A sterling example of the new Australian noir.
1,Rotten,Jon Watts does nothing with the scarily funny notion of a respectable professional who suddenly refuses to shuck a party costume.
1,Rotten,"At times, the movie looks genuinely pretty. Your nightmares, on the other hand, will be anything but. Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow."
0,Fresh,Kim Jee-woon's riff on the western is an entertaining frolic back-loaded with gore and guffaws. Arnie's back!
1,Rotten,"It's telling that the most effective scenes in the film are simply Alita, alone, staring at herself in a full-length mirror."
1,Rotten,"In its own polemical way, it is very powerful filmmaking but, as storytelling, it is one-dimensional. There is too much ""docu"" here and not enough drama."
0,Fresh,The primary improvement over the first film ... is that this one is simply more enjoyable with less heavy lifting.

1,Rotten,"This family-friendly drama may be inspired by a 17th-century book of the same name by the visionary astronomer, but the movie ""Kepler's Dream"" lacks imagination."

0,Fresh,Hou Hsiao-hsien's first French-language film shows why the Taiwanese master is considered one of the world's great filmmakers.
0,Fresh,"The miracle of Hairspray is that it does exactly what it sets out to do. It takes the sassy 2002 Broadway musical translation of [John] Waters' most accessible film and brings it to the screen with energy, wit, sex, laughs, craft and unabashed fun."
0,Fresh,"There are still puke jokes in 'Adventureland' as there were in 'Superbad,' but it's nice to see that Mottola can help viewers get in touch with another body function, the beat of a heart."
1,Rotten,The complicated plotting gets increasingly ridiculous as the picture nears conclusion.

0,Fresh,There are few things more involving than watching someone sticking to their guns
0,Fresh,"The film feels like its only raison d'etre is to tie all the storylines and character arcs into big, flouncy bows, of the kind one sees on the back of a bejeweled 20s-era frock."
0,Fresh,Director Jerome Sable really creates a unique and genuinely raucous horror musical that takes Phantom of the Opera and builds a very refreshing revenge story from its roots.
0,Fresh,"Rocketman  is a cannily honed machine, absolutely sure of its purpose, so you rather feel you've been sold a complete deluxe package... at times, consumer satisfaction is taken care of a little too aggressively for you to really feel involved."
1,Rotten,"Sigh. Folks. It's 2016. I mean, seriously. Aren't we past these pathetic stereotypes by now? Can't we move away from these ridiculous disability as tragedy storylines?"

0,Fresh,"Without [Blanchett], Kapur's extravagant history lesson (written by Michael Hirst) blurs into dark doings among men in tights."
0,Fresh,The writers know these characters -- the believer seeking the truth no matter how outlandish; the religious skeptic with her own rock-hard belief in science -- and the actors step into their roles without missing a beat.

0,Fresh,"The Lego Movie is an intricate piece that delights in both celebrating and mocking movie archetypes, the commercialisation of childhood experience, and the authoritarian hands of parents."

0,Fresh,Cosmopolis is Cronenberg's first movie since Videodrome to not only identify a particular zeitgeist but embody it in form and content.
0,Fresh,Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho set the standard and post-modern horror has been hobbling to catch up ever since.
1,Rotten,"Concentrating as much on the detectives investigating the case as on the killers, Lonely Hearts fails to show off its impressive cast at their best."
1,Rotten,"Part of the problem does lie in DeVine himself, who is relied on too heavily by the script and is present in essentially every scene."
0,Fresh,A magnificent picture because it specifically goes out of its way to avoid the clichs and elements would usually expect to see when watching this kind of boy meets girl movie.
1,Rotten,Unsettling but tedious
0,Fresh,"The set pieces are beautifully handled, grizzled veteran Ben Johnson is watchable as the head cop on their tail, and, looking back, it's clear that Spielberg already held all the aces and knew how to deal them."
1,Rotten,"A certain level of grotesquerie in a children's entertainment is essential, but at some point grotesquerie is just. . . grotesque."
1,Rotten,"A gonzo, garish mash-up of ""Clockwork Orange/Blade Runner"" and ""Streets of Fire."" A mess, but you've never seen anything like it."
1,Rotten,The camera's ability to privilege the perspective of its wielder has rarely been abused as blatantly as it is in this film. This is a singularly self-serving work.

1,Rotten,The Ice Storm warmed over.
1,Rotten,...the subject matter of fugitive war criminals in the former Yugoslavia doesn't mix well.
0,Fresh,"Kelly captures, better than any film in recent memory other than Election, what it feels like to be in high school."
0,Fresh,"The comedy is often crass and crude, but it makes telling points about how much of 'race' is more about the words and gestures we use than the actual colors of our skins."

1,Rotten,"I'll give Stone credit for capturing the craziness of Kovic's life, but he fails to give a human face to his free fall."
1,Rotten,"The movie crushes its characters under its foot, then steps back and wants you to look at the mess and admire it."
0,Fresh,A film that seems predictable until it manages to portray complex concepts in an exceptionally elegant way. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,A version of the mid-Lancastrian period in English history that's dramatically effective on its own terms as a commentary on the inevitability and futility of war.

0,Fresh,Cinema Verite turns into quite a powerful film when it's able to air the complexities and implications of a story that TV originally left out.
1,Rotten,"Be Kind Rewind, while erring just this side of too adorable for its own good - it's nothing if not enjoyable for once again showcasing Gondry's ingenious guerilla filmmaking tactics - is still a bit of a setback."
0,Fresh,Rib-ticklingly funny at times and genial as all get-out.
0,Fresh,"To describe Foxx's performance here is to gush, and so gush we will."
1,Rotten,Humbug. American families deserve a better effort than this.
0,Fresh,"About Schmidt belongs to Nicholson. Gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances. As Schmidt, Nicholson walks with a slow, deliberate gait, chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance."

0,Fresh,"The cast radiates integrity and intelligence, none more so than the superb Ruffalo."
1,Rotten,"7 disappoints a little because it doesn't go off the rails enough, especially in comparison to the last two movies."
1,Rotten,"McConaughey has never really found his niche as a movie star, occasionally scoring in an adventure film, but lumbering through a series of romantic comedies to no good effect."
1,Rotten,"The legendary rockers never did much for me musically, and so a film that's 95 percent live performance does even less."
1,Rotten,"There's fertile soil for comedy here, if Dan Lansmann were written as anything other than a lying, narcissistic, windbag sociopath."
0,Fresh,the most interesting people are no longer related to Darth Vader

0,Fresh,Both a celebration and an indictment of the American political system.
0,Fresh,"Although its humor is not for all tastes, no one can say this crazy picture doesn't have the guts to live up to its title."
0,Fresh,"Wow, this movie is totally insane."
1,Rotten,"It feels like Jumper might have been longer at one point, then had everything but the action scenes removed. What plays on the screen is therefore an empty, hollow shell of a film that keeps you at arm's length."
0,Fresh,"Mr. Zahn brings feeling to an often-cliched role, while Mary Lynn Rajskub is moving as a troubled woman who almost connects with the similarly confused Norah."
0,Fresh,"The film's deliberate color palette and tightly choreographed, perfectly timed sequences recall Jacques Tati. But there's an irreverent, off-center humor here that's distinctly their own."
0,Fresh,Refreshingly short on cuteness and remarkably alert to the problems inherent in adapting a much-loved novel to the screen.
0,Fresh,It's with great pleasure that I proclaim the Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah-directed Bad Boys for Life is the best Bad Boys since the original.
0,Fresh,"If the film came across as jaded and cynical, it might well be hard to take. Instead, it seems weary and defeated, as if some people are simply born to fail."
1,Rotten,The sense that a lot of these characters have been reduced to their narrative purpose destroys the world that Burden needed to create to work.
1,Rotten,A bit of a dull jumble.
0,Fresh,Tries too hard to depict its main character as an adult in a boy's body. At times it almost feels like Big or Freaky Friday

0,Fresh,"It needs only to entertain. And that it does thoroughly, leaving us both charmed and enriched without feeling very preached at. Praise be."
1,Rotten,An innocuous but haphazard family comedy that seems less crafted for children than dreamed up by a team of them.
0,Fresh,"Vale la pena verla, por supuesto, pero mi mejor recomendación sería ver (antes o después) la versión sueca. Puede ser incluso un interesante ejercicio de comparación..."
0,Fresh,The Producers has some great comic writing by Brooks to help offset the movie's many problems.
0,Fresh,"Pratt's charm and presence go a long way to carry the film through a confusing first act bogged down in character introductions, back story and set-up."
1,Rotten,... as dull as watching somebody else play an incoherent video game ...
0,Fresh,"The picture... can't be said to break any new ground in the gritty, mean-streets genre. But it has a better-than-average cast and a few clever plot twists, and it ends up being an occasionally amusing time-killer."
0,Fresh,"While it looks done on the cheap, it's effective; who knew the classic 'cabin in the woods' could be reworked as the chatroom online?"
0,Fresh,Essentially a character study of one of the seven deadly sins...
1,Rotten,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 might be the most beautiful and well made bad film in history.
0,Fresh,Tells the story of the Exodus for a new generation and does it in spectacular style.
0,Fresh,"It is mesmerizing at times, repetitive at times, and most revealing when it separates the Adolf Hitler the world knew from the private Hitler."
0,Fresh,"Somehow, Lumet and his expert cast are able to make his shady characters compelling even though these folks might pause for only a passing thought before stabbing each other in the back, literally."
1,Rotten,"May be a marginal improvement on its predecessor and source material, but at a brain-stabbing 140 minutes, it still reaches levels of tedium that are hard to conceptualize."
0,Fresh,Real Genius shows that nerds have their own games. They don't need to run faster or get more pledges or give themselves makeovers to have fun and prove their worth.
0,Fresh,"Conveys the stultifying mechanics of human labor through sheer repetition, while aspiring to subtle moments of insight rarely captured in movies, as to how work comes to define who we are and how our lives play out on the planet."
0,Fresh,"A beautifully twisted, slow-burning psychothriller that may or may not all be taking place inside India's head, Stoker marks South Korean cult director Chan-wook Park's inaugural English language venture."
1,Rotten,"Comes off as a fabrication of reality created by the Hollywood cash factory, and appears to be in pursuit of nothing nobler than big summer box office returns."
0,Fresh,"While it doesn't have the most original themes in a kid friendly film, there's still enough classic macabre ""Addams Family"" antics to help entertain the casual viewer and perhaps win over a new generation of fans in the process. Snap. Snap."
1,Rotten,What's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour. Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough.
1,Rotten,"Been there, done that."

1,Rotten,I found it to be all style and glitz and very little substance.

0,Fresh,"Takes cues from '70s horror movies, but ... creates its own creepy atmosphere."
1,Rotten,"There is certainly some entertainment value to be had here, but a movie that lacks earnestness has a licence to be fun; Ritchie never once properly takes that chance."
0,Fresh,It's a simple premise that Allen complicates with an illusionist's expertise.
0,Fresh,"A century ago, World War I propelled history into an unseen state-of-the-art era of warfare, and now, 1917 closes out this current decade as a masterpiece that will thrust the genre into a brave new era."

1,Rotten,Movies like this are best enjoyed with your mind completely on autopilot.
1,Rotten,"Atchinson has a winning touch with his young cast, but he gets stung by the ethnic stereotyping and the one-dimensional portrayals by his adult leads."
1,Rotten,"While the visuals never rise above TV-movie adequacy and some background acting hovers at am-dram level, The World Unseen's central story is strong enough to hold attention."
1,Rotten,"This movie is so bad, you could shoot Garfield and even PETA would not object."

1,Rotten,"Lovely to look at, but ultimately a chore to endure."
0,Fresh,"What's really remarkable is how you'll forget this is a one-take wonder as the characters and story takes hold. Brilliantly engineered, coolly executed, Victoria is a triumph."

1,Rotten,"The fun of the idea in Cop 3 is the notion of a huge, corny, funny-animal park, with cops and killers running around in the tunnels. But the movie gets drowned in casual brutalism, lazy shtick and telegraphed jokes."

0,Fresh,"It loosens the shackles of a post-Pixar/post-Blue Sky animation landscape, where family entertainment must either be an emotional roller coaster or mindless slapstick."
0,Fresh,"The movie's actual horror imagery is pretty familiar... that familiarity, working in tandem with the movie's emotional realism and the fine, restrained performances from Mortimer and Heathcote, all give the creepiness a psychological weight."
1,Rotten,This half-throttle documentary might better be called The Fast and the Uneventful.
0,Fresh,"Its sepia-tinted bones are weathered, but spit-shined real nice, sporting an all-star cast and a gold mine of studio production value."

0,Fresh,"While not quite Crowe at his absolute best, it carries his humanistic imprint and benefits from a strong acting ensemble that keep emotions in check."
0,Fresh,"There's serious tension in BlackkKlansman's situation, and the film embraces the shifts in mood with shifts in filmmaking style that allow Lee to couch his arguments in a kind of shorthand history of Hollywood's treatment of race."
0,Fresh,The acting is stronger than ever in this fourth installment.
0,Fresh,a western/samurai monstrosity consuming itself
1,Rotten,"The special effects are rarely special. Bad movie practice looms large as characters have private conversations out in the open or worse again, narrate the action."
0,Fresh,This spoof of 1950s attitudes is also a witty commentary on 21st-century issues such as homeland security and illegal immigration.
0,Fresh,...a brilliant close to a chapter of filmmaking we will likely never see again in our lifetime.
0,Fresh,A wondrous feat of imagination.
0,Fresh,"Knockout visuals, a winning cast, and an irrepressibly feel-good vibe make this dazzling romantic comedy one for the ages."
1,Rotten,"Each new Bourne sells a new variation on skepticism, nihilism, and gloom, supposedly enlivened by director Paul Greengrass's hyperactive, overly edited, always indecipherable chases, explosions, and fight scenes."
1,Rotten,Director Steven Soderbergh tries too hard to force his tone on the material. There's already enough goofiness here.
0,Fresh,a better grindhouse tribute film and spaghetti western homage than his previous two movies combined
0,Fresh,"Clint Eastwood's first film as a director, and first investigation into the anxiety at the root of the Eastwood persona"
1,Rotten,"It looks great, but haven't we been here before?"
0,Fresh,this film could have been so much better with an R stamped to it.
0,Fresh,"The CGI isn't always a match for Leitch's ambition but when he scales things down the fist-fights fly - showcasing Statham's martial arts prowess, as well as Johnson's more blunderbuss approach."
0,Fresh,"...a fall-on-your-face, pee-in-your-pants screaming riot of wild racism, leering sexism and all-around grotesque intolerance...and believe it or not, it's on the side of the angels."
1,Rotten,"Sing is pleasant enough...but scrutinize it, and you'll find that it's neither very musically accomplished nor very funny. The tone is bright and colorful but still evinces a kind of joyless duty...[3D Blu-ray]"
1,Rotten,"The piece had better have something fresh to say. The Informers doesn't, nor does it seem to want to."
0,Fresh,"Man Up doesn't differentiate itself from the dregs of the genre as much as it might seek to but, in Bell's most modern of rom-com heroines, we've finally found a woman with whom many will chime."
1,Rotten,"It's a particularly precious form of art-house entertainment, well-acted but ultimately mawkish and forcibly odd, the indie-film equivalent of a Hallmark card."
0,Fresh,"If your idea of a good time is trying not to roll in the aisles with laughter and risk making a fool of yourself, then Scary Movie 3 surprisingly fits the bills."
0,Fresh,It dodges the pitfalls of message-heavy teen movies and skirts the spite of the dumb-and-dumber era it arguably helped birth. Add two innately loveable leads and you can see it takes some smarts to sell something quite this daft.
1,Rotten,There isn't nearly enough substance to sustain 90 minutes of a movie and before long it all begins to feel a bit repetitive.
0,Fresh,"Who Is Harry Nilsson is a worthwhile portrait of a genius who made beautiful music, and a case study for how to tragically, epically self-destruct."
0,Fresh,"Yes, outside of a dress, Tyler Perry is a powerful screen presence."
1,Rotten,"If it sounds awful in theory, it's even worse to see it acted out, on a wide screen with lots of close-ups of teary, badly-coifed movie stars backed by a treacly Eric Clapton guitar score."
1,Rotten,"... despite some harrowing encounters with storms and creatures, it ultimately feels waterlogged."
1,Rotten,"A confused muddle, with characters who often behave in ways that have no correlation to actual human behavior, and language that exists in order to prop up the agenda."
1,Rotten,"The two writers narrowly skirt scandal, unlocking each other's potential to scale new professional heights. But the film seems to skirt along with them, hanging on every word like a groupie too overawed to interject."
0,Fresh,"An experimental movie, a bit of an oddity that's also a strong calling card for actor-filmmaker Lonergan and gifted cinematographer Andrew Huebscher."
0,Fresh,"Ryan has found amazing depth and richness of colour and contrast in his journey across these states, from derelict shacks to palatial estates, oil fields to truck stops."
0,Fresh,"Religulous will almost certainly not change your opinion of Maher, but the film is exceedingly well-made, intriguing, and awkwardly hilarious."
0,Fresh,"It's about moments like the opening sequence where Dom is racing a car backwards and while on fire (and, umm, plenty of women in bikinis are watching)."
1,Rotten,"An addictive documentary that'll have you cheering and crying, then waiting for the director to jump out from behind your sofa and say it was all a big joke."
1,Rotten,"Nothing but the same material as The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year yet again, and this film is worse at it."
1,Rotten,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth and worst installment yet, is two and a half hours of paralyzing tedium, featuring another colossal waste of British talent and a plot a real witch couldn't find with a crystal ball."
0,Fresh,"It might be a little too early to start engraving golden men, but Zellweger proves as vital as ever in her most essential role."
1,Rotten,By the time THE tearjerking moment creaks around we refused to cry from sheer spite.
0,Fresh,"Don't be shocked if it encourages a tear or two along the way. Jones has crafted a rounded, weighty thrill ride, and I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up as one of the best pictures of the year."
0,Fresh,"Though free of the hyper-kinetic shooting style of Transformers maestro Michael Bay, the film is spiced by similarly fluid direction by Travis Knight who maintains the high visual standard of the franchise while clearly aiming at a younger demographic."
1,Rotten,"Old-time character actors Ganz and Frank Langella provide a few brief moments of pleasure here and there, but otherwise, this is a dud."
0,Fresh,"Thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. There are enough bullets to wage a small war, frantic hand-to-hand combat, and a ton of explosions."
0,Fresh,"Director Amber Fares finds a frankly astounding subject for her first feature-length doc, using the story of a few brave sportswomen to shine a bright headlamp on lives lived under occupation."
0,Fresh,"Christian films are often criticized for preaching to the choir, but this one intends to make that choir think deeper about what's being preached."
0,Fresh,"Downton Abbey is like a long - and good - episode, true to the essence of the series in tone, structure and adventures. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Yeah, it tells an important story. Just wish it told it in a more gripping fashion."
1,Rotten,This awkward adaptation of the stage play comes off as an acting exercise but little else.
0,Fresh,"Not only does Shooting Dogs have something worthwhile to say, it's also incredibly important. That cinema has dared to challenge the truth of the Rwandan genocide is to be celebrated."
0,Fresh,"The fluency of Mann's direction and the slow-burn chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei counterbalance the more ordinary, and not always involving, procedural elements."
1,Rotten,"There's nothing certain in life except death, taxes and ... that movies based on video games are going to stink. Cue BloodRayne."
0,Fresh,"An avalanche descends on a family of tourists and it's not even among the five worst things to happen to them on their cursed ski trip in Force Majeure, the blackly comic Swedish psychodrama from director Ruben Östlund."
0,Fresh,"It is a calm sort of dream, a serious work about love and truth and fraudulence and authenticity done with a mysteriously light touch."
0,Fresh,"While Sánchez's screenplay could have done with fewer subplots, his directorial debut remains eminently watchable. Just ensure that you're going in looking for more than a ghost story."
0,Fresh,Exponentially inspirational; Blue Ruin is a film that feels like intimate atomic fallout out from an event that radiates through the lives of two families. Filmmaker Jeremy Saulnier is irrevocably one to watch.
1,Rotten,"Terrible French horror movie has bloody violence, nudity."
0,Fresh,"The Searchers's reputation is so widely accepted that it's a surprise to discover that the film, and Wayne's character, are more complex than the reputation suggests."
0,Fresh,The Descent may be superior to other recent horror movies but it's all still just surface thrills.
0,Fresh,"By its end we are glad to see the last of most of its characters, but we will not quickly forget them."
0,Fresh,"Superbly constructed and passionately made, Room is the kind of rare indie jewel that only comes around once every few years."
0,Fresh,"Even if she skirts the big questions, Wuornos is a riveting presence -- affable and articulate one minute, twitchy and petulant the next."
0,Fresh,"Despite technical and story deficiencies, this is a film that's as well intentioned as its complex central figure."
0,Fresh,The sort of creepy movie that is perhaps best thought of as spooky fun -- and 85 years have not changed that.
0,Fresh,"Funny, touching and life-affirming."
1,Rotten,"Meditation as a countermeasure against a sinister mind-control conspiracy is a novel idea; too bad it's wedged into a rickety framework of numbingly conventional dramatic complications, half-hearted eroticism, and pervasive humorlessness."
1,Rotten,All these guys are funnier when they drink - which they barely do here.
0,Fresh,"Porno is a dirty and amusing film filled with good characters and a fun premise. Despite some hiccups in the script and inconsistencies in the success of some of the humor, it's an enjoyable little horror flick"
1,Rotten,The Wild Life starts with a shaky idea and goes downhill from there.
0,Fresh,"It feels realistic, well acted, and it captures the rhythms of daily life."
0,Fresh,"Call it a primer in film criticism and analysis, as well as a testament to Alfred Hitchcock's mastery of form..."
0,Fresh,...an erratically-paced yet consistently entertaining installment in a not-quite-great sci-fi series.
0,Fresh,This crowd-pleaser is sure to bring tears of joy and thanksgiving as the boundless human spirit reigns. Litondo and Harris have great chemistry and form the heart of this straightforward narrative. They both show...
0,Fresh,"Along Came a Spider is much like its star: methodical, smooth, unflashy."
1,Rotten,"Sadly, the gags and the spicy dialogue aren't funny enough to make this work and it's only when Timberlake and Kunis start letting their characters' respective guards down that the film becomes more involving."
1,Rotten,"Writer/director Robinson is anything but disciplined... and he's more inclined to just turn the camera on and let Depp do his thing. Which Depp does very well, but as talented and watchable as he is, even he can't completely save the picture."
1,Rotten,"Most of ""Mortal Engines"" is a wearying blast of CGI and genre-cribbing."
1,Rotten,The most half-assed lesson in tolerance this side of an after-school special.
1,Rotten,The always beguiling Radha Mitchell can't save this stunted procedural-horror combo.
0,Fresh,"There's slow and then there's Ana Lily Amirpour's ""The Bad Batch."""
0,Fresh,Hereditary excels at permeating a convincing environment of despair with first-rate horror.
0,Fresh,"When the film works, it works really well. It certainly doesn't hurt that it features Owen, an actor who's capable of making almost anything watchable."
1,Rotten,"Yes, the story is touching, but the movie generates more pity than anger. A mistake, once racism in the United States remains as rampant as ever. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"The heart of the film is in these stories, communicated by physically and psychologically wounded men, and why the telling of those stories is vital..."
0,Fresh,It's scary enough for suspense fans and gory enough for slasher fans.
0,Fresh,"Joyous, hilarious, and uplifting..."
0,Fresh,"Life is a paean to the lost days when matine idols were preserved in luminous black and white, in magazine spreads that allowed photojournalists to indulge in deep coverage for months."
0,Fresh,"An enjoyable, Kipling-esque adventure."
1,Rotten,Producer Sean S. Cunningham and cronies have wisely given up trying to scare us with this series.
1,Rotten,A film that leans so heavily on its stars that their performances are marred by their emptiness.
0,Fresh,"Yes, the film's clunky. Yes, it's dumb. But it's fashioned with such charm that it's also lovable, poignant and funny - one scene paying homage to ET had me in stitches."
0,Fresh,"""Good Boy!"" is rather fetching, especially for the small fry."
1,Rotten,"Tony Scott's loose remake of Sargent's 1974 film is mixed blessing: Helgeland's characterizations are deeper and sharper, but the film suffers from excessive stylistic flourishes and preposterous last reel."
1,Rotten,The low-budget film relies on character authenticity but ultimately requires too much suspension of disbelief.
0,Fresh,The cast exquisitely play the complete and complex characters with Chris Cooper at the top of his game.
1,Rotten,"Airy, pseudo-folkloric gibberish at best, Chocolat affects shrill agnosticism in the service of a disingenuous pro-tolerance rallying cry."
0,Fresh,"Though the arc of the story is fairly predictable, Brenda Blethyn and Sotigui Kouyate bring humanity to their roles."
0,Fresh,"When [director Can Evrenol] paints a panorama of shabby roadside bars and policemen who behave like lords and masters, it's fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"...if you just want the vicarious experience of watching two friends go out for meals together in splendid locations, this movie delivers plenty of that - and it looks absolutely lovely."
0,Fresh,"Along with films such as Luis Buuel's ""Los Olvidados"" and Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard,"" Joseph Mankiewicz's ""All About Eve"" made 1950 one of the most seminal years in cinema history."
0,Fresh,"Compared with the treacle and sentimentality that dominate most Hollywood movies about religion, the existence of this funny, gut-wrenching, thoughtful take on sacrifice and redemption feels almost like a miracle."
0,Fresh,"South African director Gavin Hood, who won a well-deserved best foreign language Oscar for Tsotsi,""knows how to turn the screws. There's more anxiety in four minutes of Eye in the Sky than there is in the entirety of Batman v Superman."
0,Fresh,"Riding Giants not only makes the audience care about a sport few of them have ever had the pleasure to participate in, it also effortlessly takes you along on its ride."
0,Fresh,Cinematic home cooking at its most savory.
0,Fresh,"Whatever the approach, the songs are sturdy enough to support it while remaining resigned and elusive, their words practically glowing in the dark."
0,Fresh,"...the pace is better, the action is not flooding the screen every two seconds, and characters seem more like evolved concepts rather than background distractions."
0,Fresh,"[Moana] is an excellent character with spirit, doubts, drive and a heck of a voice. She is a perfect addition to the roster of modern Disney heroines and one whom young girls will admire for years to come, princess or not."
0,Fresh,The Informant! was worth the weight gain for Matt Damon as he delivers what's easily his best performance to date.
0,Fresh,"A paint-by-the-numbers plot still leads to an entertaining picture in ""Breaking In."" Here, you get what you expect, but it's a little better than you may have anticipated."
0,Fresh,"The everyday moviegoer will find it as impenetrable as its heroine. But if you vibrate to nuances of style, if you enjoy tension gathering strength beneath terrible restraint, if you admire great acting, then you will."
0,Fresh,"In a world where simple black and white morality is popular, there are few Hollywood films, especially with this large a budget, that could ever tackle such complex thematic material."
1,Rotten,To paraphrase some hackerish blurb I just heard on the shill-y E! network: Must Love Dogs is in the doghouse.
0,Fresh,Jordan approaches his latest project as if it's a modern-day fairy tale -- while probably hoping that his audience is not too cynical to play along.
0,Fresh,The pitch might not be perfect but might appeal to fans of the franchise.
1,Rotten,"Rather sloppily blends melodrama and spiritual uplift with crass comedy, sometimes in the same scene."
1,Rotten,One of the worst films ever made.
0,Fresh,Captures the conventions and pretensions of fly-on-the-wall docus with wicked accuracy.
0,Fresh,...conventional yet compelling...
0,Fresh,The power of Stop-Loss -- and this is no dumb joke -- is that it shows its hero between Iraq and a hard place.
0,Fresh,"The end result is still stunning: A saga that's horrifying and funny and melancholy, sometimes in different scenes, sometimes all at once."
0,Fresh,"A whole lot of good, clean fun."
1,Rotten,"There's no reason why it shouldn't be both great fun and warmly human, but alas, it just isn't either."
0,Fresh,Few films parlay their assets so well... or reap such frightfully powerful rewards.
0,Fresh,"Thanks to its understated elegance and surpassing central performance, this modest, too-eagerly schematic period drama is more engrossing than it has a right to be."
0,Fresh,Both psychologically revealing and richly comic.
0,Fresh,Whatever the film lacks in refinements it more than makes up for with its genuine emotional currents and fine lead performances.
0,Fresh,So ferociously acted and executed that it practically takes a bite out of you. You won't believe how great it is.

0,Fresh,"The way in which all its vanishing points converge and fit, give relevance and weight to the fantastic climax. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"...funny, absurdist and disturbing."
1,Rotten,An overwrought experiment in cerebral slapstick that misses more targets than it hits.
0,Fresh,If you have the patience to give yourself over to the measured pace of this film ... it delivers with an impact far beyond what a conventional treatment of the same material could hope to achieve.
0,Fresh,Forget the silly plot; see this for the music.
1,Rotten,"Perry comes to ""Nobody's Fool"" with a newfound interest in being dirty, but he's not prepared to ditch his creative habits, making sure his new film plays just like all his other ones."
0,Fresh,"It's not as good as the last film, and it probably won't change any hearts-and-minds, but this third 'Purge' film remains a potent work of cultural criticism."
0,Fresh,"Partially shot in a real slaughterhouse, the film is visually and conceptually both beautiful and viscerally sickening, a fascinating exploration of loneliness and attention in an unusual environment."
0,Fresh,"Ferrell scores again in Blades of Glory, a comedy that would not seem to need making."
0,Fresh,"This film is far from perfect, but it made me and some other terribly frightened folks laugh for a while in the dark."
1,Rotten,"However lame and frustrating the screenplay - it is both - and however industrial the directing - very - 27 Dresses is not helplessly unappealing,"
0,Fresh,"Survive the Night is a straight-forward thriller where cliches abound. But despite an overly familiar plot, it remains an entertaining ride."
1,Rotten,The human interaction is just a little too precious and the digression away from the dogs and the main story is just too long for it to feel like anything but a major detour.
1,Rotten,Eye of the Holder makes you wonder how bad are the scripts that Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor turn down.
1,Rotten,The film has an extremely high gag rate - it's just a shame that so few of them actually work.
1,Rotten,Firth has always been adept at revealing shards of psychic trauma beneath a calm English defence; he has ample opportunity here as the gap between reality and fantasy stretches beyond breaking point.
0,Fresh,"The film hits us at a level deeper than most slasher films, and even as we are entertained by it, we are drawn in by its powerful suspense and implications."
0,Fresh,The name says it all. Campy entertainment.
0,Fresh,... Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House resonates today.
0,Fresh,"It's two-thirds of a great film but the slow start and unremarkable first hour hold it back. Still, for those who buy into the precept that ""good things are worth waiting for,"" The Walk unquestionably delivers."
0,Fresh,"A delicious trifle for anyone who has ever dreamt of bantering about the cinema with Luis Buñuel or lounging at the piano to hear Cole Porter sing ""Let's Do It."""
0,Fresh,Consegue retratar os sintomas da esquizofrenia de maneira particularmente eficaz graas ao brilhantismo de seu design de som e  atuao intensa de Greene.
0,Fresh,An indie triumph.
0,Fresh,"This amounts to entertaining summer diversion, to be sure, with solid, albeit actorly performances all around. But Webb's insistence on naturalism does not exactly add dramatic gravity to the story's more outré elements."
0,Fresh,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story meets expectations, the fears of thousands of fans can dissipate, this is a worthy product. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"But in the end, for a film that pretends to be anti-war, it comes across as ambiguous, which isn't anything new in the work of Samuel Fuller. [Full Review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,"Brash, abrasive and unrelenting, this is a must-see."
0,Fresh,"Scary, tense, atmospheric, and well acted..."
0,Fresh,"It's a small movie, but one that provides considerable food for thought, while being elevated by a performance from Woodard that, often without uttering a word, betrays an inner conflict that cuts to her very core."
1,Rotten,"Suffers from rambling, repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video."
0,Fresh,"...you can't help but be charmed by the cute trolls, the vivid, feelgood animation and the sweet, easy to follow, song-packed storyline."
0,Fresh,"A solid psychological thriller that could remind viewers of Ted Bundy, a cold, calculating psychopath who knew how to succeed with women."
0,Fresh,"Your heart will break, but it will also swell."
0,Fresh,A sequence that takes place in the famous Louvre museum is brilliant
1,Rotten,"Having sat through many a Fraser film, I am constantly amazed that there is nothing this boy can't do. Well, except act his way out of a paper bag."
1,Rotten,"While this could have been the perfect portrait of a certain kind of idiot, the baroque cruelties and tonal monotony go too far."
0,Fresh,"Layered conflicts mount as this lean film treks on, and they're not limited to gender politics."
0,Fresh,"Whatever its shortcomings, the film should be seen as a testimony to the true story of Jews who lived in a Belarus forest for years during the Holocaust."
1,Rotten,Aa movie that expects you to bring more to the movie than the movie brings to you...runs out of ideas long before it runs out of movie.
0,Fresh,"Based on André Aciman's 2007 novel, Luca Guadagnino directs a sexy, stunning film that will tunnel its way into your heart and live there."
1,Rotten,"The problem with Munich is that Spielberg has made a beautifully crafted, intelligent picture that raises some very complicated, and not easily dismissed, moral questions -- only ultimately to find the easiest way to dismiss them."
1,Rotten,"Connections are missing or scrambled between the filmmaking and the period, between the co-stars, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich, and between the characters they play."

0,Fresh,Its unique action scenes and the palpable chemistry of the lead actors continues to make this Marvel's most entertaining franchise.
0,Fresh,"Mr. King's script offers a wealth of behavioral details, notably in the conversations between Bob and Darcy, which put a deliciously perverse twist on conjugal familiarity."
0,Fresh,"It's a story both ecstatic and tragic, and Schnabel is more interested in the former than the latter."
1,Rotten,"The Rite is all windup, weak delivery."
1,Rotten,The Bond films were bad enough even with the partially ironic performances of Connery.
1,Rotten,Judge has put his movie together in a way that underplays everything and as a result rarely gets more than a chuckle.
0,Fresh,"At its heart, it's really just a one-idea premise stretched out to feature length, but the lovable duo of Tudyk and Labine and an endearing layer of sweetness under all the blood make it a fully enjoyable comedy of (t)errors."

1,Rotten,A misguided and often intolerable trainwreck...
1,Rotten,"Less funny than the last movie titled Mother's Day, and that was a violent horror film."
0,Fresh,This is a movie that just has a ton of imagination... It's an absolute spectacle.
0,Fresh,"There's ambition here, as well as a shaggy brilliance and a rare willingness on the part of a director to work out his questions in front of us, on film."
0,Fresh,It's exhausting but exhilarating.
0,Fresh,"The third act, though, is a blood-soaked, laugh-out-loud thrill-ride which makes amends for the film's somewhat laborious opening."
0,Fresh,It's anchored by an astonishing performance by Renee Zellweger in a comeback role for the ages that puts her way in front of this year's best actress Oscar race.
0,Fresh,Operatic and heartbreaking.

0,Fresh,A stylish and erotic Italian drama about the sensuous and sexual awakening of a middle-aged trophy wife.
1,Rotten,"Happy Death Day 2U is like watching a million ideas hit the screen at the same time, progressively moving itself to shakier ground before losing any sense of tonal comprehension or narrative necessity."
0,Fresh,"Though much has been made of the physical transformation Jake Gyllenhaal put himself through to look like a real boxer, Southpaw is a fairly standard, by-the-numbers boxing melodrama that hits all those beats we're accustomed to through the Rocky films."
0,Fresh,"Rocky returns from the long layoff with an outing that may please the mainstream, but lets down fans of the franchise."
0,Fresh,"The entire set was constructed indoors and it shows: the ""outdoor"" scenes are bathed in a dull gray light"

1,Rotten,Dumb sensationalism that trusts blood-buckets dumped on thesps are enough to raise a fright.
1,Rotten,The whole cast is hamstrung by a script that only runs Wikipedia-deep.
0,Fresh,"The Elephant Man is a perfect movie and, as John Hurt once said ""If you're not moved by the time The Elephant Man is over...then you're not someone I want to know."" I agree."
0,Fresh,"Silverman's comedy is ""adult"" in the usual sense - actually meaning juvenile - but it's also adult in its thoughtful, self-aware impiety, its disgust with hypocrisy."
0,Fresh,"Each of the principals in this character-driven tale possesses a solid, distinct personality."
0,Fresh,Not only does the truth set one free but also acknowledging unpleasant realities sometimes makes the platitudes seem like more than something off a locker room poster.
1,Rotten,"Director Gaspar Noé proved a shock poet in Irreversible. In Enter the Void, he's a shockingly tedious show-off."
0,Fresh,"Whatever you know about cloning, leave at the theater door. Whatever you know about the modern housewife, shuck that, too. The feminism of ""Multiplicity"" is barely circa 1959."
0,Fresh,Evocative and filled with magnificent sights and spirit...As wide-eyed and imaginative as its pint-sized heroine.
1,Rotten,The film has real compassion for its tabloid subjects but doesn't quite make the case for what was especially poignant or remarkable about this doomed love affair.
0,Fresh,Wonderful...a near-instant classic.

1,Rotten,"In taking a considered step back from this uncomfortably inconsistent effort, it remains difficult to fathom how this material got green-lit as a relatively large-scale Australian production."
1,Rotten,"Its density, ends up drowning a good part of the intention of a Gothic story. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"A violent cartoon that trivializes apartheid. If there's any justice, the birds of loneliness will be circling the box office."
1,Rotten,"Veteran director Roger Spottiswoode has tried to pep the old warhorse up, but the combined inertia of all those pictures over 35 years proves hard to budge."
1,Rotten,Let's call this what it is: a fetishistic After-School Special complete with closeups of trimmed pubes and squeaky-clean sphincters.
1,Rotten,"Unoriginal and unfunny, Barry Sonnenfeld's RV puts yet another dysfunctional family though the paces of yet another summer vacation."

0,Fresh,"Most movies today remind us dates in high school are hard to come by, superheroes can beat up aliens, or serial killers are scary dudes. A movie that wisely contemplates how to deal with profound sadness deserves our respect for that alone."
0,Fresh,"a goosey B-movie with A-list stars, cinematography, and digital effects"
1,Rotten,"""Dracula Untold"" is an artificial glorification lacking reason for the retelling. Even Dracula's wife outshines him in her supporting role."

0,Fresh,"An engaging, once-over-lightly documentary that takes you back to the moment when women, in a public way, were throwing off the last shackles of having to behave themselves."
1,Rotten,Sticks too closely to romantic comedy cliches without being funny and fails to tackle the real obstacle to the main character's complete empowerment.
0,Fresh,The real story is in how the marriage is strengthened or harmed by the way each spouse responds to what's happening.
1,Rotten,one may wish that the entire film had restaged the entirely of Tchaikovsky's ballet rather than reimagine it as an ultimately lifeless epic fantasy.
1,Rotten,The sight -- and sound -- of Johan with his head between the speakers listening to the brutal Scherzo from Bruckner's Ninth Symphony tells you all you need to know.

0,Fresh,"If you're in the mood for a Bollywood film, here's one for you."
1,Rotten,So sad in the year 2017 that women get written into these reductive support roles. Would it have been so hard to make one of Brad's successful college buddies a woman?
0,Fresh,$9.99 uses an extraordinary technique to bring the Israeli writer Etgar Keret's world to life.
1,Rotten,"If a misanthrope goes to a movie, then walks out and is glad to be among people because the filmmaker's world is so much uglier than the misanthrope's own, has the filmmaker accomplished something?"

0,Fresh,"This great cast, Soderbergh's dynamic direction and Leonard's signature style make this one raw, fun and smart caper."
1,Rotten,"Vincente Minnelli has directed this minor epic in pedestrian style, the acting is mostly indifferent, though Burton does manage to rise above his material, and the general atmosphere is one of extreme blandness."

0,Fresh,"The film is intelligent and aware, if utterly gross, and on a technical level it's first-rate."
1,Rotten,"He's got the vibe down. Same with the attitude, dialogue, origins and scenery, but he didn't quite get his hands wrapped around the storytelling element."
0,Fresh,"The movie is hardly breathtaking or a completely successful endeavor, but considering what's been stinking up the box office over the recent weeks, it's quite a respectable diversion nonetheless."

0,Fresh,"A movie essentially without a single surprise, which doesn't make it disagreeable...Murray and young Lieberher develop a nice rapport."
0,Fresh,Our enjoyment of High Crimes depends entirely on how much we identify with these characters -- our immersion in their lives is precisely what carries us over the large and unsightly wrinkles in the script.
0,Fresh,Gal Gadot's perfect blend of battlefield courage and uncomplicated compassion provides a formidable champion we have fun rooting for.
1,Rotten,I've always maintained that even the best actors cannot bring life to dead writing. And dead this writing is --- it couldn't be more plodding in its action and narrative.
1,Rotten,The most frustrating aspect of this film is how it blatantly exploits its female characters.
0,Fresh,"Offering just enough nutty plot twists, silly one-liners and funny supporting performances to leave a smile on your face."

1,Rotten,"...like the wasteoid who trails off mid-sentence to get lost in the cover art for Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion, [Nima] Nourizadeh has trouble concentrating on a single organizing narrative mode for his film."
1,Rotten,"Invictus is stately, handsomely mounted, attentive to detail right down to the Marmite adorning the team's breakfast buffet, and relentlessly conventional."
0,Fresh,"The real star turns out to be the play itself: the early masterpiece of a now-deceased writer, a work of such mirrorlike perfection that it reveals entirely different things to different people."
0,Fresh,The serious side feels simplistic (we're all just humans) and the comedy feels overstated.
1,Rotten,"Apart from a few mildly funny bits of slapstick, ""Drillbit Taylor"" doesn't come near the level of comedy that Judd Apatow and screenwriter Seth Rogen are known for."
0,Fresh,"[It] may be a bummer to some audiences, so harsh is its view of the drug culture. But no one interested in the power and magic of movies should miss it."
1,Rotten,The film would've been better served if the maudlin human struggles and teenybopper romance had been cut and replaced with a bunch of Shiba Inu puppies rolling around the hotel lobby.
0,Fresh,"Sensational, implausible, irresistible to teens."
0,Fresh,"MIB II is faithful to its source film, which in turn sprang from a comic book. But this feels more like submission to formula than devotion to inspiration."

1,Rotten,"To compare Valentine's Day to Richard Curtis' wonderfully funny and moving examination of realized crushes and heartbreak, Love Actually, is like offering you a choice between a date with Lloyd Dobler or a Peterson. Scott or Drew, take your pick."

0,Fresh,"It follows a slower pace, which is fitting for a psychological horror."
1,Rotten,Pompous and garbled.
1,Rotten,It's too bad that something with so much potential was forgotten at the box office. It's especially too bad because the film got what it deserved.
0,Fresh,Some of the choices feel self-indulgent and are a bit distracting but overall a really interesting/thought provoking (and even funny) movie.
0,Fresh,"Although [Oren Peli] has borrowed liberally from films from ""The Blair Witch Project"" to ""The Exorcist"" and a dash of ""Lost Highway,"" ""Paranormal Activity"" is a sterling standout in a genre that usually disappoints."

1,Rotten,"Quickly devolves into Spy vs. Spy territory, only with incompetently staged and edited action and little of that ol' Mad magazine zing."
1,Rotten,Rebecca Miller's attempt to elevate a small Oedipal story about two damaged souls into a grandiloquent epic misses by a significantly wide mark.
1,Rotten,Shows signs of great intentions but never achieves any exceptional moments.
1,Rotten,"What might have scanned as a potent female empowerment message is torpedoed by a lame script and slavish devotion to schtick. Likeable lead performances, though."
0,Fresh,"Balancing wit and romance against a life-or-death drama can be a tricky balance. Their Finest stumbles a little around the middle, but recovers well enough to produce a satisfying film."
1,Rotten,"That anger is explored only superficially and most of the women seem merely to be ornamentation, defined by their problems."
1,Rotten,This well-acted but superficial film winds up being more like a trifle than a full-course cinematic feast.

1,Rotten,"There's a cute ""reinventing having a baby"" comedy here. It just gets lost in all the bathwater."
1,Rotten,"There are more than a few instances of jokes falling with a thud or succumbing to pervasive predictability over the course of its nearly two hours on the screen, leaving Baywatch awash in a sea of mediocrity."
0,Fresh,Nothing to get upset about.
1,Rotten,"Part biopic, part historical gloss, ""Trumbo"" tells a great-man story with a patchwork of fact and fiction, mixing in the odd bit of newsreel with a great many dull, visually flat and poorly lighted dramatic scenes."
0,Fresh,"A skin-crawling thriller without compromise, ""Honeymoon"" is unpleasant, whip-smart and mesmerizing."
1,Rotten,...Big Eyes is most alive when Burton is doodling in the margins.
1,Rotten,"For moviegoers looking to lose themselves in an old-school epic, Queen Of The Desert certainly fits the bill. But as a celebration of the life of a feminist pioneer, the film is sorely lacking."
0,Fresh,"Gloria has a secret weapon called Sofa Espinoza. Not only does she sing all the songs made famous by Trevi, she became Gloria herself. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,Segel and Eisenberg both capture their interplay beautifully in what is essentially a two-hander built around their conversations.
1,Rotten,"Played mostly as a drama but utterly devoid of tension, the film mainly comes across as recycled."
0,Fresh,The Wolverine is good enough that I kept wishing it were better -- that there was another layer to the story or another wrinkle to a character's motivation or a truly spectacular set-piece that lent the proceedings some extra oomph.

0,Fresh,A profound film that grabs you by the throat and holds you hostage until the end credits roll.
1,Rotten,Slattery might not want to quit his day job just yet.

1,Rotten,Both predictable and confounding.
1,Rotten,"Target missed, opportunity lost."
0,Fresh,"We're never far from romance or laughs, and at times 'The Amazing Spider-Man' feels like a romcom upgraded to include 3D and industrial cobwebs."
0,Fresh,"The picture's relative uniqueness is what intrigues and compels, marking Better Luck Tomorrow as important, if not ultimately entirely successful."
0,Fresh,"While it does delve into matters of faith under trying circumstances, it's quite subtle about doing so, and it never pushes an agenda at the expense of the story or characters."
0,Fresh,"Hemsworth is a man most of us know on the screen as the God of Thunder, yet here gives a very different and even dangerously sexy performance."
0,Fresh,"This is a poet's film, harsh, cruel and lovely. There have been few better British films than Brief Encounter even at a time when our studios are taking their place in the vanguard of this great contemporary art."
1,Rotten,"A deadly, desert-set game of cat and mouse that is tired and beyond plausibility."
0,Fresh,Intense and indelibly gripping thriller

1,Rotten,Red Joan is a dishonest film with a dishonest title.
0,Fresh,"If weapons and wizardry get your blood up, and you prefer your movies dark and brooding and - the sandals, Solomon Kane fits the bill. It may lack The Lord Of The Rings' majesty, but Robert E. Howard fans will lap it up."
0,Fresh,"...while it's no Speed, Hard Rain is a suitably diverting way to spend an hour and a half."
0,Fresh,"[Director Currie] never lets the commentary overwhelm the humor, and the echoes of Douglas Sirk melodramas and Lassie movies just add to the fun."

0,Fresh,Heavy-handed melodrama with flashes of brilliance.
0,Fresh,"It is a saga told in small pieces, a patchwork of short scenes that tumble after each other almost apologetically, as if they would love to linger a little longer, but there is too much to tell and only so much time in which to do it."
0,Fresh,"Despite all the fun-to-unpack ideas swirling around Mitchell's premise, this is first and foremost a showcase for his considerable talents as a widescreen visual stylist ..."
0,Fresh,"Berberian Sound Studio is definitely unique with some wonderful moments that nail what Strickland is going for, but it's too uneven to be something truly great."
0,Fresh,"It's refreshingly sparky fare, boasting eye-catching design (wooden toys inspire CG magic), musical weirdness (Radiohead will never sound the same again) and proper laugh-out-loud jokes for young and old alike."
1,Rotten,"Once you get over the initial novelty, you're left with a movie that alternates between lame sitcom-style gags and muddled social commentary."
0,Fresh,Intruders is tautly directed by first-time feature filmmaker Adam Schindler.
0,Fresh,"The first word that comes to mind about ""Under The Sun"" is ""shocking"", although, at times, even that appears modest in describing what I was watching on screen."

1,Rotten,"Rather than investigate the dire life of a teenage girl whose only female role models are atrocious human beings, White Oleander dubiously follows the formula of the female weepie."
1,Rotten,Triple 9 is a complex story with simplistic characters. The two don't go together.
0,Fresh,"A smart, engaged film powered by an altogether remarkable performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, it is melodrama grounded in a disturbing reality, an extreme scenario that is troubling because it cuts close to the bone."
0,Fresh,...a thoroughly involving thriller that boasts a number of genuinely tense sequences...
1,Rotten,It isn't much of a movie -- the plotline has been whittled down to next to nothing -- but it's a terrific showcase for its formidable star.
0,Fresh,IT: Chapter Two falls into the classic sequel trap of overemphasizing what worked in the past instead of fully committing to the future.
0,Fresh,"The dance routines are like 'American Bandstand' on steroids, but 'Hairspray' is first-class entertainment for just about everybody in the family."

1,Rotten,It's like discovering your box of Milk Duds is really chocolate-covered vitamins.
0,Fresh,"Interesting throughout, and marked by a certain grungy-chic quality, but also seems like a bit of a missed opportunity, insofar as its lack of expansion to story's international component."
1,Rotten,"For all of the roiling emotion, it feels oddly flat, distant and one-dimensional."
0,Fresh,We Need To Talk About Kevin doesn't just bring you to the outskirts of a parent's worst nightmare; this fever dream of guilt and loss takes you straight inside.
1,Rotten,"Sayles cheats the viewer with an ending that might have looked enigmatic on another film, but looks like a cop-out on this one."
0,Fresh,"Birds of Prey proves that it's no longer a man's world, it's Harley Quinn's - and we should be so lucky."

1,Rotten,"It's hard to say who's more at fault: writer, director, actors, pool boy."
1,Rotten,Part of the reason the superhero genre has managed to elevate itself is it gives us characters that we root for and care about. Venom does none of this.

0,Fresh,Fans of adult themes in animation will likely marvel.
1,Rotten,"Maybe X-Men: The Last Stand wasn't an accurate adaptation of the Dark Phoenix comics, but at least it was a fun celebration of an ensemble of character. Dark Phoenix feels joyless and obligatory."

1,Rotten,"Mel Brooks's movie History of the World, Part 1 is a rambling, undisciplined, sometimes embarrassing failure from one of the most gifted comic filmmakers around."
1,Rotten,"Just a cut above the typical, but it goes without saying: your mileage may vary. [Blu-ray]"
1,Rotten,"Amazing. Incredible. Unbelievable. Astonishing. Painful. All these words come to mind in just the first 10 minutes of viewing this film, none of them in a good way."
0,Fresh,"It neither demonizes nor lionizes either side of the conflict, aiming for just-the-ugly facts objectivity. Nobody who sees it is likely to feel comforted, or even vindicated. The emotion it most frequently and fervently inspires is sorrow."
1,Rotten,And as the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock once said: 'The length of a film should be directly related to endurance of the human bladder' - and It: Chapter Two just goes too far.
0,Fresh,"The whole thing reads as an indictment of the sort of upper class upbringing that Milne's children's books idealised, with only paid employees offering worthwhile parental affection."

0,Fresh,Enthralling movie about the violent upheavals of war and the healing power of love.

0,Fresh,A singularity among the clones it so deftly and ingeniously parodies.
0,Fresh,A brilliantly visualized concept anchors Inside Out in a way that ensures it will resonate for years to come. Kudos to Pixar for again reminding us that animated entertainment can appeal to all ages and speak to universal truths.

0,Fresh,Disaster epic catches the Perfect wave.
1,Rotten,"It's dutiful, but it's also superficial and polite, and it commits the genteel sin of the old biopics: It turns its hero into a plaster saint."
0,Fresh,This fizzy romantic comedy is slight but charming and perks up considerably when Allen himself makes an appearance.
0,Fresh,"Go for the music, go for Taron Egerton, stay for the supporting cast and the knowledge you gain..."
1,Rotten,"The casting of Robert De Niro as an ex-Mafioso hiding in witness protection is witty in only the silliest, most superficial way. It's a joke with its own tinny, built-in laugh track."
0,Fresh,"I expect to roll my eyes several times while the kids consume their dose of morality. In contrast, El Dorado skips the preaching and focuses more on the comedy."
1,Rotten,"Played with such an utter lack of charisma by Leo Gregory, Jones comes across as a rocker so drug- and ego-addled he doesn't have enough sense to lie down."
1,Rotten,Madame aspires to more than it delivers but the film's failure to highlight its only worthwhile character makes it feel cluttered with irrelevant and at times annoying material.
1,Rotten,"It's not the least bit scary or suspenseful but instead quickly grows tedious. The more you struggle to keep track of the constantly multiplying plot developments, the harder it gets to care who did it."
0,Fresh,"When Your Highness moves away from the dirty jokes and focuses more on the adventure at hand, it's actually pretty entertaining."
1,Rotten,Maybe I've got some subconscious porcine fetish thing going (or something) but I think Christina Ricci looks kind of cute with a pig's snout where her nose should be...
0,Fresh,"Even though the next phase is still shrouded in mystery, Spider-Man: Far From Home does a fantastic job of latching the door that Endgame closed, while opening a whole new universe of possibilities for Marvel."
0,Fresh,"Despite the movie's bruised heart the film is often sweet and funny, and the obvious affection for the orphans and their caretakers shines through."
0,Fresh,This is the Transformers film we wanted all along
1,Rotten,"Charlie Says, for all its contemplative trappings, is no less exploitative than many other Manson films."
0,Fresh,"I am rating this movie at three stars because it contains absolutely nothing to object to. That in itself may be objectionable, but you will have to decide for yourself."
0,Fresh,"It doesn't say anything too deep, but it says it with crystalline style."
0,Fresh,It sidesteps the usual cliches. Fame and fortune matter less than the human connections that are fostered and repaired on this unlikely journey.
0,Fresh,"One enjoys it the way one enjoys a forgettable genre entry that gets most things right, then largely dissolves from the memory. Indeed, not even Eva Green as a mute, scarred gunslinger is very memorable."
1,Rotten,"While it brings a great deal of energy and promise to the table, the film ultimately succumbs to its own bombastic tendencies."
0,Fresh,"Policemen, journalists who dislike rap and Suge Knight will find little to enjoy in this movie - all are portrayed as villains with zero subtlety. But the film as a whole is critical of its heroes' mistakes."
0,Fresh,"The movie has the intense psychological focus of the late Claude Chabrol, if not Chabrol's graceful camerawork."
0,Fresh,intriguingly well-told story
0,Fresh,"It's familiar enough not to spook fans of the (highly profitable) first, but Happy Feet Two branches out beyond prefab coming-of-age stories and gimmicky pop-song set pieces."
0,Fresh,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves certainly boasts many of the qualities that one has come to expect from such an endeavor...
0,Fresh,"An interesting, if high minded, concept film that is nothing without its performers."
1,Rotten,"Just once I'd like to see a Star Wars film and be wowed by seeing something completely new and fresh. I didn't hate it, however it commits the crime of being underwhelming and unoriginal."
0,Fresh,"Black's performance is the key to making The D-Train more than just another sophomoric bromance. The wild-eyed mania is still evident, but channeled through a filter of pity."
0,Fresh,"This is a movie that is all journey, no destination...But there's no escaping the fact that it knows what it is. And that's an accessible, PG-13-rated thriller."
0,Fresh,The one Welles film that deserves to be called lovely.
0,Fresh,An entertaining and enlightening documentary that nimbly juggles a multitude of topics
1,Rotten,"Insurgent seems to indicate that the studios are content to simply go through the genre motions with this one. Whatever promise was offered by the first film is largely gone, leaving the franchise to plod to the finish line."
0,Fresh,"Na takes his sweet time, more than 2  1/2 hours, to build to his shattering climax -- and yet not a minute of it feels wasted or superfluous. By the end of The Wailing, the audience knows it has been taken on a dark and twisted ride."
1,Rotten,"God must love summer movies, since He designed my nervous system so the frontal lobes could be left idle while the core delights in bursts of pulsing orange fireballs set against an otherwise gun-metal palette. But we must evolve!"
1,Rotten,This looks and sounds like every other biopic.
1,Rotten,"Listen, I have a family."
0,Fresh,"Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea is an engaging, entertaining snapshot of a long, tragicomic moment in American history."
0,Fresh,Audiences will be enchanted by Clemons and Offerman's astounding chemistry.

0,Fresh,This is a very funny satire of television.
0,Fresh,"Refreshingly unconventional narrative developments, complex characters and great performances"
1,Rotten,Super Capers doesn't ever come close to justifying its existence.
1,Rotten,Some filmmakers put feelings into words; Malick uses smoke signals and semaphore to express things felt but unspoken. How you interpret them is up to you.
0,Fresh,It displays an intimate chemical understanding of the exhausting and unrelentingly impotent agony of failure.
0,Fresh,"This is a movie you are likely to hate, unless you can love it for its crazy, feverish charm."
1,Rotten,The creative spark and sense of purpose are gone in this hokey transcontinental caper.
1,Rotten,The last time I felt this let down was when Bill Buckner let a certain ground ball roll between his legs during the 1986 World Series.
0,Fresh,"Standing above fashion, it creates a world so convincing that it becomes, for a time, another life we might have lived."
0,Fresh,It seems the poisoned apple doesn't fall far from the rotting tree.
0,Fresh,The film also provides an inspiring reminder for the young and the rest of us that there is a vital relationship between the best kind of work and passionate play.
0,Fresh,"While it's a real blast to watch Lanthimos cleave the head from the romcom genre and roast it on a spit, the more The Lobster dwells on the harsh truths behind the struggle for companionship, the harder it becomes to watch."
0,Fresh,The philosophical depth unearthed in Kedi is astounding.
0,Fresh,"remains squarely in the realm of family entertainment, but it's lush and effective as such (if a little more violent than usual)"
1,Rotten,The party's over a lot earlier than the distracted hosts appear to realize.
1,Rotten,"While Eternal starts off strong, with an intense supernatural and hyper-sexual undercurrent that's sort of interesting, by the start of the third act, Eternal slips into something near camp."
0,Fresh,"Overall, A Quiet Passion is interesting if not always enjoyable, although it gets better as it moves along and will probably resonate most with the 19th-century poet's fans."
0,Fresh,Clint Eastwood's brilliant and harrowing Unforgiven packs all the punch of a good Western without indulging in the plot cliches and moral certitudes so often inherent in the genre.
1,Rotten,I wish I liked Shirley better. The brazen weirdness of the film makes me want to root for it. The core thematic element that condemns masculine domination of artistic spaces is great. The music is-it cannot be stressed enough-divine. But it never gels.
0,Fresh,"The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in."
0,Fresh,"Yes, we've seen all this stuff before, but we've never seen this version of this stuff before."
1,Rotten,"The gender commentary is still on point, and The Final Girls successfully disembowels its target trope. But it works better as film criticism than it does as a film."
0,Fresh,"It's a romantic comedy every bit as delicious as something Howard Hawks might have concocted, with Loren and Mastroianni proving fine rivals for the likes of Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant."
0,Fresh,"For all its foibles and occasional missteps, Bridget Jones's Baby marks a very welcome return for a character who, all these years on, hasn't lost her neurotic charm in the slightest."
0,Fresh,"The First French Army, composed mostly of 130,000 North Africans, were referred to contemptuously by the French as indigènes -- natives. Their bravery in wartime has never, until now, been adequately described in a movie."
1,Rotten,"Maybe another rewrite, maybe an extra writer, maybe a better concept..."
1,Rotten,"[The film] contains a couple of funny bits, like Jackson teaching fast reflexes through doorbell-ringing pranks, but you have to slog through a lot of done-to-death bodily function jokes to get to them."
0,Fresh,"A wholly adequate spin on the dying romantic-comedy genre, and both Faris and Derbez come out looking like champs."
0,Fresh,"There's nothing subtle, surprising, or sophisticated about this story, which is as chewed over as a dog's favorite bedroom slipper."
0,Fresh,"Along with Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, as authentic a depiction of a Wild West town as you are likely to find."
1,Rotten,"The romantic plot, involving his unrequited loved for Garner, is soured by her character's unconcealed shallowness."
0,Fresh,A raunchy between-the-sheets peak at modern-day black sexuality...should woo urban audiences to the theater.
0,Fresh,"This is the perfect way to update an already existing film - by never drawing from the nostalgia of the original, creating it's own unique song."
1,Rotten,"Cracks only strays from the boarding school genre's playbook when it's entering questionable territory, making for a picture that's easily forgettable except in its disappointments."
0,Fresh,"Like a really satisfying game, the score at the end of each is no indication of who will win at the final buzzer."
1,Rotten,A decaffinated and sitcomish approach to a boulevard comedy of early middle-age behavior
1,Rotten,"A good performance from Breslin keeps tension alive, but hope for a really scary and inventive fright dies screaming in the basement."
0,Fresh,"In The Polka King, Forbes amp up the lunacy, star power, and energy to create something not only sensationally fun, but also enticingly thought-provoking."

0,Fresh,Rich with forbidding details and impressive scare tactics.
0,Fresh,"Charming low-tech absurdism, free of irony and full of escalating stakes, situations, hilarity, and charm."
0,Fresh,The stakes throughout the entire movie were incredibly high.
0,Fresh,"An agile and funny story, with a simple but effective atmosphere. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Overcomes the heavy-handed means of reaching its goal ... simply because Freeman believes every word and owns every sentiment that the Mandela of the film expounds, and we believe it right along with him."
0,Fresh,"Once again, there's nothing here that's particularly original or memorable, but the characters are endearing and the manic animation is relentlessly hilarious."
0,Fresh,"The movie insists on the value of the everyday. Gloria's heroism is her dignity, her intelligence, her perseverance."

0,Fresh,Ali is played brilliantly by Will Smith.
1,Rotten,I don't care and can't even begin to pretend to care.
0,Fresh,"There's plenty of room to poke holes in the premise, but folks willing to suspend disbelief can still have a good time."
0,Fresh,"The film has already won several awards at film festivals, and once you see it, you'll understand why people are clamoring to see Colin Firth win an Academy Award."
0,Fresh,I'm sorry Mr. Spielberg; you've just relinquished your title. Peter Jackson is now the reigning god of awesome movies.
0,Fresh,...a face-off as farce.
1,Rotten,Trying to get audiences to root for whether fish will swim upstream is often an easier task than getting them to care about whether the two leads will hook up.
0,Fresh,Put away the knives aimed at Cruise and just enjoy the solid work he keeps putting out.
1,Rotten,"Acaba revelando, em seu ato final, um esforço intrigante para surpreender o espectador, a esta altura, já fomos obrigados a agüentar uma infinidade de diálogos desastrosos e seqüências frouxas de ação e pouco pode ser feito para salvar o filme."
0,Fresh,"The movie may be a scare show that leaves many questions unanswered, but Scott's craft earns an exhausted kind of respect."
1,Rotten,"Instead of resting on his comedic laurels, David Zucker deserves to be flogged by them."
0,Fresh,"The Childhood Of A Leader is as relentlessly sombre and compelling as the film's remarkable, full-volume orchestral soundtrack by musician's musician Scott Walker."
0,Fresh,"The film is worth seeing for the performances, but the drama is a nonstarter."
0,Fresh,Dig deep and you'll find a film that's even richer than what its handsome surface seems to reveal.
0,Fresh,"Although it still only just gets away with sundry homophobic and size-ist gags, there's a tad more zing than the original, though if you caught that already, be warned: this is a scene-for-scene retread."
1,Rotten,"This quiet, closed-in picture with its unsurprising twists and turns, lacks the steamy passion of its pulp roots."
0,Fresh,"A strangely mesmerizing, innovative film whose artistic stature has increased largely due to its absorbing look at British crime and art worlds circa 1968, and riveting turns by Mick Jagger and James Foxx who exchange personalities in this tale."
1,Rotten,"Directed by Fred Durst (of the band ""Limp Bizkit""), ""The Longshots"" is a cookie-cutter feel-good kid's movie that seems like it was made by some faulty gadget stuck on auto-pilot."
0,Fresh,"A Star is Born foregrounds all of the ways Jackson and Ally are enamored with each other, the intimacy that enhanced their bond and the affection that inspired their songs."
1,Rotten,"A two-hour film needs characters we believe, like, and feel connected to, not freaks from a sideshow."
0,Fresh,"It's impossible to take your eyes off Bening when she's on the screen, not just because she's lovely but because she makes being Julia seem so darned fun."
1,Rotten,"The cast do decent work, but Clooney's ersatz Fargo misses the mark. A Coen pastiche rather than the real deal."
1,Rotten,"A would-be romantic drama as lumbering as an elephant. Pattinson and Witherspoon have lost their usual sparkle; a tedious film, with leaden direction and a charmless script."
0,Fresh,"The comedy teams longtime ""Saturday Night Live"" vets Tina Fey and Amy Poehler - two of the funniest individuals on the planet, in my opinion - for a comedy that distinctly exploits their synergistic comic sensibilities."
0,Fresh,"If nothing else, the pic's zany tone and manic pace are good for a quick-hit sugar high."

1,Rotten,The Matrix Revolutions is where I sadly fell out of love with the whole exotic franchise
0,Fresh,The highly theatrical finale is one of the most gracious film moments you'll ever witness.
1,Rotten,"Soon deteriorates into a pointless travelogue of explosions as the pair are chased from a tropical island to Austria and on to Spain, the plot becoming more tedious with every location."
1,Rotten,"If nothing else, Man of the House permits older viewers to ogle younger actresses under the excuse that they're going to that new Tommy Lee Jones film."

0,Fresh,"Spurlock says he's not selling out, he's buying in. I'm buying into Spurlock. As ever, he makes you laugh till it hurts."
1,Rotten,"Dense with plot and mythology, the film is refreshingly unpredictable - if only because guessing what comes next would require understanding what the hell is going on."
0,Fresh,The film finally gets into gear around the midpoint and zooms to a satisfying finish.
1,Rotten,"It's Pine that keeps the whole thing afloat, and he manages, astonishingly, to make even the clunkiest, cheesiest lines work, almost transforming the film's chocolate-box sentiments into something honest."
1,Rotten,"[It] has the unfortunate vantage of men trying to rationalize the actions of a woman neither they, nor their film, fully understand."
1,Rotten,[VIDEO ESSAY] Josh Whedon's sophomoric attempt at swimming in Kenneth Brannagh's waters of expertise - namely adapting Shakespeare plays to film - is akin to watching a wet cat lick itself dry.
0,Fresh,"It isn't quite a good movie, but I do admire the effort, and the spirit, that went into it."

0,Fresh,"Through it all, Hosoda tells a rich and warm-hearted story about a middle-class family that is imperfect but loving."
1,Rotten,"Cruise and Diaz have worked together before, but this is their first summer-movie pairing, and their star qualities are so similar that together, instead of romantic chemistry they generate a sort of giddy, blinding falseness."
1,Rotten,"These contrived scenarios and close calls come consecutively and in great number, and it's hard not to roll your eyes a bit at the impossibility of it all, especially in a setting this gritty and grounded."
1,Rotten,"Like most movies seeking instant cult-film status, something is missing -- authentic exploitation madness maybe."
0,Fresh,"a near-perfect popcorn movie. See it, love it, then move right along, folks."

0,Fresh,"""Silence"" can be a riveting and forceful film. Still, it feels more about abstractions than emotions."
1,Rotten,Hess' eccentric characters are neither likable enough to root for nor ridiculous enough to earn big laughs.
0,Fresh,"First-time filmmaker Richard Tanne conjures an effective sense of time and place -- Chicago, 1989 -- and the leads are a real find, radiating authority, charm and chemistry."
0,Fresh,[It] has to be seen to be believed.
1,Rotten,The big twist is so ridiculous that viewers will more likely find themselves laughing at its sheer silliness than reeling from its dramatic rug-pulling.
0,Fresh,"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping just might be the dumbest movie of the summer -- which, in spite of how it sounds, is an absolute compliment."

0,Fresh,Its warmth and good humour make it the perfect antidote to the late-winter blues.
0,Fresh,"Despite its imperfections, this is a smart entry in the horror genre, a film that isn't just about spooking its audience, but actually has something meaningful and urgent to say about the modern world as it stands in 2015."
0,Fresh,"Director Gabriele Muccino and producer-actor Smith have made a humble and affecting tribute to the struggles of the urban poor in America, while demonstrating, at least, one man's relentless pursuit of joy."
1,Rotten,"The art-world satire Boogie Woogie is a monumental piece of squandered potential, arch but not witty, mean without being perceptive, its most outrageous shocks little more than static sparks."
0,Fresh,...a bona fide classic of the horror genre...

0,Fresh,Teller totally immerses himself in the physically taxing role and the movie distinguishes itself thanks to its painstaking depiction of the real-life Paz's grueling comeback.

0,Fresh,The film begins as a fascinating inside look at the TV news business and then tightens into a spellbinding thriller.
0,Fresh,"If you're a fan of the musical, or a member of the cast, then by all means go see ""CATS."" If you're not a fan of musical theatre, go stand in line and see ""Star Wars"" again."
1,Rotten,"Hate to make the obvious snark, but sometimes ""More"" is less."
0,Fresh,"Haggis still has a weakness for big dramatic gestures and heavy-handed symbolism, but a somber tone and Jones' tight-lipped yet moving performance nicely undercut the tendency toward Crash-style overwrought melodrama."

1,Rotten,"Disaster filmmeister Roland Emmerich meets Shakespeare: behold, Bard-Zilla is nigh!"
1,Rotten,"Aaliyah fans, as well as fans of charisma, sex, and violence, will be sorely disappointed."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, it's popcorn nihilism without the big laughs that helped distract from the casual approach to life and death in 'Red'."
0,Fresh,"Mungiu's Beyond the Hills delicately explores a highly controversial, contemporary subject with the care and intelligence that it necessitates."
0,Fresh,"Yes, it's silly. Yes, the acting is bad. However, in an era of some of the best, most dread inducing horror we have ever had, sometimes it's next to throw ourselves back to a 90's horror camp era and just enjoy the kills."
0,Fresh,"While there are action sequences, the quiet moments work best . One gets a ""Shawshank"" vibe as the men longingly look into one another's eyes expressing platonic love as only two original X-Men can. Yes, fanboy, this movie is for you, and count me in."
1,Rotten,"Oh yeah, the Bee Gees are much better than that other band."
0,Fresh,"While Avengement isn't exactly a classic in any regard, it's a step in the right direction for a new breed of British thumpfests that - if Adkins can wield his sensibilities correctly - may just begin to rival their Eastern origins."
0,Fresh,"I was not expecting to enjoy this film, but I have to admit, Why Him? is likeable and funny. While the film isn't destined to be a critical darling, it succeeded in making me laugh"
0,Fresh,"Walking out to your own city's streets afterward, you'll likely have a ""Hey, this isn't Gotham!"" moment. It's a level of transportation that no cackling, Kool Aid-colored villain could achieve, but it's what every comic book fan truly wants."
0,Fresh,"On the whole, while it isn't exactly an example of great filmmaking, The Hitman's Bodyguard does take you on a fun, two-hour long ride. Just don't expect it to bring anything new to the genre or surprise you in any way."

0,Fresh,Is this great art? Of course not. But it's a kick.
1,Rotten,One of the great disappointments of my cinematic year so far.
0,Fresh,"Mr. Roskam's direction is gratifyingly loose. He lets the story, which is really the least interesting part of the movie, more or less take care of itself, allowing us to savor pungent morsels of dialogue and bits of low-key actorly showboating."
1,Rotten,"As irksome as it is, the concept is actually better for Stallone than the premises of his earlier awful romps."
0,Fresh,"It's an eye-opener, if a blatantly chauvinistic one: Rock's main beefs seem to be that men have to pay for it, and upkeep of such a coveted accessory is a barrier to intimacy in the bedroom."
0,Fresh,"...a transfixing experience that inspires a kind of solemn awe on an initial viewing, but upon reflection it yields its fair share of humor."

0,Fresh,"While its tone wildly varies, when it comes to the glut of horror remakes, it's a slight step ahead of the standard batch."
0,Fresh,"Without changing things much, he contemporizes the material, allowing the animals of the jungle to become even more human by appropriating personalities that are familiar and commonplace within the current state of pop culture."

1,Rotten,Startlingly inept coming from a generally accomplished director like Norman Jewison.

1,Rotten,Efficient but fairly unexciting.
1,Rotten,"Almost imperceptibly, the 'is she alive or dead' equation takes over the entire affair."

0,Fresh,"If all you get out of it is laughing at their many pratfalls, that will be enough to make this a game worth playing."
0,Fresh,"The last moments of Room end with a whisper - one barely audible above the sobs and sniffles of the audience. Like so much of Room, it is perfect."
0,Fresh,"With minimal gore, Peele prefers to get inside his viewers' heads. Scaring you is the first thing he wants to do, but he'll ask you to think while he's there, too."
0,Fresh,"a great, goofy, visceral piece of genre filmmaking"
0,Fresh,"Ticks all the right boxes in terms of character, spectacle and alien ass-kicking action."

1,Rotten,"We get bullets flying, stuff blowing up real good and the kind of slice-and-dice editing that renders all that action all but impossible to follow. What we don't get, alas, is much character development or emotional depth."
1,Rotten,Tobe Hooper's latest is not unlike an episode of Melrose Place as imagined by Lucio Fulci.
0,Fresh,"I'll say up front that I pretty much figured out the plot twist about 10 minutes into the film, but that didn't stop me from enjoying ""Suburbicon."""
0,Fresh,'Argo' only clocks in at a two-hour running time and tells a much better story than the films that over-stuff audiences with nearly three-hours.
0,Fresh,"It feels like an interesting exercise, a chance for Russell and his cast to dress up and have fun now that none of them really have nothing left to prove."
0,Fresh,"Daniel Craig's stated goal was to make Spectre ""better than Skyfall."" Not quite, but it's still party time for Bond fans."
0,Fresh,Littlerock wins your involvement by its meandering off-handedness and refusal to play up its strangers-in-a-strange-land conceit.
0,Fresh,"Funny, sometimes funky feminist fable by ur-feminist director Susan Seidelman is easy to like, if hard to believe."
0,Fresh,"Honestly, nobody does it better.."
1,Rotten,"The BBC production ran nearly five hours; this new movie runs a bit more than two, which just isn't enough time."
1,Rotten,"Murky and drab...straining for a nourish sense of foreboding, the film only manages to be dankly tedious."
0,Fresh,One of those rare motion pictures with side-splitting laughs where the humor never stays dormant for long.
1,Rotten,"Loeb, the man behind more than one Kevin James vehicle, attempts Christmastime magic  la Miracle on 34th Street, but ends up conjuring Maudlin on Madison Avenue instead."
1,Rotten,"Glum and self-serving, with only Bening's spot-on performance to recommend it."
1,Rotten,"Lacking the sophistication of the average comic book, it compensates with panoramic attack sequences, reminiscent of the Japanese swarm attacks in American war movies."
1,Rotten,A deadly heaviness brings Disney's would-be epic down.
0,Fresh,"Not in the same league as The Sixth Sense, but Shyamalan ends a long dry spell with The Visit. No spoilers, except to say that cheap thrills can still be a blast."
1,Rotten,"The animators are clearly trying to craft something bubbly, but they misguidedly go all in on imitating the contemporary Disney model - or DreamWorks', at least - rather than offering anything different."

0,Fresh,"Rude and lewd, full of potty humor and penis jokes, The 40 Year Old Virgin is the best comedy in years."
0,Fresh,"The haughtily unenlightened can joke and snipe and snore all the want. As evinced by Song to Song, Malick is operating in top form. If only we'd be bothered to do the work of making sense of it."
0,Fresh,"It is entertaining, and often touching, even if it pulls back right when it should be going totally nuts."
1,Rotten,"[It] leaves us wanting more - more on Bulger's childhood, more on the Irish gangs, more on the awful crimes themselves."
1,Rotten,Almost as embarrassing as Black Snake Moan -- all the more so because nobody involved in the film seems to recognize how icky it all is.
0,Fresh,"A great screwball comedy, with Stanwyck in one of her sexiest roles."
1,Rotten,A film we've seen a thousand times around Oscar season...
0,Fresh,A blend of familiar (but still funny) mockery of the art scene with a really creepy supernatural horror story.
1,Rotten,"The message is that chess can motivate working-class kids to become better students, and though that's nice to know, the movie doesn't illustrate this theme in much depth."
0,Fresh,"Chiwetel Ejiofor is ... utterly convincing as Lola and plays her as a force of nature; funny, loud, sexy and, in the film's most dramatic scenes, genuinely moving"
0,Fresh,The filmmakers use a wide range of cinematic techniques to convey the tenuous environment in which their subjects find themselves.
0,Fresh,"The action is brilliant, the combat sharp and rattling, and the film follows the historical record more closely than most Hollywood films."
0,Fresh,The actors come alive with enough mini-dramas for a couple of daytime soap operas.
0,Fresh,"Not only is this a vivid exploration of Radner's life, but it's also a remarkable look at how the need to perform expresses itself, sometimes leading to pure magic."
1,Rotten,Queen Margot is like elaborate illustrations for a book we haven't read.
1,Rotten,"The soul of the grape, that thing that elevates a wine to greatness, proves here as elusive on screen as in the bottle."
1,Rotten,"The genitals are exposed while the motivations are mysterious in 'Shame,' an elegantly composed but overwrought film about a man who wants to f(ornicate) away the pain."
1,Rotten,A stodgy snoozefest that - at least to begin with - plays out like an unintentional spoof.
0,Fresh,This is a good holiday film for the family.
0,Fresh,"Clever, competent filmmaking with lovable characters and catchy dialog, the kind of movie Aaron Sorkin might make if he was just a smidge less of a smarmy prick. And obviously, Affleck's beard is the bomb."
0,Fresh,The results are entertaining -- up to a point.
0,Fresh,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire takes the narrative and thematic liberties traditionally granted the middle chapter in a trilogy and drives the stakes up sharply.
0,Fresh,Visually stunning but virtually indecipherable ...
0,Fresh,"Flannery O'Connor's incisive sense of person and place is brilliantly captured in this 1979 film adaptation of her highly regarded first novel, which plays out as a broad comedy set within a timeless purgatory."
1,Rotten,This is the kind of flop that makes even the popcorn taste lousy.
0,Fresh,"Bleed is really nothing you haven't seen before, but there's still some pretty interesting elements that result from its mixtape approach."
0,Fresh,"The movie soars with its honest portrayal of Sir Elton, anchored by a show-stopping, where-did-that-come-from lead performance from Egerto."
0,Fresh,"Without Timon and Pumbaa, I would rate this movie a lot lower. In fact, if it wasn't for them, I probably would have fallen asleep in the theater."
0,Fresh,"Despite a few stylistic flourishes, the production is an earnest and straightforward account of what happened, with moments of naturalistic humor based on some major miscommunication."
1,Rotten,The not-so-wicked melodramas that ensue bring to mind a tame revue of V.C. Andrews' garden-themed Flowers in the Attic series.
0,Fresh,"I don't expect to see a lot of movies like this, nor do I want to. It wouldn't be as special otherwise."
0,Fresh,"The literal ghouls here take a back seat to the subtler ones, which are really where ""It"" shines darkly."

0,Fresh,It's cute enough to earn your money and your time.
0,Fresh,"Accomplished performances hampered by a narrow frame, with little sense of scale or importance."
1,Rotten,"Not every director is well-suited to Bondland. ""There's something horribly efficient about you,"" Kurylenko says to Craig at one point. The same goes for the film."
0,Fresh,Anyone who's logged time in an office will be laughing hysterically at all of the little indignities.
0,Fresh,"It's a massive, epic piece of science fiction that keeps the audience engaged, entertained and stunned."
0,Fresh,"Clones largely brings everything together, deepening the arc of the entire story ... and restoring the mythological grandeur that helped establish the series in the first place."
1,Rotten,"Here, for all fans of the world's most pathetic movies, is an apocalyptically disastrous horror flick set in the Bible belt."
1,Rotten,"The performances help establish the surreal and interesting world of the film, but overall, Between Worlds feels like wasted potential."
0,Fresh,"If there is one thing that Mann makes sure to get right in his movies, it's the look, and Public Enemies is no exception."
0,Fresh,Reasonably amusing doc about a salesman whose strong (read: weak) language gains fame.
0,Fresh,"Cate Blanchett like you've never seen before, gritty and stripped down. Both in look and performance."
1,Rotten,The documentary would have been that much better with a more explicit focus on why the average filmgoer should care.
1,Rotten,Evening's take on defining life choices reveals its manic depressive nature.
0,Fresh,"Were it not for its arguably messed-up finale, 'Savages' would be one of director Oliver Stone's most enjoyable crime dramas."
1,Rotten,The high-concept plot is so formulaic and predictable it feels more like software than script.
0,Fresh,"The key, as Fiona points out, is to know when you have everything, and be grateful. It's a worthy conclusion to the tale. We can all live happily ever after."
1,Rotten,Spectacularly unpleasant.
0,Fresh,"Exposes a reality made increasingly opaque by mania, technology, sexual tumult"
1,Rotten,"Less like a remake than just another tired sequel, the new film puts Jason through the same old moves with all the finese of a blind choreographer directing an arthritic dancer."
0,Fresh,"The talented Mr. Minghella has fashioned a seductive, sad portrait of a man helplessly watching the loss of his own soul."
1,Rotten,"A bloody mess as a movie, one with acting so lame it's likely to prompt shrieks, not of horror but of derisive laughter."

1,Rotten,"Seven Pounds has one fantastic scene that I wish we could all see and discuss. Sadly, to get to that scene you have to sit through quite a bit of melodrama (with a side of cheese)."
0,Fresh,"It's a sign of how quickly like the world is being torn apart around us that even a ripped-from-the-headlines documentary such as ""The Great Hack"" can feel almost dated."
1,Rotten,All the adorability in the world can't save Hudson from another plug-ugly comedy.
1,Rotten,"Despite its many action scenes and should-have-been tense moments, the film packs very little excitement."
1,Rotten,"Sorry, Captain, our dilithium crystals are run down completely. The Star Trek franchise is dead in the water!"
1,Rotten,"Fonda's clever casting and good-humored performance can't save this clunky, obvious mess - ludicrous from its contrived premise on. A waste of Beresford and the actors."
0,Fresh,"While the film suffers a slightly diminished impact, it lives up to expectations."
1,Rotten,"Sincerity and restraint can be good things in independent movies, but not when you run the risk of putting the audience to sleep..."
0,Fresh,"Overall the movie forces some very intriguing questions and lively discussions. The first two acts are satisfying and engaging. The third act, not so much."
1,Rotten,An underwhelming psychological thriller and ghost story.
0,Fresh,The Invitation closes with an absolutely jaw-dropping final few minutes that more than compensates for its minor deficiencies...
0,Fresh,This is a film that will tap into some very basic fears.
0,Fresh,"This is one of the best films of the year, and certainly one of the most cautious and compassionate I've seen about the issues it raises."
0,Fresh,"One of the pleasures of Blitz's film is that it immerses us in the fraught, competitive pressures of the high-school debate world-like Spellbound, it gets the details right."
0,Fresh,Writer-director Hany Abu-Assad is more interested in the ideas within his slow-burn thriller than in plot machinations.
0,Fresh,An origin story that stays true to its predecessors while crafting its own unique identity.
1,Rotten,It's an absolutely unnecessary sequel that fails to keep the buzz of the original going.
0,Fresh,This lurid trifle is actually fun on a trashy level!
1,Rotten,"Michael Radford's leisurely paced Flawless digs itself into a deep, cavernous hole in its opening scene and never manages to crawl out of it."
1,Rotten,"Onur Tukel goes to great lengths to ensure you hate his main character Erik Sparrow, and with only that mission in mind, Summer Of Blood is an unfortunate success."
1,Rotten,"Disturbing is the film's apparent conviction that the surefire way to a woman's heart involves lots of candles and a mani-pedi, the sort of notion that isn't so much cute and old-fashioned as it is acutely offensive."
0,Fresh,"A very middle-of-the-road British comedy-drama, making tracks for the same mature-age crowd that loves their Best Exotic Marigold Hotel movies, and wish there were more of them. No shame in that, really..."
0,Fresh,"A Most Violent Year is very good, but it could have been devastating."
1,Rotten,An acquired taste with its quirky camaraderie and forced humor.
0,Fresh,"The third act, though, is a blood-soaked, laugh-out-loud thrill-ride which makes amends for the film's somewhat laborious opening."
0,Fresh,"This is an origin story with plenty of origin, but also a sly kind of humor that sometimes gets pushed aside in all these comic book films."
0,Fresh,Smart yet simple enough to work on several levels.
0,Fresh,"This fourth ogre outing delivers plenty of 3D razzle dazzle and has fun messing about with its alternate-reality storyline, but it never troubles the modernclassic status achieved by the first Shrek. Still, a chunky step up from Shrek The Third."
0,Fresh,"The larger-than-life characters, the jarring colour schemes and, especially, the Chemical Brothers' erratic, block-rocking score reflect the world as its protagonist experiences it: beautiful, violent, loud and frequently bizarre."
0,Fresh,The film works surprisingly well.
0,Fresh,A decidedly underwhelming (yet somewhat watchable) thriller...
0,Fresh,Top notch spy thriller
0,Fresh,Murphy ensures that the film is laced with a very singular brand of Kiwi humour.
1,Rotten,I guess we can give Flatliners at least one star for knowing the cliches of scriptwriting.
0,Fresh,"There's really not much going on with Roar storywise. But then you take a step back and think about what it is that you're watching. My viewing of Roar was set to a soundtrack of ""Oh my God!"" and ""Holy crap!"", all of my own making."
0,Fresh,"Take a closer look, as Lofty Nathan does in his freewheeling debut feature... and bike gangs like the 12 O'Clock Boys start to differentiate as more than just a dangerous nuisance."
1,Rotten,"Honestly, the only reason the film didn't grate on my nerves more than it did had everything to do with Robertson."
1,Rotten,"Viewers are graced with a few disappointingly subdued action scenes, two humdrum romantic subplots, and a virtual museum of bad acting."
0,Fresh,"I, Daniel Blake is stark, plainspoken and predictable. Maybe a movie that makes the case for treating society's most vulnerable people with respect should be."
0,Fresh,"Pixar clearly still have the edge when it comes to organic storytelling, but if Dreamworks' latest effort is anything to go by then visually at least the playing field has been levelled."
1,Rotten,"This time out, they've apparently hit bottom."
0,Fresh,Doc on Baghdad's only heavy metal band provides fascinating insights into war-torn country.
0,Fresh,McDonagh is less saturated in film and pop culture than Tarantino and less prone than Kaufman to disappear down story wormholes.
0,Fresh,A first-rate tearjerker in the tradition of The Notebook and Ghost...the movie moves briskly enough to earn its tears without wallowing. It even provides some hearty laughs along the way.
0,Fresh,Gorgeous Tuscan scenery and a breakthrough performance by Liv Tyler help make this sudsy flick entertaining.
1,Rotten,"Too sweet and eager to please for its own good, Stuck on You signifies the Farrelly brothers continued descent toward medicority."
1,Rotten,"If Angelina Jolie ever desired to direct a rampaging killer crocodile film, I'm positive it would look a lot like this."
0,Fresh,"Perfectly likable characters, played by fondly remembered former stars, are dispatched bloodily."
0,Fresh,"For all the action (and there is plenty) in Cold in July, it's really more of a psychological suspense movie, and the three principal actors are so good that I can forgive the derivative nature of the plot..."
0,Fresh,An enjoyable action flick.
1,Rotten,Alexander meet Ivan; you're both terrible
1,Rotten,"With all the promise to be the year's best teen scream flick, Disturbia gets lost while overly trying to please its demographic."
0,Fresh,"It's the best film I've seen about the low self-esteem, sexual inadequacy and fear that lead some men to abuse women."
0,Fresh,The beauty of this film - like the two before - is its natural flow of conversation and ability to engage and transport us into the moment
0,Fresh,By far the best film of this first half of 2006.
1,Rotten,"Just My Luck is a deserted wasteland when it comes to funny. It's also boring, plain and simple."
1,Rotten,"The comedy is hit-or-miss, while Wayans proves to be a huge fan of Hong Kong action flicks, ripping off a number of action sequences from them."
0,Fresh,"Skins is a wrenching, uncompromisingly bleak film, but its stars ... fill the screen with warmth, humor and spiritual yearning in the face of hardship and tragedy."
0,Fresh,"Without sacrificing any of the fun and thrills of a murder mystery, Johnson toys with the basic structure and expectations of a well-worn genre."
1,Rotten,"So predictable and formulaic, caught up in the stereotypical slasher movie genre, that it becomes just another Halloween sequel, not capturing any of the sensory prelude to terror that Carpenter so perfectly parlayed."
1,Rotten,"It feels less like a remake of a revered classic so much as it feels like The Fifth Element without the joy, Blade Runner without the artistry or Total Recall without the self awareness and loveable campiness."
0,Fresh,Offers a nostalgic glimpse back at a band that made lasting music and enjoyed massive success despite its own drug abuse and malfunction.
0,Fresh,"By not trying too hard, this remake of a dumb movie has got spring in its step."
1,Rotten,"Winter's War is a kind of poor man's Lord of the Rings, only if you swapped out Sauron with Elsa from Disney's Frozen."
0,Fresh,"Working from a script by TV actor Dylan Haggerty, [director] Araki manages to capture what he's been trying to say all along about the lives of the stoned and indifferent with the kind of effortlessness those earlier attempts sorely lacked."
0,Fresh,"Without question, one of the finest films to be released this year...consummate filmmaking"
0,Fresh,U-s-a! U-s-a!
1,Rotten,"I would call it Ludacris, but then he's voicing the main character."
1,Rotten,... there's little wit or genuine suspense to elevate the proceedings above the level of a cheesy comic book.
1,Rotten,"Though the concept has the ability to become something truly original and scary, [director] Wilson botches it..."
1,Rotten,...the feel of an old-school weeper...
1,Rotten,"By trying to turn Birth into a thriller, the filmmakers undermine its intriguing issues."
0,Fresh,"The LEGO Movie 2 isn't quite as funny or as brilliantly executed as the original, but it's an ambitious, likable sequel."
1,Rotten,"While there is plenty to hold our interest in William Wilberforce's noble battle to abolish slavery in 18th Century Britain, as a film, Amazing Grace is overzealous and gets bogged down by details"
0,Fresh,"Mills puts so much of himself into his work, you can almost see yourself."
1,Rotten,"Venom is a bad movie. There is no questioning that. However, if you are in the right mindset, it's still incredibly watchable as a so-bad-its-good hot mess."
0,Fresh,"It's an eloquent, observant and mature comedy about the decay of an era."
0,Fresh,"Pierrot is a mess, no matter how many times you see it, but it's a brilliant mess. Death of love, (re)birth of cinema."
1,Rotten,"If you ever saw The Devil Wears Prada, you know Blunt can be the most dynamic, scene stealing, vivacious actress on the screen. What happened?!?!?!"
0,Fresh,"The nastier the movie gets, the more fun it is to watch."
1,Rotten,"Period drama has simmering conflict, lacks resolution."
1,Rotten,"Tesla is stacked with potential: talented performers, brilliant yet tortured historical figure, and modern solutions to narrative tropes. Unfortunately, it fails to find its footing and a steady tone."
0,Fresh,"If Abrahamson were as gifted with a camera as he was with his cast (he inspires subtlety even from the tiny Tremblay), Room could have been truly worthy of the astonishing performances that provide its foundation."
1,Rotten,The film is full of the signifiers of musical devotion but lacks the hummably acerbic insight of the best music it namechecks.
0,Fresh,"FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), brainiac cannibal Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) and tackle-tucking serial killer Jame Gumb (Ted Levine) make for one of cinema's great ménages à trois."
1,Rotten,"With humor that makes Bill & Ted seem intelligent, this sequel is pretty much garbage. We had to wait five years for this?"
0,Fresh,"We leave the theatre feeling like we've been through something, even if we may not be able to articulate exactly what the hell it was."
0,Fresh,A lovely surprise from director Julius Avery who demonstrates that entertainment and intelligence are not destined to be apart. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,Diaz and Segel manage to coax a few laughs out of a thin premise but there's nothing they can do with director Jake Kasdan's lame and surprisingly tame slapstick.
0,Fresh,"It's a well-made, provocative movie. And in a great big universe searching for intelligent content, one would hope there's still room for that."
0,Fresh,"The obvious comparison is to 'Lord of the Rings' -- but when Peter Jackson creates the most awe-inspiring battle scene since Kurosawa, the bar is too high for Andrew Adamson."
1,Rotten,"Given a choice between a dark film with comic elements and a comedy that purports to be edgy, the filmmakers took the easy way out."
1,Rotten,Feels like inadvertent misogynist psychodrama.
1,Rotten,"Luc Besson's screenplay is dumb, but has just enough weird touches to give occasional glimmers of interest."
1,Rotten,"For this viewer the whole thing ran out of steam halfway through. A general flat affect, mirrored in visuals and performance, eventually stopped being funny."
0,Fresh,Clavell's script successfully treads a fine line between black comedy and po-faced seriousness.
0,Fresh,"Amazingly, the film arrives not as a pale copy but in an adrenaline rush, an exciting and violent action film that's very much an original."
1,Rotten,Östlund asking [his social questions] seeks inciting a reaction and yet my experience watching The Square was one of indifference instead.
0,Fresh,"The grandiose verbiage can be a bit much, but Remsen is an intelligent filmmaker with a lot to say, and she creates an introspective family portrait."
1,Rotten,...a coming-of-age tableau that is neither inspirational nor uplifting.
1,Rotten,"With only an occasional laugh here and there, this is just another of the many stinky comedies to come around in years."
0,Fresh,"Panic achieves what a plethora of gangster films never approaches: a human-scale portrayal of the psyches of the mobsters, one which demonstrates that not all mercenaries are happy with their sordid work."
0,Fresh,"While steel-plated cars bristling with firepower are guaranteed to get adolescent hearts stirring, the movie offers myriad pleasures for adults."
1,Rotten,An almost excessively beautiful aestheticization of misery.
0,Fresh,"13 Going on 30, directed with a sweet touch by Gary Winick (Tadpole), is an immensely likable if unchallenging comedy."
0,Fresh,"A wild and free-wheeling action film, vastly superior to this year's Rumble in the Bronx in both plot and action."
0,Fresh,"At his best, [Pete] Davidson projects a ragged authenticity and it's that sense of authenticity that allows The King of Staten Island to get by, even when the movie begins to lose itself in its final going."
0,Fresh,The most delightfully original children's film of 2001.
0,Fresh,Wind River is a thrilling and deep meditation on life. Jeremy Renner gives a career best performance.

1,Rotten,Elegant but cold and meandering homage to film noir.
0,Fresh,"Those expecting a load of laughs will be disappointed. All in all, it is good to see this usually comedic cast do some truly dramatic work."
0,Fresh,"The Anti-Social Network, and a stylishly creepy invasion of privacy cyber-thriller, despite an overabundance of cheesy gore. As anti-online techie terrorists go about homicidally deleting digital junkies everywhere, with You've Got Mauled deranged glee."
0,Fresh,"What makes it work is it is grounded in real life. It's a story and a character study with a strong philosophical framework and people that are recognisably human. Factor in superb filmmaking, saturated sensual natural light and cinematography."
0,Fresh,"Standard Operating Procedure never offers concrete answers; it lets the perpetrators explain themselves straight into the camera, and we're left to sift through the testimonies."
1,Rotten,It's painful to think that a high school crowd might actually flock to this irresponsible goofball comedy.
0,Fresh,"It's incredible that Clint Eastwood can make one of his best films so late into his career and so soon after one of his worst, American Sniper."
0,Fresh,It's what indie filmmaking ought to be.
1,Rotten,"It is unremittingly agonizing to sit through this nonsensical, feeble attempt at comedy, lowlighted by Kate McKinnon's unappealing, annoying performance that's like a grain of sand in your eye."
0,Fresh,"Never mind the G rating, this is scary stuff which sent my little one fleeing to another room inside of 10 minutes."
0,Fresh,"It's hard not to want just a little bit more. But as a single volume take on one of the most fascinating entertainers to ever live, Quincy will do just fine."
0,Fresh,This cinematic gem offers an understanding of human nature while satirizing the age-old battle of the sexes and outdated class distinctions. Another winning ingredient is the endearing musical score from composer Philippe Rombi.
0,Fresh,"I didn't gain any great insights from U-571, but I had a blast watching it."
0,Fresh,[Satanic Panic] successfully swings a sledgehammer at the moneyed elite-satiric service it delivers with a devilish smile.
0,Fresh,...a depressing introduction to the duplicity of adulthood.
0,Fresh,"The Grinch"" succeeds in capturing Dr. Seuss' world via digital animation, but as a holiday revival of a classic story it may succeed in inspiring viewers to seek the original 1966 version."
1,Rotten,"In short, we are not satisfied. For starters, it lacks the heart Eva Green's Vesper gave the previous film. Like Bond, we miss her."
1,Rotten,Mind-boggling miscalculations strangle this adaptation of Alice Hoffman's popular novel before it can find its feet.
1,Rotten,It's a shame more effort wasn't made to come up with a storyline as bracingly original and anarchic as the TV series was.

0,Fresh,...unique and arresting.
0,Fresh,There's nothing like the end of civilization as we know it to rouse a rudderless slacker into action.
1,Rotten,"An emphasis on superficial gloss and prettiness suggest that this is a vanity project driven by Jolie the actress, rather than a serious attempt by Jolie the director."
0,Fresh,"While there is some humor in the movie, I would have liked more of that and less of the several scenes featuring characters stoically waiting to die. I can't really blame them for their fatalistic outlook since the Empire is indestructible."
0,Fresh,"All told, Ellison is a fascinating person to spend 96 minutes with. But you probably shouldn't risk that 97th."
0,Fresh,"Milk achieves what it sets out to do, telling an inspiring tale of one man's quest to legitimize his identity, to give hope to his community."
1,Rotten,The biggest lesson from Spinning Into Butter has nothing to do with the ethics of race and more with realizing that every hit play doesn't need to be turned into a movie.
0,Fresh,It could have been great if it had dared to take itself seriously.
1,Rotten,"De Maupassant's story was subtitled ""The History of a Scoundrel""; this is more like ""The Summary of a Scamp."""

1,Rotten,"Frivolous, yes, but never dull."
1,Rotten,"A sluggish narrative is further hampered by ""comic"" turns (Juliet Stevenson, as a gurning governess) and some frankly shameless knockoffs."
1,Rotten,"While enjoyable in parts, its episodic pacing lets down the real-life story of a bold and remarkable woman."
1,Rotten,"Parise no doubt intends the pic's attention to the disease -- + animal adoption and fair trade coffee -- to be socially enlightening, but it feels suspiciously like sympathy-mongering."
0,Fresh,an electric feature debut from director Shannon Murphy and writer Rita Kalnejais
1,Rotten,"Conventional in all but the odd detail, such as that death-by-chopsticks bit, Kiss of the Dragon is an appallingly violent and bloody study of the predictable."
0,Fresh,Have a Kleenex handy.
1,Rotten,The paranoiac aspects of the film and a good and sympathetic performance by Mira Sorvino make this otherwise wandering and pointlessly over-long film considerably more watchable than it would be otherwise.
0,Fresh,"If it's all a touch connect-the-dots in story and style, these two gifted actors elevate the material, and shine in it."
0,Fresh,"Each film is enriched by collective detail, but it would have been richer had they played off each other rather than extending the argument."
0,Fresh,"Graphically depicts the horrors inflicted on an innocent woman in an Iranian village, the result of a fatal combination of a patriarchal society, tribal traditions, and Islamic fundamentalism."
0,Fresh,"Even though it's just a cartoon, ""Rio"" captures Brazil vibrantly, not just in the vividly colored jungle and the carnival parades but also in the rhythmic music, which was supervised by samba maestro Sergio Mendes."
1,Rotten,"When Pitka ends his bite-size lessons with 'TM,' we should understand it's not meditation but branding he's after."
0,Fresh,"The result, a defiant slap at slick Hollywood formula, is mesmerizing."
0,Fresh,"It reconfirms McQueen as a filmmaker with an unflinching, microscopic gaze on the world."
1,Rotten,"Land of the Lost is halfway toward amusing, which means it's just as close to awful."
0,Fresh,Well-crafted and effectively creepy.
0,Fresh,One of the more interesting and absurdly entertaining mind puzzles. Should not be overlooked or ignored since it comes from one of the most inventive filmmakers working today.

0,Fresh,A film with a vibrant rhythm and an overwhelming feeling of asphyxiation. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"This is not to say that Transsiberian is wall-to-wall dread. Once it gets going...it delivers enough electricity to keep us right near, if not completely on, the edge of our seats."
1,Rotten,"""Twice Born"" chokes to death on its own melodrama."
1,Rotten,"It needs to be more than a surface show of what we know. Drugs are bad, but so is giving up a family and a life without a reason that's, well, galvanizing."
1,Rotten,"Like its protagonist, too cautious for its own good."
1,Rotten,Let's face it: 'To thine own self be true' is not exactly late breaking news.
0,Fresh,"It's obvious and refreshing to see a slasher film with a gender perspective, directed and written by women. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,The Rape of Europa presents iconic images that viewers who aren't schooled in European art will recognize. That's a good way to connect with the film and understand the enormity of the pillage by Hitler and his cronies.
0,Fresh,"50 years after its creation, Star Trek is alive and well."
0,Fresh,"To give the narrative depth, bite, or oomph, as naturalism, irony, or romance, or some combination ... Morgan would have to have invented more (as Shakespeare and Schiller did with their historical royalty)...."
0,Fresh,"Thanks to a caffeinated cast and hyperactive script, director Ron Howard delivers The Paper with a bang."
0,Fresh,Haneke demands full attention as a patriarchal community crumbles to the ground and the seeds of fascism are sown. A masterpiece.
0,Fresh,"Relentlessly respectful, yet lacking the intense emotional punch that would have made it great."
0,Fresh,"I think something this beautifully orchestrated will find itself tossed around when the Oscar nominations are announced. And if that happens, it will be richly deserved."
0,Fresh,"While I have really liked several femme performances this year..., Dame Meryl (the only reason the US should consider having royalty) stands out amongst them all."
0,Fresh,"This film has so many facets to it, so many characters, all with their own set of problems, that the fact that Tropper and Levy have made it into such a cohesive, entertaining movie is an admirable feat."
0,Fresh,So original in its base concept that you cannot help but get caught up.
0,Fresh,The broodingest franchise on Earth continues with a pretty fascinating action-adventure that is the best of the three films
1,Rotten,"Instead of shades of ambiguity or a structure that quivers upon impact, Sam de Jong, the writer and director of ""Prince,"" depicts a universe in absolute terms. Ayoub's arc from good boy to bad prince is too rapid and uncomplicated."
1,Rotten,...an egregiously familiar romantic comedy that hews far too closely to the well-worn formula that one has come to associate with films of this ilk.
0,Fresh,"Kurosawa at the top of his game, Mifune at his most darkly compelling, and the best realization of Shakespeare ever put to film."
0,Fresh,"A powerful, darkly skewed coming-of-age film that peerlessly makes use of its obscure setting and striking authenticity."
0,Fresh,"A killer bug flick upgraded for the downbeat 70s, a small scale B-picture reworked for the post-2001 hard sci-fi set."
0,Fresh,Definitely go on this Date.
1,Rotten,"The Green Inferno can easily be dismissed as juvenilia, both in its sneering rebuke of political correctness and in its zeal for unearthing a horror tradition that should have been laid to rest."
1,Rotten,"The gradual revelation that there's more to Daisy than meets the eye is no great surprise, but it does at least negate - too late! - some of the more troubling subtext."
1,Rotten,"This is a movie with lots of great cuisine, and precious little flava."
0,Fresh,"As vastly expensive pieces of set tumble everywhere one cannot help but consider that white elephants, whilst they mat be a burden to keep, are splendid things to look at."
0,Fresh,"It is a simple, familiar story brought to life uniquely and touchingly."
1,Rotten,"I did laugh a few times, but I equally found myself smacking my forehead in annoyance of how stupid these characters were sometimes."
0,Fresh,"Better than the original, funnier than the original, and suddenly imbued with a fiercer intelligence, albeit filtered through a whimsically insipid concept."
0,Fresh,"Very, very '80s, but lots of fun too."
0,Fresh,Director Paul McGuigan and cast infuse the proceedings with a strong dose of psychotic gusto and visual flare.
0,Fresh,This hard-assed film is based on a prison work by Eddie Little. It is only fun to watch in between heists.
0,Fresh,"There have been many documentaries comprised entirely out of archival footage, but few as powerfully and masterfully structured as this one."
0,Fresh,"Jenkins and Martindale, both old hands at this sort of ""dramedy"" material, come through for Krasinski as the story darkens in the second half."
1,Rotten,"Definitely not funny, and not appropriate for young teenagers! Yuck!"
1,Rotten,A well-crafted letdown.
0,Fresh,"The film equivalent of a familiar, not too special song that's been brilliantly re-arranged and performed."
1,Rotten,"With a million times more computing power at its disposal than its 1982 predecessor, Tron: Legacy still looks like Disco Night at the jai alai fronton."
1,Rotten,"One look at the youthful, idealistic guerrillas, accompanied everywhere by folk music, and you know where Mr. Stone's heart lies."
0,Fresh,Gets extra credit for trying something different.
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, the performances are (rightly) more involving than the story. By the same token, the actors are more involving than the film."
1,Rotten,Kidman and Hopkins are not on top of their games here; he looks bored and she tries too hard.
0,Fresh,"Four Feathers will please those of us who've been waiting to get lost in a historical epic. It isn't flawless, but then how many of those great old films were?"
1,Rotten,At the heart of the problem with this period piece is an absence of a riveting scene or a memorable slice of dialogue.
1,Rotten,"Careful to follow all the clichés and conventions of the Conjuring franchise, Annabelle Creation ends up overlong and bum-numbingly repetitive."
0,Fresh,You'll leave your scepticism at the door if you're going to have a good time here.
0,Fresh,There's no larger message other than that greed gives us something to hold on to even as it kills us.
1,Rotten,There isn't much about Virus that you won't know by guessing.
1,Rotten,"A dull, simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs, death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets."
0,Fresh,Daniel Day-Lewis remains our greatest actor. Even if just for one last film.
0,Fresh,"There's a purity, clarity and honesty to this feminist heart-warmer's melodramatic instincts that make it surprisingly moving and satisfying."
0,Fresh,"What saves us from restlessness is superb acting, especially from Collins as the enigmatically gentle killer and the magnificent Hoffman."
0,Fresh,It slowly builds from a languid romance into a psychological thriller that is both compelling and unnerving.
1,Rotten,"Their doomy romance is supposed to be fated, but it just seems sloggy, certainly not the stuff of myth."
1,Rotten,"Why hire Fanning, a gifted performer under the right circumstances, and then waste her presence on a nothing role?"
0,Fresh,A creepy good time -- and perhaps a surprisingly emotional one -- will be had by all.
0,Fresh,"Rocky III marks the point where the series starts to get silly, but the end result is so enjoyable that it's hard to carp too much."
0,Fresh,I found this film hysterically funny and quite thought-provoking.
0,Fresh,A uniquely personal vision of one person's world ending and how that can feel as big and as tangible as an actual apocalypse.
0,Fresh,"Point and Shoot is a riveting documentary and a disturbing portrait of a pampered American's ""crash course in manhood."""
0,Fresh,"In the end, it's a movie with multiple-personality disorder, but most of its personalities are fun to hang with."
1,Rotten,Bonello might as well have shown him sleeping eight hours or using the toilet for all that says about the man and his work.
1,Rotten,"Sonic The Hedgehog can pretend it's in good fun to run amok with branded content, but it isn't fooling anyone. This wasn't a movie, it was a boardroom meeting with some poor hapless dreamer strapped to the ""directed by"" credit..."
0,Fresh,It's good fun that engages our heart.
0,Fresh,"Shot like a photo album, gorgeous frame after gorgeous frame, it continually suggests that crisis and struggle can be beautiful when viewed from the right angle."
1,Rotten,The film ultimately didn't deliver enough balls to back its ballsy premise.
1,Rotten,"On film, the story's charm fades fast."
0,Fresh,An unusually fulsome tribute to the singer-songwriter from the director of The Silence of the Lambs.
0,Fresh,"With visceral power, they show how the support of Burma's monks gave vital authority to the protests."
0,Fresh,"Right from the start, Cuaron aims for the moon - and hits it."
0,Fresh,"The story of the ramen empire is one of constant rise with no fall in sight. In Ramen Heads, it's told through the seemingly narrow lens of one proponent of that dish that is so much more than a noodle soup."
1,Rotten,The weakest of the seven X-Men [films]. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,A better-and-smarter-than-average humans-vs.-monsters spectacular.
0,Fresh,It's a wonderfully nostalgic if somewhat antiseptic reminder of what it meant to first break the bonds of Earth.
0,Fresh,"The picture's really about the trials and joys of performing for a living so it's no surprise that it has attracted such a fine cast, nor that its principal virtue lies in the acting."
0,Fresh,This story does not in the end sink or swim on warfare or anyone's U-boats but on the men who man them and the choices that must be made.
1,Rotten,"Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs."
0,Fresh,A fertile film.
0,Fresh,"McCreadie learns the hard way that some things can't be bought; the catharsis of that particular lesson amounts to its own kind of entertainment, less outright uproarious than satisfying."
1,Rotten,"'Southern Gothic' and 'arthouse' are rarely used to describe the same movie, and Undertow is a prime example of why that is."
1,Rotten,"It has just enough wit and humor to make it to the Grand Ball, but in the end, this fairytale, to those who have seen better, is a clear disappointment."
1,Rotten,So old-fashioned in its effects that it seems positively quaint; it resembles nothing so much as one of those 'scary' primetime telefilms that ABC specialized in during the 1970s.
1,Rotten,"...you could do worse for a summer action comedy, even if The Other Guys eventually comes dangerously close to becoming the kind of generic buddy cop film it means to parody."
0,Fresh,The filmmakers evoke earned emotion with gentle hands. Even the monstrous antagonist is presented in such an unadorned fashion as to make it almost normal - and therefore creepier.
1,Rotten,"Despite an energetic effort by the star, it's not a case of third time lucky."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, the stylish film offers only a few new glimpses of the man."
0,Fresh,"The fancy period costumes and bleak, lived-in settings may be strictly Britain in 1912, but the rage and passion feel strictly contemporary in the history-based Suffragette."
0,Fresh,"""Meet the Robinsons"" has more eye candy than a Toys ""R"" Us holiday catalog and enough wacky characters to keep folks glued to the screen."
0,Fresh,It will make you tear up and not because of Emilia Clarke's eyebrows. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"I stopped laughing because after 20 minutes, I'd had enough. The conceit gets stale fast."
0,Fresh,"Consistently funny and brutally honest, Dig! is a great addition to the rockumentary genre."
0,Fresh,"In the end, The Village poses a thoughtful parable about bliss and ignorance. For Shyamalan of late, that's a twist."
0,Fresh,"This politicized Faustian tale is a provocative and shrewd blend of fact and fiction in the case of a naive doctor seduced into Amin's political apparatus, but film suffers from problems of other political-horror sagas told from strictly white POV."
1,Rotten,"The result is a sort of Flashdance for the Teletubbies set, not as obnoxiously atrocious as The Nut Job 2 (let's hope that record stands for a while), but really no better."
0,Fresh,"The level of authenticity within the intriguing character dynamics, bolstered by fine performances, provides some sensitively rendered surprises amid the obligatory relationship dirty laundry."
1,Rotten,Danny Boyle seems to have had a blast making Trance. It's a pity he makes it so difficult to share in his joy.
0,Fresh,"It turns out that the added years only benefit the character, making him seem touchingly new because he's so old."
0,Fresh,"A wonderful film about film cloaked in an emotional and deeply rewarding, multi-layered children's tale ."
1,Rotten,Considering the incendiary subject matter - the use of torture to extract information - this political thriller should be a lot more compelling than it is.
0,Fresh,"True to the director's passion for fashion, Firth's wardrobe is an example of sartorial splendor."
0,Fresh,Stanley Tucci's wonderfully camp voice performance should make adults sit up and stay.
0,Fresh,"The ingenious debut of writer-director Shane Carruth, who assembled the film on his home computer and also plays one of the two leads, is purposely designed to be a little bewildering."
1,Rotten,"No offense to Sir Ben, who does a mean deadpan, but his performance here is frequently more dead than pan -- which, given the material, was probably the wisest acting choice."
0,Fresh,"A platform for showcasing some excellent British talent in an old-fashioned, but strikingly modern way that is sure to bring its younger stars to cinema-goers' attention."
0,Fresh,"A sour, disenchanted war comedy that affects a breezy style, The Hunting Party was originally called Spring Break in Bosnia."
1,Rotten,An ill-conceived weeper that just won't say die.
0,Fresh,"The results may get muddled when tonal shifts are forced, but Eddie nonetheless entertains with enough originality to forgive its otherwise familiar tropes."
0,Fresh,It's a gruesome bit of a cat and mouse entertainment that will likely appease genre hounds while it frustrates and annoys anyone looking for something more substantive.
1,Rotten,"The film is flat and lifeless, squandering a decent concept, an excellent cast and an engaging aesthetic."
1,Rotten,"Ghostbusters 2.0 suffers from the anxiety of influence - or, more specifically, from the fear of not wanting to alienate the fans (Gen X'ers and others) of 1.0."
0,Fresh,"A must-see: an hour and twenty-five minutes of lean gripping cinematic heaven ... razor-tight, superbly plotted, intricate and surprising."
0,Fresh,Uneven but often strangely compelling.
1,Rotten,Elite Squad can't decide whether it wants to pull the lid back on what urban decay has wrought or simply open up a can of whup ass.
0,Fresh,"[Riseborough's] work is indrawn and riveting. It's hard to read the look in her eye, but we never stop trying."
0,Fresh,Like The Bad News Bears but with much higher stakes.
1,Rotten,"Not even his magnificent horse, which drinks and smokes, can tap dance the film into my heart. Thank goodness the music has been retained; at least you can revel in the score."
1,Rotten,Shanghai Knights is a mess. A few ground rules would have helped immensely.
0,Fresh,"It's a film about the unsustainable condition of being poor and alive, which admittedly sounds like a grueling experience. But I, Daniel Blake seeks understanding -- it seeks to connect -- and understanding is innately hopeful."
1,Rotten,Dark and often scary '80s fantasy hasn't aged well.
1,Rotten,"As B-level suspensers go, though, The Return isn't actively awful -- just slow and cursed with a lead who acts with her T-shirt."
0,Fresh,The most engrossingly eccentric American movie of the year.
0,Fresh,"Among the very best, frankest, and most honest of recent literary adaptations."
1,Rotten,"You see ""Runner Runner's"" hand before it's played, and there's nothing to keep you playing."
0,Fresh,"With surprising presence and quiet confidence, The Rock has cooked up a winner."
1,Rotten,"Battle of the Year clearly features lots of brilliant dancers, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy watching them move. But you wish there were more dancing here."
0,Fresh,"Craven and company tap into something hot, dark and deep."
0,Fresh,"Though How to Be Single marks progress from the standard genre narrative and gives Alice in particular a chance to be herself, it's not a clean win. But I certainly had fun getting dirty with it."
1,Rotten,"Like the director's previous films, it offers intriguing ideas and cool visuals before completely falling apart as a story."
1,Rotten,"There are some funny moments, mostly with the kids, but a lot of this comedy falls as flat as a deflated soccer ball."
1,Rotten,[Immortals] just doesn't feel much like a movie -- it's not cheesy enough to be an old-fashioned sword and sandals flick and it's not consistent enough to effectively appeal to contemporary emotions.
1,Rotten,"Sadly enough, with all the things Candyman has going for it, it turns out to be not much more enthralling than the last Freddy Kreuger slash-o-rama."
0,Fresh,This is fiercely original and seriously funny.
0,Fresh,'Star Trek Beyond' is an outer-space thrill ride.
1,Rotten,"Comedy with heart is nice, but not if it gets in the way of the laughs."
0,Fresh,So beautifully made that it comes close to perfect.
0,Fresh,"On one level, the film becomes a celebration of a film buff that would appeal to other cinephiles."
0,Fresh,"Beautifully filmed, with Mulligan's special gifts for depicting country life and the South."
0,Fresh,A minor classic in fantasy film circles with marvelous Harryhausen effects.
0,Fresh,"Crazy? Yes! The flick also happens to be hilariously, dangerously, weirdly funny."
0,Fresh,Always mesmerizing film has few faults.
0,Fresh,The Terminal is one of those films that is so warm and fuzzy you want to cuddle up on the couch with it.
0,Fresh,Bloody well done. Hammer finally gave the Dracula legend the treatment it deserved here.
0,Fresh,A strange thing happened from the 25-minute mark: I began to be charmed by this film.
1,Rotten,You don't have to be a Beat cultist to wonder why these brilliant and transgressive volcanoes of authentic cool are so friggin' boring.
0,Fresh,"Admirable, affecting, and humbling."
0,Fresh,"The Intruder is an interesting mix using themes from Rebecca, The Philadelphia Experiment, and Ghost."
0,Fresh,"Hal Ashby's gritty and profane serio comedy is one of his best films, featuring a towering performance from Jack Nicholson."
0,Fresh,A blast to watch if for nothing more than the performances.
0,Fresh,"The Eagle is not your typical sword and sandal epic. You could easily mistake it for a western, a war movie or even a timely commentary on the human casualties of 21st century conflict."
1,Rotten,"A 'thriller' with no mystery and no suspense whose doltish detective can't even track down his own soon-to-be-dead body, the only award The Invisible is likely to contend for is Cheesiest Use of a Death Cab for Cutie Song in a Teen Movie."
0,Fresh,"The real subjects -- and strengths -- in this narrowly focused biopic are the two women who, more than any one else, were responsible for molding the future star's psyche."
0,Fresh,"Blood spluttered it may be, but Peele shows his worth twofold as a master of the psychological horror aficionado who is on to the path to greatness."
0,Fresh,"Director Lynne Ramsay cuts away anything thrilling, or even compelling. It's a vigilante movie so aestheticized that it loses its energy - knuckle sandwiches with the crusts cut off, served on a doily."
0,Fresh,Is it really possible that this bears repeating? The Godfather is extraordinary.
0,Fresh,"American Hardcore is a raucous, relevant documentary, capturing the mood of the times and the participants' best anecdotes."
1,Rotten,"begins the downward, juvenile trend of tarzan mgm movies."
0,Fresh,Ejiofor gives the audience more emotion with a glance than most actors could muster with an entire page of dialogue.
0,Fresh,...a different kind of modern Western; one where confrontations are deflected and firearms feel impotent. What is most important about these stories is the Beckettian persistence of these women. They can't go on. They go on.
1,Rotten,"""High-Rise"" is a highbrow genre art film that is ultimately unappealing. Its attempts at sophistication fall short and its story is too chaotic and laid out in a way that is incoherent."
0,Fresh,The result's highly effective on a human level. If only the film had been set in the real world.
1,Rotten,Nothing was resolved in the end except for the fact that I hated it.
0,Fresh,Casual fans will wonder what all the complaining is about. Obsessives already know why Spectre is far from fantastic.
1,Rotten,It lacks [My Favourite Year's] winning charm.
0,Fresh,"Even when the pace wanes, the images are still gripping."
0,Fresh,Some of the action is jaw-dropping.
0,Fresh,"Sam Mendes's film, based on a faithful screenplay by Justin Haythe, is beautifully crafted."
0,Fresh,"A gem, captured in the unhurried, low-key style favored by many directors of the Iranian new wave."
1,Rotten,"Desperate to be something, 3 Days to Kill chooses to be everything, resulting in an extraordinarily confused feature that's all over the map in terms of tone and execution."
1,Rotten,Pretty forgettable Eastwood runs out of gas.
0,Fresh,"Yes, this is a Steven Spielberg picture. He directed it and, like Blondie in the old song, he's gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, one way or another."
0,Fresh,"As Curry jumps between his interview, Vandyke's footage, and eventually news broadcasts, you may find your impression of his subject in flux. It's a great psychological portrait, even as we're always aware of image modeling."
1,Rotten,"The no-brow acting, oversimplifying of the path to success and supersappy ending are only some of the film's fatal flaws."
0,Fresh,"It goes to character, visual and thematic places that the show's never gone to before. Making it bigger really works."
0,Fresh,"Despite all the cursing and envelope-pushing and bat-bleep crazy sexual stuff, Sausage Party isn't mean-spirited. It's just... stupid. But also pretty smart. And funny as hell."
0,Fresh,"Relentlessly bleak from the first frame, this final outing pulls no punches as white knuckle action sequences see the casualty rate rise alongside the tension."
0,Fresh,"For me, Germinal provided visual and dramatic images for 19th century history events that I only understood in an abstract way."
0,Fresh,"Despite its absurdist premise, and the danger of falling into Groundhog Day repetitiveness, 50 First Dates is convincing and works remarkably well."
0,Fresh,"Allied proves that Zemeckis can still tell great, small-scaled stories, crafting a tight, compelling period drama driven by a pair of fantastic lead performances."
0,Fresh,"Although the two halves of the The Children Act don't coalesce as they should, Thompson gracefully keeps the whole from falling apart."
0,Fresh,"Evolution is a stunning cinematic experience that is both beautiful and utterly engaging, and it will prompt further discussion and reward repeat viewing."
0,Fresh,If the second film never reaches the highs of the first -- we have met the players before and there are no new worlds of wonder -- it nonetheless invests moviegoing with a sense of adventure.
1,Rotten,"One thing that can be said for the film, it does have a high energy level and lots of action, even if it is all preposterous."
1,Rotten,This is a little movie and should have a brief running time. The editor must have been asleep at his desk.
1,Rotten,"Not a waste of time, but not quite in control of its destination."
0,Fresh,A great film to breathe new life into a classic franchise.
1,Rotten,"For all the film's stabs at broad comedy and its ambition in terms of story layers, Striptease is a mishmash of failed gags, uneven performances and boring strip-club sequences."
1,Rotten,"It's almost hard to believe that this bland, fluffy, two-generational chick flick is helmed by the same director who 20 years ago gave us Heathers, one of the brightest and sharpest femme-driven high-school satires."
0,Fresh,One of those fascinating horror movies that never gets too weird to lose its footing but also stays completely unpredictable.
0,Fresh,If you love films (and Paris) then this omnibus edition is strongly recommended.
1,Rotten,"These flashbacks consist of a lot of screaming and door slamming, but they don't really explain what the problem is between these two."
1,Rotten,"Despite an intriguing premise and a few scenes that work really well, this is one of those horror films that get sillier as they go along."
0,Fresh,"As he has throughout his career, Linklater proves himself as a filmmaker unconcerned with flash and dazzle but thoroughly compassionate and empathetic to a wide range of characters."
0,Fresh,"There's a lot to like about The Woods, but it never really takes root."
0,Fresh,Gorgeously straightforward yet emotional.
0,Fresh,"A terrific documentary directed by Mark Craig and executive-produced by Sir Jackie Stewart, among others."
0,Fresh,Dwayne Johnson has an elaborate melee fight through a bazaar that is so in tune with actual video games it is impossible not to start playing air controller with synchronized button presses to him emphatically announcing his every action
0,Fresh,"Every bit as visceral and provocative as the original, but cinematographer Enrique Chediak's deserted London can't hold a candle to Anthony Dod Mantle's."
1,Rotten,"Rare for Mamet, that talk here sometimes comes off as strained and awkward, or as a slightly highbrow variation on the usual hackneyed bon mots of generic action films."
0,Fresh,"Thanks to the able cast and crisp cinematography, it's mostly unpretentious and reasonably entertaining."
0,Fresh,"The pros, including sharp dialogue from a triumvirate of writers including Bourne scribbler Tony Gilroy, outweigh the cons in a polished, engrossing whydunnit you'll want to see more than once."
1,Rotten,"Like a nuclear arsenal launched by an insane despot, Michael Bay's ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" aims for a million different targets and incinerates them beyond recognition."
0,Fresh,"Charles Lane's follies are enmeshed within bigger pictures of reality, reestablishing the film's thesis of comedy as a mode of survival."
1,Rotten,I just wish it had had the courage to be honest rather than using a gimmick about lying.
0,Fresh,A rousing adventure that's enjoyable even if it still feels rather sanitised
0,Fresh,"[A] spare, superbly tingling psychological thriller."
0,Fresh,"'Minions' swings wildly from inventive and hilarious, to oddly dark and boring in stretches."
0,Fresh,"It's a movie I can imagine kids actually liking, as opposed to one that clueless studio executives merely want them to like."
0,Fresh,"I admire Cooper's restraint, an attribute I've admired in Bridges for so many years."
0,Fresh,"If you are expecting this movie to be Iron Man, you will be disappointed, but it is 1000 times better than the abomination that Ang Lee created back in 2003. No pun intended."
1,Rotten,Uses its WB pretty boys as a lure -- but the only ones biting are the laughable bloodsuckers of the title.
0,Fresh,Compelling watching.
0,Fresh,"Waves is, simply put, the greatest film of the year. Everything Shults has crafted before has built to this, a magnum opus of brutal emotional devastation and healing amelioration."
0,Fresh,"Now that CGI can conjure up anything, the challenge to film-makers is to increase their inventiveness. Jackson rises effortlessly to that."
1,Rotten,"The usual Emmerich-style approach to 'Stonewall' would have been dodgy, maybe even offensive, but so is this one"
1,Rotten,"Even if we take that misplaced bit of armchair psychiatry out, The Secret Life of Pets 2 simply isn't good."
0,Fresh,"Anthropomorphism is generally kept to reasonable levels, and the total effect conveys real respect for nature."
0,Fresh,"Director Satyajit Ray forever changed the face of India's immense film industry with this uniquely personal, practically homemade, trilogy."
1,Rotten,Owen Wilson crashes a marriage.
0,Fresh,"James William Guercio was the producer of Chicago albums in the Seventies, and this is his only directorial effort."
0,Fresh,A children's fable reimagined as a superhero flick--a peculiar but delightful hybrid that just may be the best animated offering of the year.
0,Fresh,"This startlingly accomplished debut feature by Nia DaCosta has the eyes and ears of a documentary-the opioid crisis is everywhere, the nearest hospital is far away-but the heart of a drama, and a stirring one."
0,Fresh,"Blending the clichéd with the new, How To Be Single is a surprise but not a revelation."
0,Fresh,"The argument of Under the Same Moon isn't news to anyone living near the border, but it does present the migrants' problems well and poignantly."
1,Rotten,"You go to America's Sweethearts anticipating a prime flossy, glossy entertainment. You come away better by a few laughs but with expectations sadly deflated."
1,Rotten,"Stupid monikers are just one symptom of a stultifying, overwritten cleverness that substitutes quirk for character."
1,Rotten,...it's the utter familiarity that keeps We Own the Night from standing out on the screen in the same way it undoubtedly did at the pitch meeting.
0,Fresh,"MacDonald's screenplay teases and delays, ramping up the psychological tension and employing a few deft narrative surprises that keep us guessing, especially with regard to the timing of Pyewacket's arrival."
1,Rotten,"[The] elements are in place again, but the story feels less substantial than the Lord of the Rings tales."
1,Rotten,"With its ludicrous frisson of patriotism and a nod to The Da Vinci Code, a more cynical grab for Hollywood gold is hard to imagine."
0,Fresh,"An artful addition to the canon of modern-day crime drama, one whose core mysteries encompass more than just the case at hand."
0,Fresh,"If you've ever wanted to see a partially clothed, fully comical sex scene set to Foreigner's 'I Want to Know What Love Is,' well, this is where you go."
0,Fresh,Jeunet's optical sleights of hand would be hollow if he also didn't create dozens of vivid and frequently lovable characters.
1,Rotten,"Sandler has gained dramatic weight and variety. But if I want to see him play Hamlet, I'd rather have Shakespeare as the scriptwriter."
0,Fresh,"A gritty woman's perspective on tropes of the western genre, a lean action drama that is sparse yet sympathetic, and laconic but simmers with deep emotion."
0,Fresh,"The spooky stuff, of course, makes the journey all the sweeter, delivering what is, if not a terrifying experience, one that is at least thoroughly unnerving."
0,Fresh,From filmmakers Ellen Page and Ian Daniel comes this passionate yet somewhat thin documentary...
1,Rotten,"A paint-by-numbers, creatively bankrupt ""comedy"" emerging from a studio system that has largely forgotten what it means to be genuinely funny."
1,Rotten,"It revels in evil and lacks any sprightliness that might have redeemed its twisted characters, all of whom are loathsome and stupid."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, the is-he-or-isn't-he question...is a red herring... Hollywood's little life lessons are the real point of K-PAX."
0,Fresh,A timely film that still deals with timeless children's themes.
1,Rotten,"Nicholson smirks his way through one of the limpest, phoned-in performances he's given in years."
0,Fresh,Brown lays the sentimentality on so much that it almost brings the whole production down. Luckily there's lots of tremendous shots and a solid story to keep it going.

1,Rotten,"If Kutcher ever quits Hollywood, he can get a job at Guantanamo Bay torturing prisoners with his singing."
1,Rotten,"Color me relieved. There is no need to fear death, even the most horrifying kind of murder. Because the afterlife is exactly like the album cover for a 1970s progressive-rock band."
0,Fresh,"Hilarious, shocking and poignant, careering through your scepticism at 100 miles an hour, it deserves a 5.8 for both technical merit and artistic expression. And despite claiming to put across different points of view it's unashamedly pro-Tonya Harding."
0,Fresh,"Despite the ceaseless yammering, The Social Network delivers the heady, rib-tickling rush of an action picture, and it gradually builds to an emotional wallop that blindsides you."
1,Rotten,"At its foundation, it's a movie I like. It's what's built on that foundation that's troubling."
0,Fresh,[E]njoyable in the way long summer afternoons can be...
0,Fresh,"If Southpaw gets that job done while completing a familiar riches-to-rags-to-redemption trajectory, it is all because of its lead actor Jake Gyllenhaal. His is a heavyweight performance in an otherwise junior-middleweight affair."
1,Rotten,"A true horror film haunting needs depth to get under our skin, to chill us down to the bone. This one can't leave us cold enough."

0,Fresh,"The film is unpredictable in its humour, drama and poignancy, and ends up fascinating."
0,Fresh,It's really a compelling homage with insight into the creative process.
0,Fresh,"A rich portrait of the tenuously connected sets of relationships that, while peripheral in another film, are the whole enchilada here."
0,Fresh,"It's so much fun to watch these cheeky, loveable kids pull together and navigate their way through this extraordinary adventure."
0,Fresh,"Neeson engages in some electrifying close-quarters brawling, and preposterous bits are offset by unanticipated slyness, from our glimpse of a ""You Could Be Home Right Now"" billboard to some hilarious anti-Wall Street shade-throwing."
0,Fresh,"The documentary begins to lose its shape as Siegel ponders the spiritual and cultural impact of the honeybee, but it does succeed in flagging a potentially critical problem."
0,Fresh,"Thrilling, suspenseful and captivating while remaining grounded in humanism. Holliday Grainger gives a truly radiant breakthrough performance. It's the first must-see movie of 2016."
1,Rotten,"Sweat and good intentions, however, will take you only so far. And they take Bees right up to the threshold of entertaining%u2014but not one step further."
0,Fresh,A relaxed and sassy romantic comedy ripe with tart observations on sexual politics.
1,Rotten,The kind of film the tabloids will call to ban. Don't take that as a reason to see it.
0,Fresh,"The narrative occasionally wavers but not Zhao's performance, her best yet."
1,Rotten,"What They Had gracefully coasts on its patient observations of one family's dynamics, but once the third act hits, Elizabeth Chomko goes about neatly tidying up seemingly every loose end."
1,Rotten,"With few exceptions, however-like a particularly awkward moment between Maura and the guy she's trying to woo (Ike Barinholtz)-the scenes generally feel like punch lines in search of something to hold them all together."
0,Fresh,Rasoulof's vision of people in a perpetual state of migration acknowledges the struggle of minorities left to their own devices and their self-devouring instinct in times of crisis.
0,Fresh,"This is a straight-up, no-holds-barred revenge flick starring a leathery Sylvester Stallone - albeit one that struggles to keep an already-thin story together."
1,Rotten,We are told a lot about Jesse James during the elongated run time -- but learn very little about the man at all.
0,Fresh,"This is a film that succeeds on the strength of its acting, which is uniformly brilliant."
0,Fresh,"The primal violence that often binds men has rarely been evoked as intensely ... [Dafoe and Pattinson's] pairing provides a recipe for one unforgettable moment after another as they drink, dance and dispute over everything, from supper to superstitions."
1,Rotten,"This gritty crime drama is so indebted to the work of Michael Mann, it might as well be called Residual Heat."
1,Rotten,"We're always aware of the formula--and in a picture based on real life, we shouldn't be."
1,Rotten,A self-indulgent excuse to employ what now looks like very dated psychedelic 1960s filmmaking techniques.

1,Rotten,A tacky and unintelligent narrative that exists only to puff its chest and prove that not all Latino roles in Hollywood are created equally.
1,Rotten,It's a film teeming with opportunities that were squandered under falsely edgy and unfunny jokes.
0,Fresh,It's creepy for sure... but it's a dead ringer for every Hollywood horror sequel ever created
0,Fresh,"A vigorous, inconclusive film -- for what could it possibly conclude? I feel pretty thankful for its inconclusions."

1,Rotten,"Though violent and thrilling, Bleeding Heart is first and foremost a film about healing."
0,Fresh,"While the ending gets way too noisy, the movie is quite enjoyable."
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, the film is too neat, and too cloyingly sweet to tackle anything resembling real life."
1,Rotten,"Like an overgrown and bloated trailer for a film yet to come, Francis Lawrence's The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 spreads perhaps 45 minutes of dramatic material across two far-too-leisurely hours."
1,Rotten,A bog standard all-girls-together comedy with a decent cast and less impressive characters.
0,Fresh,"Miller is so good -- dumb, smart, wounded, wounding, a lollipop of sweet poison that you'd buy every day until it killed you -- that you feel you not only understand her but all actresses."
1,Rotten,"So much is muddled and just messed up, the fruit of uncertainty rather than bold vision."
1,Rotten,"As a film, it's curious. It feels like an intermediary story."

0,Fresh,"Its atmosphere is spot on, making it a nostalgic treat for many viewers today."
0,Fresh,"Watching Beanie Feldstein's glow-up in How To Build A Girl is just as fantabulous as watching her become the Queen in Coming of Age movies. Everything about this film is hilarious, poignant and heartbreakingly awesome"
1,Rotten,"Shrek has always been a lumbering, heavy-footed fellow, but his first two movies were a lot more nimble than this one."
1,Rotten,"Julien Donkey-Boy, a nihilistic bit of crap that wants to be oh-so-cool but is really just a low-budget exploration of nothing."
0,Fresh,"It maintains an adequate, agile rhythm, in which comedy and action are balanced to present, sometimes, ephemeral scenes that seek to portray a more personal chronicle of Deadpool, but that, equally, end up being satirized. [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,You'll be singing the praises of this charming little French movie.
1,Rotten,"Nebraska, despite a few pleasures, strikes me as Payne's most cartoonish, one-dimensional work."
0,Fresh,"A vastly accomplished bit of commercial filmmaking, with all the payoffs and pitfalls that such faint praise implies."

0,Fresh,The movie is a sick pleasure.
1,Rotten,"As the story develops, the film seems more wishy-washy than pointedly ambiguous."
0,Fresh,"Based on a play by J.C. Lee, this drama is (unsurprisingly) talky and static, but it also tackles complex issues of race, privilege, and expectations in a deliberately inconclusive, provocative way."
0,Fresh,... a riveting account of life among the French Resistance during World War II's Nazi occupation.
0,Fresh,"I laughed out loud a handful of times and chuckled on a regular basis. In the end, isn't that all we really want from those sweet, mindless comedies Hollywood continues to offer?"
1,Rotten,"Both star and director seem to be more interested in playing off perceptions of Gibson's on-screen persona than in actually telling the story, which lurches along from one violent set piece to the next."
0,Fresh,"... filmdom's Everyman geek of a director is a goofy, gooey romantic at heart. Emphasis on the gooey."
0,Fresh,"Wavering uneasily between horror, black comedy and sentimentality, it's held together by Burton's performance, a brave attempt to escape the straitjacket of being the world's highest-paid movie star."

1,Rotten,The worst movie of the franchise. Even God couldn't save it. An embarrassment to the series.
1,Rotten,"...one of those preening film-geek ""tributes"" to an old B-movie with which most people are, shall we say, not intimately familiar."
1,Rotten,Excruciating pap
1,Rotten,"I suspect a lot of what I found synthetic and sort of galling in ""Real Steel"" will work just fine with the target audience."
0,Fresh,...an entertaining afternoon of ramshackle camaraderie.
0,Fresh,"It's really a wonder of nature, a reminder of how we are bound to other species and how valuable and special and downright magical their lives are. It may be a bit corny at times, but it's also downright enlightening."
0,Fresh,"The last act of the film delivers in a shocking way. What comes before it is imperfect, but since we're talking about Nolan here, it's still worth seeing, discussing, and then seeing again."
0,Fresh,"Terry Southern's dialogue occasionally sparkles, and the imaginative designs, as shot by Claude Renoir, look really splendid."
1,Rotten,A complete mess.
0,Fresh,Alfre Woodard [is] absolutely extraordinary here.
1,Rotten,Some of the sketches are inspired... Some of the sketches are merely loud and boring the Pythons are at their unfunniest in drag. Even devout Pythonians might question some of the items.
0,Fresh,"As subtle as an exploding arrow to the head... It almost feels as if this takes everything that First Blood did so well to restrict, and just throws it all at the audience double-fold."
0,Fresh,"Olivier is excellent as the analytical inspector, his easy-going grace a delightful contrast to the two stars."
0,Fresh,Steven Millhauser's short story about a stage magician in turn-of-the-20th-century Vienna has been expanded by writer-director Neil Burger into an overly stately affair that often substitutes production values for imagination.
0,Fresh,"It's cheesy, but what else could be expected from a film with talking animated chipmunks?"
0,Fresh,It's incredibly exciting for a film that's about 90 percent two men talking to each other.
1,Rotten,"Serena is soon to wind up on someone's list of ""worst book-to-movie adaptations."" Count on it."
0,Fresh,"An extremely rare example of a remake being better than its original, even though it lacks the tasty digs at consumerism."
0,Fresh,"One of the most intense and powerful childhood tales, based on Gavino Ledda's memoirs of growing up in Sardinia illiterate and brutalized by his father and how he became a famous writer and master of Greek and Latin."
1,Rotten,"Vaughn, who made the enjoyably tricky gangster movie Layer Cake, gets points for ambition, but this antic fantasy eludes his grasp."
0,Fresh,"Don't misunderstand -- this is no masterpiece akin to Orson Welles' similarly named Citizen, but it's entertaining pulp, cheesy but not campy."
1,Rotten,"Equal parts diverting and strained, most likely to please the same niche audiences who have given the material a modest stage shelf life for the last quarter-century."
1,Rotten,"Stone substitutes bombast for Winslow's wit, and blunts the book's ending to make a cynical but hardly shocking point about government corruption."
0,Fresh,"Oz was no doubt hired to handle the plant monster puppet, but his brisk, lightweight direction spreads satisfyingly across the entire movie."
0,Fresh,"What lingers most is the many shots of people just outside the light beaming in naturally or artificially, longing to get in on what they hold most important."
1,Rotten,"While there are flights of sudden violence, some that discover the twisted psychology of many of the Mafiosos, we learn too much of Buscetta that really only tells us little about him."
0,Fresh,This is gripping nonfiction cinema containing thrills and a point.
0,Fresh,"'You have ugly talents,' George says, almost admiringly, to Martha. So does this movie."
1,Rotten,"For all its sensitivity to the horrors of mental illness, The Soloist ends up as a fairly canned piece of work."
0,Fresh,"Spider-Verse is an instant classic, not for visuals that will, after all, only be singular until the next ground is broken, but for the tremendous care it's taken in finding Miles's heart and then things to fill it, break it, strengthen it."
1,Rotten,"Reign Of Fire should at least be a marvel of special effects, but alas, even the dragon's not very much fun."
0,Fresh,"I had a lot of problems with it, but I still found it entertaining and powerful."
1,Rotten,"Not every horror film with a social message can be Get Out, and they shouldn't be striving to imitate that."
0,Fresh,"This instalment isn't about looking backwards. In essence, it's a war movie and director Gareth Edwards keeps the momentum going with a string of stunning set pieces."
1,Rotten,"If you didn't see and laugh at the first Ted, and maybe also at MacFarlane's button-pushing TV series Family Guy, then another movie deserves your entertainment dollars."
0,Fresh,"Tangerine builds beautifully towards a messy and hilarious climax. Mr. Baker's film is full of wit, but also compassion, and its street-level momentum reminded me of early Truffaut. It's that good."
0,Fresh,Mature fans of truly artistic animation will get more out of the movie than younger audiences.
0,Fresh,"Stands out from the crowd of modern family features, driven by a desire to match its title character's rebellious essence. It is always better to be ambitious and work only some of the time than to never, or rarely, try at all."
0,Fresh,[H]aunting and chilling.
1,Rotten,"As much as the jokes are funny and mostly work, it starts to get in the way of the drama, or at least the emotional heft, that they're trying to go for with what is ultimately this rescue story."
1,Rotten,"These people are responsible for lots of those bad, bland '80s Disney features like The Fox and the Hound. Now, their generic, cheap, animation style has murdered another beautiful E.B. White novel."
0,Fresh,"Besson gives the movie a giddy momentum that propels its hero and heroine through their episodic adventures. Besides, his world building is so prodigal that there is always something flamboyantly entertaining to observe."
0,Fresh,"It's got good acting, and moments of great intensity but Fuqua's overly episodic film feels like three marginally related stories rather than one cohesive tale."
1,Rotten,"On the downside: There is a wackness to The Wackness, a saggy psychic undertow that drags down its lighter and smarter aspects."
0,Fresh,It is as if Judd Apatow were directing Rain Man.
0,Fresh,"For those who get on its wavelength, the rewards are ample and the desire to re-watch will take over."
0,Fresh,"Repo! is definitely out there in the sci-fi stratosphere, like Philip K. Dick on a tab of Timothy Leary's acid ... but if you can dig it, join the GraveRobber and his fiends on the big screen."
1,Rotten,"Nothing pulls you out of a scenario of dread faster than thinking: ""Well, why would that character be filming now? Shouldn't he be helping?"" or ""Well, that falling camera sure landed in a fortuitous position."""
0,Fresh,"The movie is sweetly enjoyable, requiring only the ABCs of simple human identification."
1,Rotten,We'd have to be stoned to be interested in these characters or to be surprised when they form a surrogate family just in time for the blooper reel.
0,Fresh,"A fresh, muscular payback movie shot through with Soderbergh's mischievous indie-spirit."
1,Rotten,While the original kept you awake all night as you left the lights on and spooned your +h Pound Puppy-the sequel induces a sound slumber in seconds.
0,Fresh,"Pawlikowski treats the girls' escalating attraction with delicacy, avoiding the titillating pitfalls of the genre."
0,Fresh,"Tight enough, preposterous enough and slick enough to keep bathroom traffic to a minimum. It is, in other words, the very definition of a good home rental."
0,Fresh,"Eisner stages a tight, confident and relatively big horror film. And farm machinery has rarely been so eerie."
0,Fresh,"St. Agatha is a fine thriller that is much better than you will expect it to be. Bousman guides a coherent and nimble narrative to shocking and satisfying builds. HIs cast is solid, and his crew is on point."

0,Fresh,A love story between a man who gave up on living them and a woman who never even thought she would. [Full review in Portuguese]
0,Fresh,"By minimizing the goofy superhero side of the character, Mangold maximizes the action hero. The Wolverine succeeds when it emphasizes the human in superhuman."
0,Fresh,"Arab-Israeli relations get the warm fuzzy treatment in The Band's Visit, a wonderfully appealing Israeli film that should have been up for a foreign-language Oscar."
0,Fresh,It will likely have moviegoers gathering outside the theater afterward to hash out details of its intricately constructed universe.
0,Fresh,"After several disappointing films (both studio and indies), Gondry is back on terra ferma with this account of youth in the Bronx, which is loose, rambling, and occasionally funny and poignant."
0,Fresh,Kristen Stewart clearly embraces the ability to set aside mopey goth Bella in favor of the more alive but undead Bella.
0,Fresh,"[Adam McKay's] comedic instincts serve him very well here, keeping what could be a very dry subject always feeling wry and engaging, while the facts in turn provide structure and substance."
0,Fresh,"While the end result will feel quite familiar to most viewers, it is both the steely intent and acute sensitivity Vikander isolates in her role that leaves a fresh mark in the memory."
0,Fresh,"[Garner] is ... gloriously in gear, ready to kick some Hand."
0,Fresh,"Shirley is a beautiful, twisted tour de force from a cast and crew operating at the height of their powers. Moss delivers a ferocious, electrifying performance."
0,Fresh,"A brilliant, free flowing depiction of a time, a place and the people who inhabit it."
1,Rotten,"If you're scratching around for something you can bear to sit through with your kids, this is ― to quote another British classic ― mostly harmless. Otherwise, it's one for the gnome buffs."
0,Fresh,"I left this barbed portrait of a cracking-up comic with more than a little respect for its fearless director, Rick Alverson, and his trusting star, Gregg Turkington. You can't deny that they're a match made in heaven."
0,Fresh,"The melodic song and grand Rome setting are more memorable than anything in the plot, characters, or acting; the movie is credited with helping increase American tourism to Italy."
0,Fresh,Get rid of the brash and broody DC and deliver movies like Shazam! more often. This is what superhero movies should be like - very good and unashamedly fun.
1,Rotten,"The sub-Porky's style humour elicits a few guffaws, but a little more wit and subtlety would have helped."
0,Fresh,"Big, loud and lurid, but no less entertaining for that."
0,Fresh,"Socially awkward and overly earnest, Hauser breaks your heart by bringing forth the naivety and blind trust that left Jewell vulnerable to the jackals that surrounded him."
0,Fresh,Pacific Rim isn't bad. It's just that del Toro's attempt to go from a visionary weaver of fantasy to a merchant of summer schlock feels as mechanical as the giant Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.
1,Rotten,"What is missing from this version of Robin Hood is the fun that usually goes with things like robbing the rich and giving the loot to the poor. This comes across as very serious, and it doesn't need to be."

0,Fresh,"Although it's grotesque to see pre-teens stomping in underground warehouse-battle settings, at least Battlefield America's racial politics are interesting."
1,Rotten,"For all the portentous ambience and subtlety of mood in this micro-budget slog through tropical wastelands and the mumbled dialogue of its vacant-eyed protagonists, Monsters wields a pretty heavy-handed allegorical message."
0,Fresh,This film is so slick it's practically frictionless.
0,Fresh,"Even as the film makes Peggy's life appear simple, the complexities she feels become clear in her responses to events that appear, at least at first, quite beyond her control."
1,Rotten,"It's also got that problem of the bad guy, there's never a point when you don't know the bad guy's the bad guy."
0,Fresh,"Writer/director J.J. Anrams' nifty, nostalgic homage to the innocence and wonder epitomized by his mentor/producer Steven Spielberg."

0,Fresh,Superior documentary filmmaking.
0,Fresh,"Yes, it's weird. But it's wild card weird, with that thrill of never knowing what's coming next or when these Parisians are going to get musical on us."
1,Rotten,"... a singularly joyless endeavor, a murky mishmash of skullduggery, ho-hum CG and formulaic cliff-hanger escapes that would have been old hat around the time of 'The Great Train Robbery.'"
1,Rotten,"So far beyond believable, believable would need the Hubble telescope to sneak a peek at it."
1,Rotten,"Branaman's script piles on low-level drama, bad decisions, and enough misdirection to make the film's baffling ending feel not just unearned, but entirely unbelievable."
0,Fresh,"Fully aware of his status as a mini-god to the anti-PC crowd, Gervais clocks up his best stand-up special yet as he rubs against the grain on a wide variety of hot-button topics."
0,Fresh,"Sex, Lies And MasterCard. An irreverent, strictly behind the scenes tabloid peep show about those thankfully unsung guys who perpetrated the online porn revolution, without ever taking their clothes off."
0,Fresh,"Quite a debut here from writer-director Lance Hammer, working on a -cule budget in the Mississippi Delta, and evoking a memorably forlorn kind of regional specificity."
0,Fresh,"In the end, this tale of lonely souls and soulless thugs - of money and morality - even feels kind of hopeful."
0,Fresh,It never quite lives up to its potential. But there's value to be found in its meandering.
1,Rotten,"Chris Cooper is art; the supporting cast is good, but the film is completely bogged down by actual lead Danny Huston."
0,Fresh,A visually rousing epic and a surprisingly effective reworking of a classic.
1,Rotten,"Yet another shallow, dumb blockbuster that could easily be turned into a video game. Matt Damon and Jodie Foster are both underserved by the weak script that favors mind-numbing CGI and action over character development and intelligence."
0,Fresh,One of the most gripping adventure stories put on film this year.
1,Rotten,Solely predicated on its twist ending.
0,Fresh,"February worked my nerves. I found myself actually squirming a bit in my seat, downright uncomfortable by the rising dread that Perkins creates."
0,Fresh,Geek and hero make for a decent enough odd couple; geek and pigeon are often a hoot.
0,Fresh,"Bong Joon-ho's suspenseful, timely thriller that's perhaps one of the best movies of the year."
1,Rotten,"Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton supposedly smolder but actually screech and mock each other, seeming extremely emotionally involved but not in a good way."
0,Fresh,"It delivers what it promises to deliver, and knows that a chase scene is supposed to be about something more than special effects."
1,Rotten,"While that sounds interesting on a theoretical level, the idea of a full-length motion picture cobbled together from this sort of artifact is worrisome, and leaves something to be desired."
0,Fresh,"Those looking for any fault in these stars - or the proud, full-of-life characters they portray - will have to look elsewhere."

0,Fresh,The star power helps the charm outweigh the schmaltz.
0,Fresh,It's the perfect crime picture.
0,Fresh,"Non-narrative films can be opaque in deep ways. Visitors slips into pseudo-profundity. That said, I'd see it again."
1,Rotten,"I felt manipulated. Yeah, I know movies are about manipulation, but having Sally Field caught in traffic and listen to her daughter being raped and murdered is just over the top."
0,Fresh,"The core story hook may be preposterous, but what best resonates in ""The Cobbler"" are its human slice-of-life elements and the big-city, blue-collar milieu in which it is set."
1,Rotten,"Bland pretty boy Speleers is overshadowed by his dragon and human co-stars, with Irons especially impressive despite some very silly dialogue."
1,Rotten,An unfortunate misfire in the movies-about-feasts milieu.

1,Rotten,"Dawdling, dramatically flat and drably-acted thriller"
0,Fresh,"[An] exquisite, lovely film, in which contemporary characters struggle to suspend their disbelief in vampire lore while Jordan's eye for formal beauty and truthful performances suspends ours."
0,Fresh,Good Time is a rousing but shallow bit of grime crime buoyed by Pattinson's performance even as it wallows in cliches.
1,Rotten,"Has a few funny bits, but most of the time, it relies upon sight gags and profanity, neither of which are humorous alone."

1,Rotten,Apart from the presumed financial incentive -- the original did pretty well in theaters and was a big hit on home video -- why was Bad Santa 2 even made in the first place?
0,Fresh,"It's a kind of vampire movie, with our protagonist trapped in the crepuscular purgatory of his early 20s."

0,Fresh,"Director Roger Ross Williams's immensely rewarding documentary tells the story of the Suskind family and shows how love, sensitive parenting and watching tons of kids' movies can save a life."
1,Rotten,Considering how funny it could have been -- either as a faithful big-screen adaptation or as a winking parody -- this sloppy mix of both styles is a disappointment.
0,Fresh,Annihilation maintains a persistent sense of tension that keeps things compelling and will leave you wondering if you need to see it again (or just go read the source material) to make sure you understood what you just saw.

0,Fresh,A lovable old-school musical.
0,Fresh,Excellent film with spectacular visual effects and charming Matt Damon. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,A sweet little film with heart.
0,Fresh,"Although she tends to get actressy in her work, Paltrow's Catherine is a believable portrait of loss and grief."
0,Fresh,"[L]ike watching someone else's half-remembered dreams morphing into a wild cavalcade of lo-fi imagery that makes no sense, but still somehow makes perfect sense."
0,Fresh,"Great band, great music, great film. Not only that, it remains a fascinating portrait of Britain on the cusp of change."
1,Rotten,"""Lockout"" has a very minute amount of cheesy comedy that will have you laughing at it, but maybe that is the point."
0,Fresh,"Streamlining the narrative and adding a bit of welcomed slapstick along the way, Whedon makes Much Ado About Nothing his own. He takes what some might see as tired and dated and finds the modern meaning within."
0,Fresh,"What makes The Piano Teacher bearable is the brave, harrowing performance by Huppert."
1,Rotten,Horror fans will find a great deal of the movie frustratingly familiar.
0,Fresh,"As a gentle comedy, this works in spades and while lesser actors may well have relegated it to made-for-telly cheese, Keaton is, of course, loaded with charisma and comic sense."
0,Fresh,"Rogue One is set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, yet feels more immediate, even prescient, than any Hollywood film in recent memory."
0,Fresh,"An explosion of original artwork, weird characters and thought-provoking action"
0,Fresh,"Rebel Wilson steals the show as Fat Amy, a big, bountiful Bella whose generous physical proportions are matched by her gift of knowing how, when and where to sprinkle on just the right amount of comedic side-dish seasoning."
0,Fresh,"You know you're in an endangered superpower when a vice-president who spells ""potatos"" without an ""e"" is followed two decades later by a president for whom the plural of child is ""childrens""."
1,Rotten,Settles for sitcom setups and punchlines.... feels both slight and generic.
0,Fresh,"If this lovely movie proffers a thesis or a moral, it's a simple one. A more open, fully integrated and passionate life feeds the soul no less than air and water. Or coffee the morning after."
0,Fresh,"An improvement over the dour idiocy of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the silliness of Suicide Squad. Incremental maybe, but still, an improvement."
0,Fresh,Entertainment by Philip Seymour Hoffman both fun and heartbreaking in the enthralling retelling of the American saga that was the end of Truman Capote.
0,Fresh,"Hope, Moore seems to say, is just a word on an old Obama election poster. Something more is required of the American electorate."
0,Fresh,A evoluo de Pryor nos oito anos que separam esta performance de seu primeiro e desastroso show  espantosa: ele no apenas domina o material de maneira inquestionvel como ainda exerce um fascnio absoluto sobre a platia.
0,Fresh,"Just as Moses quarrels with his God, Ridley Scott seems to be in a movie-long battle with his own disbeliefs."
0,Fresh,"The film is an honest celebration of an inventive and daring comedian, whose influence was profound."
1,Rotten,This is indeed an equal opportunity movie. But it's also a movie that beats its one joke into the ground.
0,Fresh,"Stillness can be peaceful, but it can also be menacing."
0,Fresh,"Though not as subtle, complex, or personal as History of Violence, Cronenberg's new film is a grim, taut, well-crafted crimer about the Russian mafia in London, as close to a genre picture as helmer has ever done."
0,Fresh,A masterfully atmospheric film noir.
0,Fresh,"The fans will (designer) label ""Sex and the City"" a hit this weekend."
0,Fresh,"Warm, humorous, and smart, a Huckleberry Finnish snapshot of carefree boyhood on the brink of adolescence."
0,Fresh,You will become numb to the sight of naked men and women... It is as thorough as it gets.
1,Rotten,"Blumhouse Productions releases one of its most forgettable films with The Darkness, a poorly thought out, thoroughly unsurprising horror movie."
1,Rotten,This was the 13th Bond movie and it's possibly the most frivolous in the series to date (it's certainly the most careless).
0,Fresh,This picture will be a major contributor to the award nomination scorecard on both sides of the gender aisle.
0,Fresh,Haunting look at doomed yakuza gangster
1,Rotten,"The more you understand what's really going on, the less you like it."
0,Fresh,"In spite of being almost twenty years old, this monster movie is still harrowing, creepy, and better than modern horror fare."
0,Fresh,"DiCaprio has a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the role... But the absolute winner here is the cinematography, by Inarritu's frequent collaborator, Emmanuel Lubezki."
0,Fresh,How does a first-time filmmaker put together a documentary as compelling and dramatic as this is?
0,Fresh,"Unfolding amid the dappled sunshine and dusty roads of Provence, this is a film that lifts your spirits."
0,Fresh,It's a wonderfully entertaining and beautifully performed film.
0,Fresh,"As an animal lover and environmentalist, this film created an insightful and very unique story that is at once engaging, entertaining and informative."
1,Rotten,Large scale battles and magical pyrotechnics are nice supplements but the absence of well-formed characters and a meaningful narrative render such pretty things moot.
1,Rotten,"The flick is a very plain Jane version of a disaster film with mediocre special effects, no character depth whatsoever and is just a complete waste of money."
1,Rotten,"Loosely based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis, Less Than Zero refuses to take the risks necessary to capture the keen social observation of the book."
0,Fresh,"Sean Penn sings a powerful and poetic hymn to America with ""Into the Wild,"" his sweeping, sensitive and deeply affecting adaptation of Jon Krakauer's best-selling book."
0,Fresh,"In theory it's nothing you haven't seen, but Revenge will make you feel like it is your first time."
0,Fresh,"good, smart, manly entertainment."
0,Fresh,Sometimes you go to a movie and know from the first image that whoever made it knows what she's doing. You don't need convincing. You're there with her. Jennifer Kent's The Babadook is like that.
1,Rotten,"The last time I spent 86 minutes that lasted this long, dental work was involved."
0,Fresh,"The film is ultimately winning because of its devilish anarchic streak, aiming its arrows at the stuffiness of the traditional musical establishment."
0,Fresh,"A smart, nuanced spy thriller that's all about the gray areas."
0,Fresh,"Darren Aronofsky's Mother! is a masterpiece that might make even fans of extreme horror movies wince. It's stylish, complex and superbly acted by Jennifer Lawrence, the titular mother."
1,Rotten,"In emphasizing angst over energy, the movie is much like its hero -- not the dashing crime fighter in a red-and-black bodysuit but the introspective nerd who both endears and exasperates."
0,Fresh,No hyper-designed ersatz futurism for Bekmambetov. Night Watch is knowingly frugal and proudly cruddy.
0,Fresh,"It's been a long time since a movie allowed so many diverse narratives to fold into so unexpected, unified and satisfying a story."
0,Fresh,"It's funny and gripping, a story about people that also happens to be about journalistic principle."
0,Fresh,"A very good film, with two hours of extraordinary, gripping filmmaking and twenty final minutes of subtle deflation."
1,Rotten,Clint Eastwood makes his infamous chair speech look like chapter one of a season of self-parody.
0,Fresh,"The costumes delight, the period evocation in the scenery and photography is rich and pleasing, and the cutting keeps the pace racing forward."
1,Rotten,"Despite some great performances and clever moments, the film never reaches expectations. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,These characters really are like old friends -- there's something almost comforting about going back and hanging out with them again.
0,Fresh,"Shakespeare's Scottish play returns to the big screen with earthy energy, visual style and roaring performances."
0,Fresh,"Daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that, by the time the credits roll across the pat ending, a warm, fuzzy feeling prevails."
0,Fresh,It's a fascinating film that reveals much about its characters and provides food for thought for all of us who live in a capitalist society. Greed may be good for the avaricious but it's sure as hell ugly when it comes at any cost
1,Rotten,"Better than the first, but not by much."
0,Fresh,"The movie is one to savor for its good humor and big heart, despite some hackneyed fairy-tale notions."
0,Fresh,Rare is the terrible film that's this upbeat and delightful and entertaining.
1,Rotten,"A stew of totally predictable plot turns, misfired teen phrase-making ... and a tongue-in-cheek glorification of a mindless vulgarity."
0,Fresh,"Bigger action, more amazing deserted (and devastated) London sequences and biting contemporary relevance, if a touch less heart than the original."
0,Fresh,"Raimi likes to put offbeat actors instead of big stars in key roles, and it pays dividends again."
0,Fresh,Yorgos Lanthimos has once again shown he's a master at metaphorical drama as he explores the abstract moral distinction between guilt and responsibility.
1,Rotten,You have a tangled story being told by director Nick Ryan and writer Mark Monroe in a somewhat tangled way. The result isn't as much confusing as it is distracting.
0,Fresh,"A finely tuned comedy machine, a film that not only works as a standalone contemporary project, but one that will come to be viewed in five, 10, 15 years as a snapshot of industry players at their prime, and a handy guide to before-they-were-famous icons."
0,Fresh,"''Prince of Darkness'' is a real tour de force, and a welcome return."
0,Fresh,George Clooney at his best
0,Fresh,"Everything Must Go sounds touchy-feely but writer-director Dan Rush sets a darkly serious tone that seldom wavers. Ferrell gives himself over to the vibe, creating a character both pitiful and redeemable with the subtlest acting choices."
1,Rotten,Profane shoot-'em-up cops-and-robbers flick is very pro-gun.
0,Fresh,"As comedies go, it's as dry as bleached bones in the desert, but you can't blame Vigalondo for taking another shot at cleverness."
1,Rotten,"As biography and black comedy, Quills comes up short."
0,Fresh,"With its disquieting finale and clear-eyed appraisal of human failing and weakness, Inside Llewyn Davis feels much more like their genuine follow-up to A Serious Man."
1,Rotten,"In case you miss the joke, McBride helpfully arcs an eyebrow and cocks his head to signal the punchline. And with all the subtlety of Thor, he hammers most of his crude one-liners in the direction of Portman as the vengeful warrior chick Isabel."
0,Fresh,There is no denying Kim's ability to drag the viewer into those dark places of humanity that we don't want to go. It's not an easy film but it's a worthwhile one.
1,Rotten,"The film does occasionally show a pulse when it tries to re-imagine the life of the victim - when it turns the tables on the mystery and tries to become a film about love and life, instead of doom and death. But it's too little, too late, and too lame."
0,Fresh,"Those who don't know what the autistic spectrum is, may have a biased but self-explanatory view. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,The finest film Danny Boyle has made...time to throw an Oscar at James Franco.
1,Rotten,"Incompetently made and covered in corn, this is a martial arts movie that makes you yearn for The Karate Kid. Yes, that movie was corny, as well, but at least it was fun. Redbelt isn't fun, just laughable."
1,Rotten,"This is a sword-and-sorcery adventure for those who like their action fast and furious, their dialogue ropey and their acting filled with more ham than a butcher's shop."
0,Fresh,Originally told and surprisingly funny.
1,Rotten,Routine romantic thriller lacks acting and directing flair.
0,Fresh,"The cat & mouse premise may be somewhat familiar, but the presentation is top-notch. Scary, suspenseful, and altogether compelling."
0,Fresh,"While it's lavish and lush in all the expected costume-drama ways, A Royal Affair never bogs down in period detail."
0,Fresh,"The film is messy at first but pitch-perfect in its second half, featuring a story demanding to be told with moving performances by a stellar cast."
1,Rotten,"I'm sure the pot-laced antics of these trashy dudes are, like, totally hilarious on Canadian TV, but they don't translate well to America or the big screen."
0,Fresh,"Three cheers for a feisty, break-all-the-rules heroine who is a bold innovator in the grueling world of competitive gymnastics."
0,Fresh,[A] poignant and involving comedy drama.
0,Fresh,"Talk, mood and feel dominate as action fades into the background. The air is filled with the sting of smoke, buttressed by the heavy smell of a dark brew."
0,Fresh,The defibrillator to the heart has worked wonders.
1,Rotten,"An action drama/weepie that's so busy telling us that its characters are heroes, it forgets that they should be people first."
0,Fresh,"It's just gunfights strung together, without a whisper of coherence or meaning."
1,Rotten,Catherine Keener rarely gets the chance to grab the spotlight all for herself. That makes this turgid drama especially disappointing.
0,Fresh,"Yes, ""Hunger"" is a fairly nasty affair and we don't even get to the starvation part until the third act."
0,Fresh,"A vividly humanist, anti-war classic."
0,Fresh,"Even though Prize Winner ultimately asks us to swallow that golfball-size happy pill, Anderson and her not-so-secret weapon Moore are actually clawing their way toward something deeper and far more complex than a cheerful, embroidered slogan."
0,Fresh,A damning documentary which exposes FEMA's wholesale failings while depicting a nation still deep in denial and willing to look the other way despite the ongoing suffering of a long-marginalized segment of society.
0,Fresh,"Ad Astra is a kind of movie you rarely see anymore, using blockbuster assets to tell an arthouse story, but it's a superb original blend that we need more of in our increasingly homogenous film landscape."
0,Fresh,Breathe offers ample evidence of the growing confidence and skill of Melanie Laurent as a director.
0,Fresh,"As it is, this one is compelling enough, a potent mix of outrage, residual anger, and sorrow that speaks not just to the legacy of our misadventures in Vietnam, but to the entire uncertain future of a nation at war."
0,Fresh,Green's Halloween isn't a derivative sequel. The new film also brilliantly and earnestly adopts the visual language of Carpenter's creation
0,Fresh,"Sandler is fascinating to watch in this role as the shady wheeler dealer Howard Ratner. He whipsaws from manic emotional highs, tenderness and mischief to devastating lows. Watching Ratner desperately juggle bets and deals is something to behold."
1,Rotten,"Difícil compreender como o roteiro pedestre de Beaufoy, a direção comprometida de Boyle e o próprio filme arrebanharam tantos troféus e placas nos últimos meses."
1,Rotten,Few use the backdrop of gender inequality more awkwardly.
1,Rotten,Doesn't even qualify as effectively executed propaganda.
1,Rotten,A hostage thriller with barely any tension. A recession-era cri de cur without much fervor. A star vehicle that thumbs its nose at the common man it purports to represent.
1,Rotten,"It's possible to imagine a tense, thought-provoking version of this story, but Arnby opts for atmospherics over ideas."
0,Fresh,"The temptation to call Debra Granik's latest film, Frozen River Jr., will be great. But the longer the buzz builds for it and for Jennifer Lawrence's star-making performance, it will become abundantly clear that this is the Senior of the two films."
0,Fresh,"The film is a ferocious coming-of-age tale beginning with the arrival of 19-year-old Malik El Djebena (French-Algerian Tahar Rahim, who recalls the beautiful ruffians of Caravaggio) in a hard-core French prison."
0,Fresh,"Very good, very disturbing documentary by director Gabriela Cowperthwaite about killer whales in captivity and the dangers they present to their trainers...The film contains some pretty vivid footage."
0,Fresh,A bit toothless -- it's difficult to cut too deeply when your satirical take on studio blockbusters and crazy actors is produced by a major studio with Tom Cruise in a supporting role -- but offers a number of genuine laughs between the self-congratulator
1,Rotten,A slick technical packaging by director Antoine Fuqua can't offset the lumbering plotting and patchwork quality of producer-star Gerard Butler's vehicle.
1,Rotten,"As dazzling as Ocean's 8's lineup is, this spinoff isn't as enjoyable as it ought to be."
1,Rotten,"Three people in the audience danced at the finale, too, male and female, so it couldn't have sucked. Pay a buck, take a load off, sip a soda, and enjoy it for what it is."
1,Rotten,"A hornet's nest of irrational behavior, wrapped up snugly in a smug, shallow, and diseased feature film that does a masterful job brainlessly wiggling around for an interminable amount of screentime."
1,Rotten,"A dreary horror thriller, without any of those pesky thrills."
0,Fresh,A powerful documentary that offers both a chilling expose of the toxins in our food that are causing so much disease and an affirmation of a plant-oriented therapy that has cured cancer in many individuals.
1,Rotten,I just saved you a lot of aggravation. You owe me.
1,Rotten,"Mindless, metallic mayhem..."
1,Rotten,Feels engineered the way women's magazines too often do: to deliver the feel-good without burdening us with too much feeling or thought.
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the movie's didacticism returns in the lengthy and somewhat tedious courtroom ending dealing with the aftermath of the Series."
0,Fresh,"Little had big laughs, a little star with big presence, an important lesson mixed with a little dab of warmth and heart. What Little lacks in story telling, heart tugging & depth is compensated for in the command Marsai Martin has over this film. Funny!"
0,Fresh,The Promise is a heartfelt film with noble ambitions
1,Rotten,"The sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups, stunts, and sexy encounters of the previous 18 Bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original."
0,Fresh,"A film of almost humiliating perfection, since it's precisely about that, of humiliation. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,...there's ultimately very little here to appeal to even the most die-hard Cook fanatic.
0,Fresh,The re-teaming of Greengrass and Matt Damon once again produces a gem.
0,Fresh,"As mythic spectacles go, it beats Clash Of The Titans, particularly in the areas of intimidating villainy and actual Titan-clashing."
0,Fresh,There's enthusiasm and energy here that balances out the more blatant weirdness and absurdity.
1,Rotten,"Near the end of the story, Michael Keaton utters what could come to be regarded as the direst threat in movie history: 'From now on, it's Malby time.'"
0,Fresh,It's unfortunate that the shrewdness -- dare I say thought? -- that went into shaping Brosnan's aging hero doesn't extend to the rest of the movie.
0,Fresh,"Dustin Hoffman charms in [this] colorful fairy tale, but despite plenty of magical moments, it's missing the extra sparkle that could make it a classic."
1,Rotten,Goes down like a rock--only slowly.
0,Fresh,"An absorbing, sensitive drama that feels painfully, and often amusingly, true."
1,Rotten,"The appeal, perhaps, will be strongest to the young."
1,Rotten,"Batman was no longer torn from the pages of a funny book, but peeled off the bottom of a pair of Dr. Martens."
0,Fresh,There are moments in The Fellowship of the Ring that I have only seen in my most winsome and wildest fantasies.
1,Rotten,"Doesn't amount to much with Josh Brolin, but it would be a lot less fun without him."
0,Fresh,"Tries to be ""The Big Lebowski"" of the War on Terror."
1,Rotten,"There are other things that Meet Dave is better than... like famine, disease and genocide... but not by much."
0,Fresh,Johnny Depp's beauty and talent salvage this rigorously stagy film on the life and bad-boy times of the second Earl of Rochester.
0,Fresh,"Most appealing is the film's mixture of California post-War history, cults and a tinge of science fiction - an intriguing combination of elements that make it a winner."
1,Rotten,"Excellent Cadavers uses archival footage to place the war in the context of the longtime alliance between the Mafia and crooked Italian politicians, but there's little, if anything, that will be new for those interested in the subject."
0,Fresh,"The comparisons to Fellini have been plentiful, but The Great Beauty is very much its own thing."
0,Fresh,"Almost relentlessly energetic and loony, bursting with random sight gags and subtle, whip-smart comedy."
0,Fresh,The film hooks you from first shot onwards and refuses to let go. The suspense is maintained throughout. There are enough red herrings to keep a convention of Agatha Christie fans happy.
1,Rotten,"While Nick comes to appreciate women in all their complexity and depth, the movie is only interested in them as props and tools to aid in his eventual enlightenment."
0,Fresh,"The movie is not your routine shoot-'em-up action adventure but an intricate weaving of people, conventions, and personal relationships."
0,Fresh,"Amy Adams impeccable from beginning to end, and her cheerful moxie is proving to be a valuable commodity in film after film, partly because it's deceptive. But there's a better film somewhere inside this story."
0,Fresh,"Although it sometimes feels like a one-note joke stretched out too long, it's still probably the most unique comedy you'll see all year."
0,Fresh,"An original film, outstanding, a success. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,It's a welcome respite from many of today's filmmakers who think their films aren't complete without a gazillion quick edits or other visual shenanigans that often cover up storytelling shortcomings. (Parental Review also available)
0,Fresh,"Engaging and enjoyable documentary enlivened by a likeable central duo and a wealth of superb archive footage, though there's actually very little substance to the story outside of the basic synopsis."
0,Fresh,"'The Bounty Hunter' is a fast-paced, action-packed romantic comedy. I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed it, especially after seeing those underwhelming previews."
0,Fresh,This movie is a really real story; it's very relatable for a lot of people.
1,Rotten,"[Will] Smith's kinetic charm goes a long way to making us forgive some of those shortcomings, particularly if you grew up on the '90s action films that helped make him a global star. But a movie with this type of artistic pedigree deserves more."
0,Fresh,"A little more attention to fact checking would have given the other scientific assertions in ""More Than Honey"" added weight, but even so this remains a fascinating, sometimes visually stunning, call to action."
0,Fresh,...a calm and straightforward documentary [that] looks at the lives of three gay men in their sunset years.
0,Fresh,Dorothy Dandridge became the very first black woman to receive Best Actress Oscar nomination for Otto Preimger's audacious (for the early 1950s) all-black musical of the famous opera.
0,Fresh,It's another case of independent film artists beating Hollywood at its own game.
1,Rotten,"It's a derivative, cliché awful film..."
0,Fresh,"Director Barry Sonnenfeld loads the bases with action, fantasy and laughs, and hits a grand slam."
0,Fresh,A strong horror mystery that skirts the edge of torture porn but never quite resorts to such exploitative violence...
1,Rotten,"There's something sad about Lee purposely sculpting her breasts to resemble basketballs, then parading around topless or nearly topless for most of the film, while her character is supposed to comically strike a blow for feminism."
1,Rotten,The pigeonholed characters constrict Chestnut and the usually good Henson from portraying fully developed adults; the same dilemma hits most of the supporting cast.
1,Rotten,"Carell could have given the performance of his life (he doesn't), and the film would have remained a clich-ridden mess with a narrative built on convenience and coincidence."
0,Fresh,"A fully realized, rich, atmospheric drama that may be the most textured film I've ever seen shot on DV."
1,Rotten,Willis looks tired.
1,Rotten,[A] well-intentioned but clumsy attempt to get into the head of one of the 20th century's most famous women ...
0,Fresh,"It's suspenseful and heartbreaking, and doesn't provide easy answers."
0,Fresh,"Best to see them as individual films with nothing in common apart from source material, one a classic, the other a strong enough picaresque amongst some decent fabulation."
1,Rotten,"There's visual overstatement, stone-heavy exposition, self-seriousness (masquerading as maturity), CGI-laden plot (falling short of spectacle), and predictable action sequences."
0,Fresh,"Coppola's poor-rich-girl vision is certainly consistent, although you sometimes wonder if she knows that hers is not the universal human condition."
0,Fresh,"It takes a confident, accomplished filmmaker to make a war film like this, epic, understated, nearly bereft of dialog, no off screen narration, a huge story brought down to intimate levels. It reminds me of some Stanley Kubrick movies."
0,Fresh,"Albert gets offered the opportunity to redeem her actions, and make light of why and how she conned the world. Unsurprisingly, she's a hell of a storyteller."
0,Fresh,"Only half as dumb as it kids on, Safe is still a cut above the average actioner."
0,Fresh,"It is a stirring, heart-wrenching look at the atrocities of war and ""Death"", as witnessed by a fiercely determined young girl."
0,Fresh,"With what feels like an abrupt ending after 90 minutes, Black Christmas's loaded material doesn't leave more than a superficial mark. But its gung-ho heroines bring an entertaining, if disposable, diversion with holiday trimmings."
0,Fresh,"A stirring, affectionately felt biopic about a necessary milestone in sports history. The not-so-secret weapon of ""Battle of the Sexes"" is Billie Jean King herself, and Emma Stone's impassioned turn playing her."
0,Fresh,"You couldn't write characters this vibrant, hilarious, sinister, or eccentric, and if you tried, people would accuse you of resorting to stereotypes."
1,Rotten,"This is a gruesome film, even by modern standards. It is also utterly devoid of a point, or interesting ideas."
0,Fresh,"...if `Inside Man' benefits more from Lee than he does from it, at least moviegoers come out ahead in the bargain."
0,Fresh,A fitting capstone on a collection of screen classics for the ages!
0,Fresh,"...perhaps the best argument for Clint Eastwood as a savvier, craftier and more complicated filmmaker than the one many consider him to be."
1,Rotten,"Few things are as intolerable as schlock that takes itself seriously. Diary of the Dead, the latest zombie epic from George Romero, falls into that trap."
1,Rotten,Black Butterfly would've be a modest but effective thriller had its creative team not attempted to get too clever.
0,Fresh,"It's a more impishly entertaining Moore than usual, using comedy and even a bit of fantasy to prove his point."
0,Fresh,"2001: A Space Odyssey shows violence, deception, and hubris as built inside our DNA with permanence fated to fuel our demise."
0,Fresh,One of the most complex and demanding animated films to date.
1,Rotten,Jules Verne would appreciate all the flourishes of... Industrial Revolution gingerbread... But no amount of cool visuals can make up for the thin plot and weak characters.
0,Fresh,It's nice to see he relied on more than heavy-handed filmmaking and a twist ending. I just hope audiences go for a supernatural thriller that's a little messier and doesn't feel the need to claw at their heart for two hours.
0,Fresh,"In A History of Violence, director David Cronenberg's delirious wow of a movie about violence and sex and the American dream, cinema regains all its original power to shock and surprise."
1,Rotten,"As a nail-biting thriller of court intrigue, lies, and rebellion, I would be forced to admit that, yes, Lisy Christl's costume designs are really pretty good. I'm drawing a blank on anything else."
1,Rotten,"In spite of the teasing promise of its title, Mike Nichols's deft drama does everything it can to push you away."
0,Fresh,"Isn't so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids -- kids of all ages."
0,Fresh,"In Cave of Forgotten Dreams, he seems to return for the first time with an actual chunk of the destination, carved out to be shared generously with the rest of the world."
1,Rotten,It's the marriage of Hollywood's least attractive couple -- parsimony and greed.
0,Fresh,"The decency of the first film was undercut by the second film's inadequacy. This film, however, builds upon the best elements of the series, providing perhaps the most heartfelt of the trilogy."
1,Rotten,It whips from tense to flat-out ridiculous and leaves you feeling dumb for having once cared about it.
0,Fresh,It's a chronicle of blue-collar workers who depend on each other for emotional sustenance. A deep sadness lurks under the laughs. It seeps under your skin.
1,Rotten,"Bouchareb fails to turn his outsider's point of view into new insights, and instead takes the easy route, falling back on familiar stereotypes in his tour of US misogyny and xenophobia."
1,Rotten,"Don't believe the hype. A far more intriguing, follow the money power struggle off screen instead, pitting corporate interests against the mass popular discontent of the downwardly mobile US population in progress. In other words, who funded your movie."
0,Fresh,"Director Seijun Suzuki outdid himself with this astonishing blend of yakuza movie, film noir and nouvelle vague."
0,Fresh,"By the time Etheredge-Ouzts uncorks the Suspiria-meets-Un Chant d'Amour climax, the film has snowballed enough subtext for five Robin Wood dissertations"
0,Fresh,"It's the one closest in spirit to Capote himself, the fabulist whose very conception of In Cold Blood as a 'nonfiction novel' stemmed from the wisdom that reality is rarely as tantalizing as fantasy."
1,Rotten,"If All I See Is You had worked as a thriller, then maybe I wouldn't still be thinking about why Blake Lively put a dead bird in the freezer."
0,Fresh,"Paltrow stars as a woman who may or may not be around the twist. Having named her real-life child after a piece of fruit, that's what I call inspired casting."
0,Fresh,"To describe the opening scenes makes them seem routine, and yet they captured my attention with an intensity that I still do not understand."
0,Fresh,"...it misses the mark on the duality-Saroo goes from forgetting his past completely to suddenly being all about it, and it's a lot more complicated than that"
1,Rotten,"There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about, but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust."
0,Fresh,Little Joe is a gripping and visually striking satire of essentialist maternal instinct and the contemporary anxiety of wellbeing.
0,Fresh,"There are a few clichés which can be seen coming for miles, but Miseducation is otherwise chilling."
0,Fresh,"Murphy creates a rather fascinating chemistry with Fanning, who resolutely absconds with the film as a controlling tot from hell, a fun-killing spinster trapped in a prepubescent body."
1,Rotten,"Despite a few inspired moments, and the presence of Peter Dinklage, this is your typical Sandler film that his Happy Madison production company has churned out the last 15 years or so."
0,Fresh,"Though the horror genre is sated with maniacs on the menace, Fear No Evil stands out. Spooky and surreal, the ultimately hopeful film has its basis in religious morality."
1,Rotten,"...a fairly disastrous misfire that simply doesn't work in any way, shape, or form (and this is to say nothing of McAdams' consistently distracting accent)."
1,Rotten,"It's a noble effort, but ""The Public"" never makes a convincing case for its cause."
0,Fresh,A believably unbalanced Bening scores the movie's true coup: Karen's revitalizing relationship with a sweetly persistent coworker (Jimmy Smits) is a rare example of Hollywood doing right by midlife romance.
1,Rotten,"The plot's a total shambles. The message (rob, pillage and snort your way to a no-consequences happy ending) stinks."

1,Rotten,... The movie is mostly a snoozer with Bella and Edward spending a lot of time merely exchanging glances or staring longingly at each other.
1,Rotten,"[Penelope is] a badass, she's headstrong, she's self-assured, and she's dryly funny, but her own movie is so dry that the structure cracks under its own pressure."

1,Rotten,"If Christmas means spending it with the irascible, over-the-top Kranks, then taking a Caribbean cruise really does sound like a much better deal."
1,Rotten,"Given the pedigree of the cast... it's such a shame that The Conspirator is, for the most part, a run-of-the-mill courtroom drama."
0,Fresh,"Faith is what Ushpizin is all about and, between the fine writing, direction and view into what is, to most of us, a foreign world..., is the heart of the film."

0,Fresh,"Although no one actually says 'This town ain't big enough for the both of us,' or 'Take me to your leader' Cowboys & Aliens does indeed incorporate many of its mash-up movie roots and it does so well."
0,Fresh,"It's a humane and witty treatment of an average life that, incidentally, speaks to the worth and inherent drama of average lives."
1,Rotten,"It's a theme park ride but not the rollercoaster Spielberg hopes. More like It's a Small Virtual World, careening through gamer nirvana, jerking viewers to and fro among everything Gen X retro."
1,Rotten,"At one point, Bumblebee essentially urinates on an annoying federal officer. It's hard to believe Bay or Spielberg think this is funny... This is pandering at its worst, and it reveals a lack of respect for the audience, kids and adults alike."
1,Rotten,"An eerily atmospheric first two acts that David Lynch would certainly enjoy, but the film chokes on the final act, resulting in a forgettable movie that could and should have devoured the horror genre whole."
0,Fresh,"It summons a shrug more than it does astonishment, but at least it looks good on the way."
0,Fresh,"The arc of the Howes' careers looks so much like the autopsies of similar 1970s rock bands that you brace yourself for the inevitable tragic end. And yet, even with the details of their demise more implied than stated, it still stings like real life."

1,Rotten,"In the end, the door is left open for a Taken 3, although you do rather wish the Mills family would just throw away their passports."
1,Rotten,"The movie may well appeal to Mormon audiences because the plot directly incorporates the tenets of their religion. They may also pick up on thematic cues not apparent to non-Mormons. All other audiences will see it as a generic, unconvincing thriller."

1,Rotten,The flimsiness of the film's foundations and the disorder of its episodes provoke the inevitable impression that it all fell together en route.
0,Fresh,"It's a funny movie, but not an uproarious one. It's not overstated or understated, but clearly and honestly stated, and anchored by strong performances from its young cast."
0,Fresh,a cool flick from the master of grotesque
0,Fresh,This 1967 thriller draws its effectiveness less from the intelligence of the direction (by Terence Young) than from the unbridled sadism of the concept.

1,Rotten,"Horrible Bosses 2's affected zaniness/stupidity makes it exhausting and ultimately, a mite tedious."
0,Fresh,"It provides a resolution for all the toys, which though predicated on the same idea as previous films, namely each toy finding their purpose, gives that theme expression in a way that feels more individuated to the characters and satisfying."

0,Fresh,"Enchantingly earnest, perhaps the best live-action, family film of the summer...."
0,Fresh,"I think ""Super"" is occasionally brilliant, sometimes awful and terribly confusing overall; this movie reminds me of an old Irish joke about the ancient and terrifying housekeeper who asks the young priest whether he enjoyed his egg."

0,Fresh,"Leslie, My Name is Evil is Reginald Harkema's next step in socially conscious filmmaking."
1,Rotten,"Neither a dud nor a cinematic page-turner, the movie ultimately proves too mild and ordinary to satisfy beyond the level of a passable rainy-day matinee."
0,Fresh,"Immensely satisfying, and if it's also puzzling and frustrating at times, so is life."
0,Fresh,"Refuses to take anything too seriously, staking out a middle ground between melodrama and farce."
1,Rotten,"Sarah Michelle Gellar may have ditched the Grudge franchise, but her predilection for illogical horror continues with The Return."
1,Rotten,"It has a sort of soapy reliability, but compare it to the blazing passion of Baz Luhrmann's modern-day version with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in gangland LA and it looks pretty feeble."
1,Rotten,"It's so bad that even the kids, who (let's face it) aren't a very discriminating audience, were hooting at it during an opening-day screening."
1,Rotten,Chris Rock shines in Julie Delpy's latest light and loose creation. But it's not on the same wonderful level as her Paris predecessor.
1,Rotten,more of an endurance test than a pleasure cruise. ... Every time they turn up... Chenoweth and Daniels give this sluggish sitcom a revitalizing shot of adrenaline.
1,Rotten,"Interview, a mood swing of a film with a trap-door resolution, is never much more than an elliptical exercise in symbiotic insincerity."
0,Fresh,"Beautifully made, courageously edited, and swift-moving, this challenging, provocative film is a work that is both humanist and revolutionary."
0,Fresh,Revealing moments and Ms. Kassell's solid direction redeem the film's perfunctory script and deliver a film that will make you shiver and also make you think. This one will stay with you.
1,Rotten,Bah humbug!
1,Rotten,"What Keeps You Alive squanders its casting with a formulaic story, predictable twists, and a screenplay so hackneyed you can guess lines before they're said."
0,Fresh,"While director Sam Raimi's surefooted adaptation doesn't quite reach the upper echelon of superhero flicks, it mostly gets everything right."
1,Rotten,"Unremittingly over-the-top and brutal, All About the Benjamins is as cunning as it is crude."
0,Fresh,It's the laugh-a-minute repartee of this odd couple that drives the movie far more than the ridiculously overly complicated plot.
1,Rotten,"We never quite know what Willie Stark does stand for, aside from the fact that we're repeatedly told he's a man of the people. Penn's performance has the opacity of solid brick."
1,Rotten,"Perhaps what this version demonstrates is that Flaubert's text can make for a perfectly cinematic effort, but continues to attract the unfilmable label when features miss the spark so crucial to its story."
0,Fresh,"The event of the summer? Maybe. After a hideous May and June, unadulterated competence feels like an event."
1,Rotten,"The art world is fair game for satire; frankly, this is a world ripe for mean comedy. But Velvet Buzzsaw never lands the joke-instead, it falls prey to becoming one."
0,Fresh,"Is Nebraska a comedy or a drama? Like life, it's both. Payne takes his time. Deal with it. This is a movie to bring home and live with, to kick around in your head after it hits you in the heart. It's damn near perfect, starting with the acting."
1,Rotten,"A resonant journalistic cautionary tale gets packaged as a hokey thriller in Kill the Messenger, a movie with a message that isn't nearly as urgent as it needs to be."
0,Fresh,"Lends itself to the narcotizing bland (sinister, though not nearly so sinister as the biennial Disney girl movie) machinations of the biennial Disney boy movie."
0,Fresh,"Thankfully, ""What She Said"" is balanced on the subject of Kael's clout in the film and magazine industries, which could be as bruising as it was influential."
1,Rotten,The characters are one-dimensional. The narrative is flat and obvious.
1,Rotten,"""Interstellar"" is a grand undertaking, but in shooting for the stars, it loses its footing. It goes to infinity and beyond, when infinity would have been plenty."
0,Fresh,"The vibrant animated feature ""The Book of Life"" is a cheeky celebration of Mexican folklore with a solid cast, an irreverent sensibility and gorgeous visuals."
0,Fresh,All of those on either side of the greed equation will admire director/writer J.C. Chandor's taut tale of Wall Street brokers at their worst.
0,Fresh,"Kung Fu Panda is yet another celebrity-voiced animal adventure, but it stands out from the crowd of similar films with its lightning wit and whirlwind brio."
0,Fresh,"It's a horror movie you need to watch through splayed fingers, not because of anything frightening on screen, but because of its awkwardness."
0,Fresh,"Delivers thrilling action, witty dialogue and genuine emotion, thanks to a cleverly crafted script, state-of-the-art special effects, strong, likeable characters and note-perfect performances."
1,Rotten,"The perfect follow-up to ""Jackass"" if only because it's equally moronic, although in this case, it's not even remotely funny."
1,Rotten,Even without the bad timing %u2013 a paean to debt and excess released a few months after the world's biggest financial meltdown since the 1920s %u2013 it still would not have worked.

0,Fresh,"Great but extremely brutal, vicious revenge story."
1,Rotten,"The last time Murphy played a nightclub owner, we got Harlem Nights, which was actually better."
1,Rotten,"The preachiness - about ""faith"" - gets so thick that the film completely loses all its early zingy lightness of touch."
1,Rotten,..riddled with continuity errors...stupid victim behavior cliches...and inconsistencies...begins with its heroine's 911 call but has no viable way of incorporating that call into its own unfolding logic.
1,Rotten,"McCarthy is still a tremendously appealing presence, but her script about a gal who tries to move on after her himbo boyfriend kicks her to the curb is pure amateur hour."
1,Rotten,Director Steve Carr continues his streak of numbingly mediocre family comedies.
0,Fresh,"Wild sass, gentle comedy, shivs of poignancy, and instantly vivid characters add up to a wonderful riff on mob movies as a Chinatown granny faces off against gangsters. Tsai Chin is an absolute hoot."
0,Fresh,Get the hell down to the cinema pronto.
0,Fresh,"Despite dragging in the last third, the movie works as a light and frothy confection for an enjoyable Valentine's Day treat."
0,Fresh,"Shadyak plays things straight, with no show-offy visual flourishes, slowly building a full head of indignation and then letting all that pressure out with a whoosh of relief. Best of all, he gets really strong performances out of his players."
1,Rotten,This is a comedy with only one genuinely funny scene.
1,Rotten,It's the next bold entry in the genre of Hilariously Terrible Nicolas Cage Movies.
0,Fresh,A giddying gender dynamics-flipping tale that goes right to the heart of ensconced power equations that rest squarely on the privileges and entitlements that money can buy.
0,Fresh,[The movie] twists an awkward encounter with an old high-school acquaintance into a cracking psychological thriller that offers some genuine surprises.
0,Fresh,A splendid movie because of the quality and strength of its images as well as the tone of the story. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Die Hard on a ship, this Steven Seagal starrer is a hard-charged, perfectly detonated actioner that should especially delight especially macho mainstreamers."
1,Rotten,This film is a cinematic hate crime.
1,Rotten,"There's been talk of World Trade Center bringing people to tears. After seeing the film, it's hard to believe that they're not tears of boredom."
0,Fresh,The 3D is moderately imaginative...
1,Rotten,A tortured talkfest with a premise far less ripe than its title.
1,Rotten,"This over-extended teen dystopia is treading water, coming up short on its trademark punchy plotting, teen self-discovery and the wonderful Woodley."

0,Fresh,"Newcomer Manyaka, who as Chanda carries the family's burdens on her slender shoulders, is compelling -- she always seems to be leaning forward, ready to walk head first into her next battle."
0,Fresh,"Super 8 is a bit of a frustrating movie. It's well-paced, emotional, and captures a certain innocence of pre-pubescent youth, without becoming too cheesy."
0,Fresh,Visually it's a thrilling buffet full of endless references to other films as well. You can just sit back and drink in what's on screen
0,Fresh,"Max Reload And The Nether Blasters is terrific fun. The acting is great, the action is fun, the dialogue humorous, and the plot original."
1,Rotten,"More inanimate than haunting, The Little Stranger is Abrahamson's least interesting feature."
0,Fresh,"while it might be tempting to dismiss Herschell Gordon Lewis' low-budget, utterly tawdry smorgasbord of sensationalism as dumb-assed trash, it is too self-aware to merit such dismissal. Hell, it even ends in a literal trash yard..."
0,Fresh,An intense drama of mental meltdown and domestic apocalypse for an age of anxiety.
0,Fresh,An especially pointed variation on one of music's most oft-told tales: A band formed ahead of its time sits in muffled obscurity while others reap the harvest of what it first planted.
0,Fresh,"What this well-intentioned film lacks in poise and polish, it makes up for in what faith-based audiences so hungrily seek: a passionate and compassionate interpretation for family viewing that portrays the Christ story with reverence."
0,Fresh,"An energetic, irreverent, autobiographically inspired affair filled with key swapping, children running amok and a rotting 200-tonne whale, the film proves a mixed bag but, given the era on display, its messiness always feels appropriate."
1,Rotten,Talent abounds but the movie can't balance the comedy and drama.
0,Fresh,"Scrat's eternal and Sisyphean struggle both to acquire and to retain the acorn he's been chasing has, in equal parts, both hilarity and a keen commentary on the noble struggle of humankind against a basically unfeeling universe"
0,Fresh,Children of Men succeeds as a downbeat dystopian thriller with some intriguing themes.
0,Fresh,A very funny heist film.
0,Fresh,"This is a woman who has been through hell and come out kicking, and the result is as much a celebration as it is a documentary"
0,Fresh,"More thematically dense and ambitious than any crime film you'll see this year and with an incredible ensemble, The Place Beyond the Pines is the kind of daring, adult drama that critics bemoan doesn't get made nearly enough."
0,Fresh,Kumiko the Treasure Hunter is a real find... an oddly funny and often heartbreaking portrait of mental illness as well as exploration of both the freeing power and danger of cinephilia.
1,Rotten,"No one's asking for a somber account of simian life, but perhaps Buzz Lightyear could keep quiet for a bit and let the monkey business speak for itself."
1,Rotten,Utterly bonkers.
1,Rotten,One thing is for certain: Girls Trip should make a star of Tiffany Haddish...
0,Fresh,"Mike Leigh's latest... is almost about nothing at all, and yet it gently juxtaposes the big issues of everyday life: loneliness and love, selfishness and kindness, birth and death."
1,Rotten,"When the movie was over, I remember saying, 'Well, that wasn't terrible.' (I'm sure Screen Gems will be calling any moment to put that pull-quote on their DVD cover box.)"
1,Rotten,"Takes the sloppy sentiment and cheap, once-a-week aesthetic of television and inflates it into an ugly, self-consciously respectable film. There's not a genuine moment in it."
1,Rotten,"Everything from the design to Elfman's score suffers from a ""been there, done that"" feeling."
0,Fresh,"Sandra Bullock (who also produces) takes a lame idea of a script, splashes her considerable allure all over it, and comes away with an amiable, light-hearted holiday charmer."
1,Rotten,"David Hyde Pierce playing a guy who isn't sure if he's straight? Groundbreaking cinema, that."
1,Rotten,"While much of the film's action ... comes live, as opposed to the digital mayhem of the game, Thai director Kaos (a.k.a. Wych Kaosayananda), making his inauspicious Hollywood debut, still can't breathe any life into it."
1,Rotten,"""Prince of Persia"" certainly has some entertainment value, but it suffers in the story department because it continually tries to fill the film with too much action."
0,Fresh,"There's a melancholy hanging over the film, too -- that it's [Melissa] Mathison's final screenwriting credit. It's also a lovely exit for a woman who always knew to never write down to her audience, children or not."
0,Fresh,A quiet film.
0,Fresh,"The movie is by turns a romance, a chick flick, a coming-of-age film and even a stoner movie. There's something for everyone, with the possible exception of cretins who don't appreciate great writing, casting, directing and especially acting."
0,Fresh,"With gorgeous cinematography and playful narration from John C. Reilly, it's a Goldilocks film -- one that will juuust right for mamma bears, papa bears and baby bears alike."

0,Fresh,"It's ultimately a pretty sad story, and definitely not a flattering one."
0,Fresh,"Marriages, children, an aneurysm and drinking problem fill out the warts-and-all bio/doc. In so many ways, Quincy is an integral part of American history."
1,Rotten,By mixing a detective story and futuristic robots the filmmakers were likely aiming for the next Blade Runner. They wound up with the next Battlefield Earth.
1,Rotten,I thought apes in the future were hairy humans with walnut shells for mouths! These look too much like monkeys. If I want to watch monkeys take over the world I'll watch the Jersey Shore.
1,Rotten,"Overall this movie is an exciting thrill ride of violent horror, but, unfortunately, without much else to hold on to."
1,Rotten,"A polite tip of the hat to Evil Dead and all things Buffy, this horror/comedy is lacking proper oomph in both categories, resulting in a movie of commendable purpose, but lackluster realization."
0,Fresh,"Prime may not work as a whole movie, but the sum of its parts is remarkable."
1,Rotten,"Yes, there are a handful of interesting insights into friendship but when the film aims for funny it falls flat and the faltering romance between Vaughn and Connelly is never developed nearly enough to make us care."
1,Rotten,"A 'Power Rangers' on steroids with an inane plot, cliche-ridden dialogue, cardboard characters and stilted acting."
1,Rotten,"Slow, talky and reductive."
0,Fresh,"Gone Baby Gone goes beyond just being a good mystery. This is a film with something valid to say about child welfare, and it imparts its message with passion, depth, and grace."

1,Rotten,"Like Black's craven filmmaker, Jackson swells into a madman impresario, so hell-bent on topping himself that he doesn't know when to cut and run."
1,Rotten,an ordeal by tedium
0,Fresh,The film shows its toothless nature when it refuses to properly eviscerate Emma Roberts's silly tweenie pop star. But there are worse crimes than being just a little bit too nice.
0,Fresh,"Is 'Ruby Sparks' named for the fiery static generated by Dorothy's slippers when the talons of the Wicked Witch come near? As in 'The Wizard of Oz,' dreams and reality overlap here, and magic can hurt."
0,Fresh,The portrayal of a super-power being inherited down the maternal line of a family of black women is extremely potent and will resonate with many.
1,Rotten,Ends up reducing its hero's struggle (and bad attitude) to a single past trauma and its resultant daddy issues.
0,Fresh,"Freakonomics's four sections offer various takes on the source book's premise: what happens when you ask ""a different kind of question entirely""?"
1,Rotten,"... never manages to find a story in the unfocused, rambling piece, merely cautionary lessons and a scared-straight message."
0,Fresh,"Reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project, this cleverly-conceived scream fest was shot entirely with a shaky hand-held camera being operated by one of the film's central characters."
1,Rotten,"After doing something imaginative with ""The Jungle Book,"" it's a bit disappointing to watch Favreau play it all so cautiously."
0,Fresh,"[The] huge popularity of this film, still uncontested after so many years, really shouldn't be that surprising."
0,Fresh,"Credit where it's due: Director Ron Howard, also back from Da Vinci, keeps things moving fast enough -- the clock is ticking, after all -- that you don't linger over the implausibility of the story."
1,Rotten,"There are no more ingratiating characters in the popular culture than Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny, but even their monumental charisma is sorely tested in this charmless, vastly overhyped and greedily overmerchandised [film]."
1,Rotten,"As the war drags on, ""Warriors of the Rainbow"" outstays its welcome. I've never seen more severed heads in a film and cared less."
0,Fresh,Compelling lead performance saves violent Bolivar biopic.
1,Rotten,"Many twists, over the top performances, and nods to comedies from the '50s that feel out of place. [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,"Much has been said about McCarthy, an amiable +-size lady, as a viable movie star but there is no longer any question. Brash, bold and believable at every turn, Spy is a showcase and a celebration of her as a performer."
1,Rotten,"There are more than enough giant logic holes, stilted characters and idiotic developments to make sure that it is bad for reasons transcending its simple poorness as a sequel"
1,Rotten,The low-down dirtiest of shames.
1,Rotten,"Things went fairly disastrously wrong at the casting stage, and got worse from that point ..."
0,Fresh,"Eye-popping dance-floor awesomeness and jaw-dropping dramatic awfulness combine to produce the must-see dumbest movie of the year and possibly even of the 21st century -- and yes, I know we've still got nine decades to go."
0,Fresh,"With only 74 slowly unfolding shots, it's closer to gallery installation than conventional cinema, but for audiences open to the experience, it's inexplicably compelling."
0,Fresh,The drama is well crafted and sometimes touching.
0,Fresh,"One of the ten best films of 2011, and the year's best popcorn movie."
0,Fresh,The fog of war frames a sprawling romantic fable and epic mystery.
1,Rotten,"It is almost unbearably long. It is a narrative film without any real narrative, and although it is a movie about three characters, those characters are seen almost exclusively in terms of their limiting relationship."
0,Fresh,"Every one of the bunch is memorable, and each plays gracefully into the action of the film."
1,Rotten,"Whatever charms it had on the stage have apparently been lost in the transition, leaving us with a tedious, tacky lump."
0,Fresh,"Denis tries her hand at science fiction, but done in her naturalistic, heady style that trades high tech science in favor of exploring what deep space isolation can do on one's mental state. It's an arthouse meditation on time, death, and solitude."
1,Rotten,"Frank Miller's adaptation of the antique comic strip by Will Eisner is brash, noisy and so alarmingly ill-paced that it should, by rights, come with a software package that allows viewers to recut it as they see fit."
0,Fresh,"What Snow White was to the advancement of hand-drawn animation into a genuine art form, so is The Adventures of Tintin is to animation derived from motion capture and generated from a computer."
0,Fresh,It's highly worth discovering and would make for a deserving contender for Foreign Language Film at the Oscars if the cards shake out right.
1,Rotten,"Kitchen Sink Realism Paddy Chayefsky style and Bette Davis as a frumpy Bronx housewife sounds like contradiction in terms, and it is."
0,Fresh,Works like 'Sonic the Hedgehog' represent great advances in a cause that already seemed to be lost. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Rough Night is the latest in the ""women behaving badly"" subgenre, but aside from McKinnon and some residual ""woke""-ness, there's little to distinguish it from its Y-chromosome counterparts."
0,Fresh,"Bright, breezy and just a little forgettable."
0,Fresh,"It's the year's best movie so far, and a rarity among countless dramatizations that claim to be based on actual events. In this one the events ring consistently-and dramatically-true."
1,Rotten,"It's a movie that becomes so taken with itself, that it seems to be doing the laughing instead of the viewer."
1,Rotten,Too bloated with its own significance to deliver the requisite thrills.
0,Fresh,"A sly, strange and subtly engaging horror story that will no doubt leave several viewers angry, confused, or arguing on twitter."
1,Rotten,"The movie is packed with fun banter and set pieces, but it's not really about anything, and the ending falls flat."
0,Fresh,"The magic of Limits is that Jarmusch has used rigorous formalism to construct what feels like a loose, dreamy continuum of ideas."
0,Fresh,Probably the best superhero ever made. So many deft touches.
0,Fresh,Peter Weir crafts his film like Hitchcock's Lifeboat on steroids
0,Fresh,"British director Danny Boyle's sequel to 1996's wildly exuberant exploration of the drug culture in Scotland has all the original players, but not much of a plot."
1,Rotten,...the schizophrenic screenplay by Max Landis can't decide if it wants to make you laugh or cringe at the bloodshed.
0,Fresh,You've got to admire a franchise targeted to adolescent girls that is hiply aware of its characters' humor and hankerings and isn't the least bit embarrassed by their smarts and achievements.
0,Fresh,"While the fictitious Albert Brooks takes us cheerfully into his confidence, the Albert Brooks behind the camera sees through him with hilarious clarity."
0,Fresh,Both perfectly classic and remarkably fresh.
1,Rotten,... a film with all the subtlety and bouquet of a screw-top bottle of wine purchased in the bargain bin of your local supermarket.
0,Fresh,"Far less austere than the landscape it shows, Antarctica: A Year On Ice sometimes verges on the corny. But it reveals two polar worlds - the natural and the human - that are fascinating and unfamiliar."
0,Fresh,"The movie's a mixed bag, but worth seeing for the good stuff, which is a lesson in how productive it can be to allow characters to say what they might actually say."
0,Fresh,A successful experiment. Soderbergh's timing couldn't be better with the economic downturn and celebrity downfalls so much in the news these days. Good job!
0,Fresh,"If you settle in to spend a little time with complicated characters on their own terms, Shirley is a beautiful change of pace."
0,Fresh,"This Monster House is a real fun house. It's a 3-D animated kids' film built on classic gothic horror lines, a jokey, spooky Goonies for the new millennium."
1,Rotten,"Cameron, Clooney, and Soderbergh go cloning in the Other 'Solaris'"
0,Fresh,Go into Mindhunters with the right expectations and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised.
0,Fresh,"The Merchant-Ivory team ... tackle Henry James' dense, complex final novel and pull it off with decorous poise."
0,Fresh,The surprising twists and turns in the final act are both powerful and haunting.
0,Fresh,"Gloriously weird and wonderful, and may Mr. Stanton's line about 'ordinary people' long resound."
0,Fresh,"A unique and compelling take on a pulpy, well-worn subgenre of horror."
1,Rotten,"As a consequence of Bennett Miller's relentless de-dramatization, Foxcatcher offers us next to nothing of utility or complexity about du Pont's pathology."
0,Fresh,"You don't take any of this seriously for a minute, but you can't take your eyes off the screen."
1,Rotten,There's little doubt where Cormac McCarthy-bashing Sparks's allegiances lie. The Longest Ride is truly no country for old ambiguity.
0,Fresh,"Interaction between digital figures and human beings is so remarkably seamless that, after just a few minutes, one stops marveling and simply accepts the miracles as a kind of matter-of-fact naturalism."
0,Fresh,A vanity project? Hardly; more like the work of an accomplished filmmaker who knew exactly what type of movie she wanted to make.
0,Fresh,A rigorous and bracingly charming movie about moviemaking.
0,Fresh,"It's fun to watch the clever, dryly comic, quintessential can man's con."
0,Fresh,"The Magnificent Seven isn't a masterpiece, not even close. But it is an action-packed and thoroughly enjoyable piece of commercial cinema that should keep those who like this shoot-out, stand-off, saloon-bar kind of thing highly entertained."
0,Fresh,"Gimmicky, pat, and just a tad too brutal at times, Imagining Argentina is a powerful statement rendered oddly ineffectual by a consistent desire to avoid controversy."
0,Fresh,"A gripping film noir, all the more effective for being staged by Milestone as a steamy romantic melodrama."
1,Rotten,"Caine's geriatric slasher may have gripes against UK youngsters with bad behavior. But the 'don't trust anyone under thirty' carnage, is really not the role model example that the elders should be setting, by killing 'em all and sorting 'em out later."
0,Fresh,A very funny movie for adults and children alike.
0,Fresh,"While watching Beloved, I could easily see one of the best films of the year within, but it ultimately let me down in its penultimate moments."
1,Rotten,It can become tiresome to watch von Trier bash the United States while realizing that he doesn't have a full understanding of what he's attacking.
1,Rotten,Looks like a moviemaker stretching in the wrong direction.
1,Rotten,'Emmerich es un cineasta que tiene estupendos momentos de entretenimiento a pesar de que a media película todo se vaya a la borda.'
0,Fresh,A well built script that balances the professional work aspect of journalism while also showing how this affects their personal lives. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,The strange and engaging tale of this deepvoiced (deep-throated?) diplomat.
0,Fresh,Happy Death Day 2U barely even touches the horror genre.
0,Fresh,"Like many documentaries of this genre, it was made by fans, for fans. Even casual observers, though, can see that Hicks was talented, a conflicted young man who deserved more success than he ever got."
1,Rotten,Visual spectacle and entertaining individual scenes can't fully compensate for an overstuffed epic that [...] carries very little feeling or emotional weight.
1,Rotten,"A montage of Mandy Moore moments, it has the flavor of a big slice of white bread."
0,Fresh,A disturbing horror movie with the sort of burned-in-your-brain sequences that will jolt you awake in the middle of the night.
0,Fresh,The show belongs to Shannon and her transcendentally dorky creation.
0,Fresh,"Having the presence and dramatic lineage of three characters the Prequels weren't afforded the luxury of accessing (Han, Leia and Luke) adds some gravitas to proceedings."
1,Rotten,A hack job with stereotypical characters.
1,Rotten,Even as they've smoothed the novel's rough edges... the filmmakers have tried to cram a maximum number of its incidents into about two hours of screen time. This gives the picture a hectic pace that adds to its feeling of weightlessness and unreality.
0,Fresh,"While frustratingly vague in terms of character and motivation, The Possession is among the more competent of recent studio horror efforts. If only that wasn't the best thing I could say about it."
0,Fresh,Go figure that the year's most outrageously harrowing action movie turns out to be an arthouse doc from National Geographic.
1,Rotten,"""Good Boys"" is fast-paced and energetic, but its bad-taste humor seldom rises above the pedestrian."
0,Fresh,"""The Death of Stalin"" makes real-life horrors the source of hilarity - and it is hilarious - while never making light of the insanity that inspired it."
0,Fresh,"Collyer has a keen eye for underrepresented populations, but she'd be better served in the future to scale back on the overstatement."
1,Rotten,"Has some cool glimmers of what the series did best, showing a real guy reacting to the mythology of Santa Claus. Unfortunately, more than 2/3 of the film is made up of silly, cartoonish antics that are more embarrassing to watch than they seemed to perfor"
1,Rotten,"The writer-director Sophie Barthes does her best to keep things moving, but the film runs out of steam about halfway through."
1,Rotten,"""The Bag Man"" has more attitude than panache. Yes, we eventually get to see what's in the bag. But by the time its contents are revealed, you may no longer care."
0,Fresh,"Ostlund is a gifted creator of malignant ambience, which he masterfully uses to keep his audience wound tight and unsure whether the payoff in catastrophe will be physical, emotional or both."
1,Rotten,Brothers is ultimately like someone remaking a recipe that worked before but altering a few essential ingredients. It doesn't taste as good and only makes you wonder why anyone thought to make it again.
1,Rotten,"...the movie remains wholly unable to capture one's interest for virtually the entirety of its plodding, padded-out runtime..."
0,Fresh,"The Sterile Cuckoo is not as good as it should have been because it lacks consistency of tone. But parts of it are awfully good, and Miss Minnelli is one hell of an actress."
0,Fresh,"Whether you personally agree with the leaking of classified documents, by the end of the movie you at least understand Snowden's headspace, and that's a credit to [Gordon-Levitt's] performance."
1,Rotten,Not that many of the young fans who have turned Lara Croft into one of the history's first cyber-celebrities are likely to miss the lack of emotional depth.
1,Rotten,Taylor Sheridan is a talented storyteller who's starting to seem like a bit of a meathead. This is a beautiful movie with some ugly impulses.
1,Rotten,"It's the personal testimonies that lend this film its purpose, but Macfarlane uses them to serve Weinstein's story, when it really ought to be the other way around."
0,Fresh,It's well worth taking a look at how a fascist-like government operates in America.
0,Fresh,"It's a serviceable commercial film, never boring and mostly fun. Only the comparison to its predecessors makes it seem wanting."
0,Fresh,Robin Williams delivers a moving performance.
1,Rotten,Feature length films should no longer be hand drawn if the studios want the public to shell out fifty bucks to take the family to see them on the big screen.
0,Fresh,Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas lacks symmetry. But never is it remotely ho-hum.
0,Fresh,"Elliptical, lyrical and provocative film and filled with visual poetry. It defies genre while remaining unpredictable and refreshingly un-Hollywood."
1,Rotten,"If a horror picture is supposed to scare its audience, then this one has misplaced that goal with an onslaught of broken limbs, chipped-out teeth, and melting pussycats."
1,Rotten,This low-rent frat house comedy is at once far more vulgar and decidedly less anarchic than its obvious inspiration and should flunk out of theaters before this year's crop of freshman students even finish unpacking their bags.
0,Fresh,"While the icy atmosphere and blood-curdling violence remain, there's a forward momentum and turn towards Bond-esque action that director Fede Alvarez has brought to what looks to be a revitalized franchise."
1,Rotten,"Director Marc Forster can't do much with the stale human story, in which Pitt leaves his frightened wife and daughters on an aircraft carrier to await his return."
0,Fresh,"A beautiful, haunting ode to the impermanence of everything-and the precious, mundane, sometimes mysterious moments that make up the music of life."
0,Fresh,"he started working... before Rome fell to the Allies and shot his drama of partisans fighting the Germans and the Italian Fascists in the streets of the liberated city, amidst the poverty and devastation and uncertainty of the future."
1,Rotten,"Singer can only touch on the surface of each development. It would help if we could see the failure reflected in von Stauffenberg's one good eye, but Cruise, alas, can offer little help. He's just Tom Cruise in an eyepatch."
1,Rotten,"Hoffman injects as much wit, humour and pace into an essentially dry sequence of events as possible... yet even the film's ironclad performances can't save The Last Station from a distinct lack of action."
0,Fresh,A small story [that] also inspires awe.
1,Rotten,"An utterly negligible martial-arts flick--cheap-looking, clumsily written, and not even very well staged, fight-wise."
1,Rotten,Fallen Kingdom leans heavily on action while shortchanging build up.
0,Fresh,a fun little movie that really strikes a balance between comfortable friendliness and crazy silliness
1,Rotten,What were they thinking? Simple: They weren't.
0,Fresh,"Displaying a storytelling confidence unseen in most genre pictures, The Ring succeeds in being the most terrifying film to hit theaters since The Blair Witch Project."
0,Fresh,Clever packaging of boy fantasy and girl fantasy.
1,Rotten,Script characterizations so shallow that even a lead actor as dull as Matthew McConaughey can't be blamed very much.
0,Fresh,This fantastically weird cartoon is definitely one of the most intriguing movies of the year.
0,Fresh,In America is a movie that believes in magic
0,Fresh,Her is a gorgeous fable about the way technological innovation is always a crapshoot and about the way such inadvertently violent changes can poke at the human heart. Jonze navigates such tricky spaces with a warmth he's never before shown.
0,Fresh,"A film that must be seen by any true Joy Division fan, but also entertaining enough as an introduction to this influential band and its troubled singer."
0,Fresh,"Plays like a string of minor conflicts and resolutions instead of one great, overarching crusade."
0,Fresh,"Their freedom on the open road is a ramble, and so American Honey rambles, too. As it should. The movie's cumulative effect is what makes it such a stunning piece of work."
0,Fresh,Certainly smart enough to please fans hungry--as Homer always is--for a super-sized helping of their favorite TV family.
1,Rotten,Garner's moxie can't lift Elektra above its sluggish storytelling
1,Rotten,Long and undisciplined.
0,Fresh,"No clue what ""Shaun the Sheep"" is? It really doesn't matter here. After ten minutes, the whole gang will feel like old friends."
0,Fresh,It has enough pace and excitement to keep action fans switched on.
0,Fresh,"Anderson definitely has a flair for creating a diffuse sense of fear, paranoia, and mental illness onscreen."
1,Rotten,"Isn't an awful film because it's Eddie Murphy, it's awful because most of the ""comedy"" presented is flat, lacking in any hint of timing, and is dated by about thirty years..."
1,Rotten,"This Eminem-produced rap drama attempts to flip the script by both exploiting and harpooning p.c. culture, but generally defaults to fistfights and lazy insults."
0,Fresh,"Without getting grand or preachy, the Sprechers use an unconventional approach to coax us into asking ourselves fundamental questions."
0,Fresh,"The film is not riotous, but it is sporadically amusing, and the love affair is respectful of the characters, not fatuous."
0,Fresh,"Even to call ""Les Enfants du Paradis"" a mere masterpiece, seems a slight."
1,Rotten,"Merely ""playing with concepts"" doesn't quite add up to a film, and ""The Family Fang,"" adapted from Kevin Wilson's novel, feels like an extended therapy session."
0,Fresh,"You suspect something is going to go wrong, and of course it will; after all, the best that can happen is that they will grow up to become us."
0,Fresh,Sitting in theater its hard not to get swept up in Branagh's old-fashioned cinematic magic.
0,Fresh,Blood on Her Name is a compelling noir thriller from the point of view of an unreliable protagonist.

0,Fresh,The film has its dubious pleasures.
0,Fresh,"Truly a great film, much smarter than most thrillers."
1,Rotten,"Sex and the City, which feels like a behind-numbing six episodes strung clumsily together, could be much fun in the hands of a veteran director."
0,Fresh,Tangerine could be a bellwether: casting transgender actors in transgender roles.
0,Fresh,It's truly a fascinating mind game that twists and turns itself into your subconscious.
0,Fresh,I can't decide if The Little Hours is a raunchy comedy about a group of nuns in the middle ages or a feminist statement about how women have always been treated like objects.
1,Rotten,Adam Sandler imagines himself as the savior of the planet. And then it gets even more puffed up with arrogance and all manner of masturbatory fantasy.
0,Fresh,"If the film fails to click on all the emotional levels that Disney might have wanted, at least it's a brightly-paced bit of comedy and fun."
1,Rotten,There's much too much goo over our hero's moral decline and sudden redemption.
0,Fresh,"I like the audacity of what it's willing to throw out, the new stuff it's willing to bring in, the new places it's set up to go and the fresh 21st Century angle enough that I wish the rest of it wasn't merely ""pretty darn good."""
0,Fresh,"The Wolfpack is a reminder that much of the ""crap"" we decry has the potential to liberate, offering a bridge off the island of terror we call the nuclear family."
0,Fresh,"While it runs a little long, the fine acting by the outstanding cast and the high production values make this an entertaining trip."
0,Fresh,"Cohen is such a mesmerizing narrator of his own life, it's a shame the sound bites don't dig deeper; there's probably a first-rate autobiography in the outtakes."
0,Fresh,In many ways Sully is the Clint Eastwood-iest movie Clint Eastwood has ever made.
0,Fresh,"M:I:3 is big, cacophonous entertainment, crackling and explosive, a giant bag of Pop Rocks for the eyes."
1,Rotten,Dreyfuss never seems to get far enough into his character to make his anguish -- or his decision to fight -- real.
0,Fresh,Watching Dale and Francis grow close is a subdued experience that evolves in quiet ways.
0,Fresh,"If this film doesn't inspire you, nothing will."
0,Fresh,"This is an unabashed fairy tale. But as wish-fulfilment fantasies go, it has more than a few funny moments and makes the effort to ground itself in reality."
0,Fresh,A nuanced look at a harrowing true story.
0,Fresh,Polished and seductive
0,Fresh,Isaac's folk-singing Llewyn Davis may be an arrogant loser and the butt of a cosmic joke but he's something more than a cartoon. So is the movie ...
0,Fresh,"After four Tyler Perry feature films, we finally have the very first official knockoff with This Christmas. Of course, with such an honor comes a delicious twist: it's miles ahead of anything Perry could muster."
0,Fresh,It's an over-ambitious pop culture spread that should please hip-hop history buffs and absolutely delight those with a healthy distaste for authority.
0,Fresh,The action in So Close is so giddily relentless that it makes you realize how stodgy most American tough-guy movies are.
0,Fresh,The Kid Who Would be King is a perfect example of the family film of immense quality that seems to have been lost in the last two decades. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"If any piece of art-house cinema can be called an essential, this mesmerizing, haunting work can."
0,Fresh,"There is an entertaining lightness to the frantic efforts of these two lovers to re-connect. Of course, the joke is on them for the real matchmaker is fate/destiny/God."
0,Fresh,"""Silent Souls"" is hardly long, yet the camera's repeated focus on the wintry, gray country road they're traveling can feel somewhat ponderous -- like life itself, as one of the guys in the film might wryly point out."
0,Fresh,A good western.
1,Rotten,...strangely uninvolving...
1,Rotten,"90 percent of it isn't bad enough to be funny, while 100 percent of it isn't good enough to be good."
0,Fresh,DeMonaco strikes a nice balance between the message and the mayhem as he bounces between the philosophical demons inside the Sandin home and the sadistic demons waiting outside.
0,Fresh,"""Girls of the Sun"" has an air of authenticity and grit that's convincing, and Farahani, an Iranian-born actress, makes us care."
1,Rotten,"The end result is a a confusing and muddled message about the ""purity"" of fandom."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the screenplay by Lem Dobbs, which is based on the novel by Neil Gordon, doesn't match up with the vast talent gathered here."
0,Fresh,Deflates the pomp of the action genre's posturing with hilarious precision.
0,Fresh,"""Let the Fire Burn"" offers a searing picture of how dumb and dangerous humans can be."
0,Fresh,"History buffs obviously will appreciate the heft and thought behind ""Anthropoid,"" which is the code name of the murder plot, but the startling gunfight during its climax becomes the stuff of unyielding action movies, too."
0,Fresh,"Furious 7 is respectful, even solemn, when it needs to be, but is still, thank God, plenty of crazy fun."
1,Rotten,"Rio is less a Pixar-level pleasure than a busy, frantic, and overstuffed dessert of a movie. There's scarcely a moment that isn't straining to entertain you."
0,Fresh,"The cast of We're the Millers is having so much fun, it's infectious."
0,Fresh,The clarity of the film's images is like a slap to the face confronting us with a past that is at times too much to bear.
0,Fresh,"A silly script nicely delivered, peppered with some super fun action set-pieces and pleasing twists and turns make this latest mission impossible a good time at the cinema."
0,Fresh,"boils down Rowling's brick-thick novel into a fat-free, fleet-footed adventure... although Rowling's readers may be disappointed to find that much of the story's color has been sacrificed in the name of economy..."
1,Rotten,It's the two Coreys at the height of their popularity; make sure your children avert their eyes... by gouging them out if necessary.
0,Fresh,"Dry, if painstakingly-detailed, account of how four of the proverbial smartest guys in the room accurately predicted the global financial collapse of 2008."
1,Rotten,Horrific and dated....worth seeing from a strictly historical standpoint.
1,Rotten,The performances are solid but I walked out of the theater thinking I might have been equally edified and entertained reading the man's Wikipedia entry.
0,Fresh,"The outstanding set pieces give the viewer an idea of the job pressures, its perks, pitfalls and how the news is in the long run compromised."
0,Fresh,A fierce film with great performances by Fassbender and Winslet. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Despite Theron's bold, aching performance, Marlo remains an avatar of some more general experience. The richness of her ambivalence and the humanity of her predicament are just apparent enough to frustrate the vast appetite for their fuller expression."
0,Fresh,"Its subtext, which is about sex and violence and the way one often dovetails with the other, and the skill of its making, render it gripping enough."
1,Rotten,Return of the Living Dead Part II lacks the stinging humor Dan O'Bannon brought to the original.
1,Rotten,"Pacing discrepancies aside, it's as if the director is too shy about the material, his style going from haunting to predictable."
0,Fresh,"Although it drags at times and is simply too long, dampening the emotional impact of some key plot points, the fine performances -- particularly Garfield's and a fine closing scene -- will leave you thinking this Spider-Man is still kind of amazing."
0,Fresh,"With its sprawling satire and knockabout tone, 'I'm So Excited' is the closest Almodvar has come in years to early romps like 'Labyrinth', 'Pepi, Luci, Bom' and 'What Have I Done to Deserve This?'"
0,Fresh,"In his feature debut, writer-director J Blakeson has concocted a grimy, twisty tale that occasionally pushes plausibility but is buoyed by three strong central performances."
1,Rotten,"The thing is, there's also a lot of better stuff out there on this theme, and so although this isn't wholly awful, there's not much reason to give it 90 minutes of your life."
1,Rotten,Sophie Hyde barely elaborates on the toll James's transition takes on him and only superficially as it affects Billie's psyche.
0,Fresh,"... the story of lust, love and betrayal intriguingly bemoans racism and prejudice of bygone times while peppering the 'history' with more modern references ..."
0,Fresh,"An intriguing journey into an imaginative fantasy scenario, filled with strange surprises."
0,Fresh,"An old-style Hollywood love story, a multi-hanky weeper."
1,Rotten,"With no names given to the characters, you never have to remember them. But it's really best to forget about all of ""Amnesiac."""
0,Fresh,"Leaves its audience with a lot to think about both regarding the implications of its premise, but what it has to say about toxic relationships, social expectations and the way we do (or don't) take ownership of our lives."
0,Fresh,O filme cativa por sua simplicidade.
0,Fresh,"The Mist is a creature feature in which the monsters are almost incidental, but the panic and fear-mongering that comes with the territory is what ultimately causes the most chaos."
1,Rotten,...more of a high-tech extravaganza than a touching fantasy.
0,Fresh,"There's something inherently compelling about the situation, even if the movie screwed up on the specifics."
0,Fresh,"... Notes on a Scandal is an intelligent script, brilliantly acted and well directed by Richard Eyre. You can't ask much more."
0,Fresh,"Hardy and Nachman's film is the uncommon near-perfect documentary: the filmic elements fade, done so well the viewer focuses on the dogs and their journey."
0,Fresh,"Certainly one of cinema's finest explorations of an incredibly specific dynamic - that of the cultural giant and the reporter who fantasizes about one day being as great as his subject, and in the same field."
0,Fresh,"Verhoeven's strong suits have always been visual energy and a Rabelaisan realism: a gutsy, jovial way of ripping through social systems."
0,Fresh,"Temuera Morrison and Nicole Scherzinger are terrific voicing Moana's loving parents. Dwayne Johnson shines as Maui. First and foremost, though, is Auli'i Cravalho, winning the day and carrying the movie as the wonderful and quite lovable Moana."
0,Fresh,"An unhurried, louche thriller that gives way to claustrophobia as it starts to get its clammy hands around your neck."
0,Fresh,"A sumptuous, century-spanning romantic epic ... in other words, the last thing you'd expect from Neil LaBute"
0,Fresh,"A stylish, hard-edged melodrama, and it's a wonderful showcase for Stamp."
0,Fresh,"An excellent complement to the novel, simplifying the science without dumbing it down yet retaining the suspense and urgency of its interplanetary stranding."
0,Fresh,"Romantic, action-packed and always held together by an intriguing social conscience, Slumdog Millionaire is a rapturous crowd pleaser."
0,Fresh,"[Gugu Mbatha-Raw] delivers a laudable, restrained, and complex performance. [Full review in Spanish]"

1,Rotten,"If von Trier can't be bothered to get out more, he should at least consider picking up a book or just using some real imagination."
1,Rotten,"A patchwork of set pieces, held together by a hip soundtrack."
1,Rotten,"There's a sneakiness to this film's first two acts, as if writer-director David Freyne is desperately trying to convince you that ""The Cured"" isn't headed for the zombie-movie third act that it obviously, inevitably is."
0,Fresh,"It has a barbed sense of humour, a thankful disbelief in military might and a sense of scale that comes with a mocking physicality. Swallowed whole or swatted like flies, human beings are insignificant distractions in this lost world."
0,Fresh,"Fast, bloody and flamboyant."
0,Fresh,"Director Doug Liman, working with a screenplay that was on a shortlist of Hollywood's best unproduced works, is a master at using edits and camera angles as a tool for heightening anxiety."
0,Fresh,"The film manages to create a brooding atmosphere that slowly tightens its grip, sloughing off familiar tropes concerning race and sexuality and hitting enough subtle notes to become more intense the more quiet it becomes."
1,Rotten,Dull and awful.
1,Rotten,When exactly did Cameron Crowe movies turn into extended therapy sessions?
0,Fresh,"All of this is cause for consistent smiling and a few outright laughs, without ever building to complete comedy."

1,Rotten,"Loud, grisly, action-packed and profoundly un-scary."
0,Fresh,"Gelbakhiani is the linchpin who makes the film really work, occupying the screen wonderfully as Merab, communicating the lust, frustration, anger, and determination necessary for the role."
0,Fresh,"A few moments of slackness notwithstanding, the tale is emotionally gripping to the end."
0,Fresh,"This romance is powerful in fits and starts, capturing a golden-ager sensuality that almost never gets screen time -- at least not with this sort of unsentimental candor."
0,Fresh,"You know, it's kind of block-headed. But it's exactly what you'd expect from action director Michael Bay. And hey, it is about robot-like creatures, after all."
0,Fresh,"... a minor triumph ... compact, impeccably performed ... Ethan Hawke's Great Santini-like father deserves a close look by Oscar ... the gutsy ending left us gasping."
0,Fresh,"One wrong move could have thrown the whole movie off, but Powley gets it right again and again. And so does the cast and crew."
0,Fresh,"While West Of Memphis won't surprise anyone who's followed the case, it does play its own role, particularly in illuminating how unsatisfying the end of the story really was."
1,Rotten,"It's ... a mess. The movie is shot through with curious disconnects. Often within a single sequence of events, we won't know where we are, or how they're related in space or time."
0,Fresh,"The Wave is less a conventional disaster movie than a movie that happens to be about a disaster, a small distinction that makes a world of difference when it comes time to care what happens to any of these people ..."
0,Fresh,"Directed by Brad Bird, The Iron Giant is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking."
1,Rotten,Gosford Park earns the most dreaded label of all: overrated.
0,Fresh,"Book Club has a script that's often so heavy on the corn... But then, darn it, suddenly it makes you tearful, with an unexpectedly genuine moment, or laugh out loud."
0,Fresh,"Enlivened by pacey direction and likeable comic performances, though there's a strong sense of having seen it all before and some of the jokes are a little misguided."
0,Fresh,"Through interviews with family, friends and colleagues, it provides an entertaining, telling look at both the man and his beliefs."
0,Fresh,"With the help of a well-informed screenplay by journalist Mark Boal, Bigelow dispenses with the red-wire/blue-wire lies Hollywood told you and replaces them with a heady brew of documentary realism and action poetry."
0,Fresh,Spotty and fitfully very funny. Lacks the structure of the other Python big screen films.
0,Fresh,"Initially, this low-budget film writes a lot of checks on the First National Bank of Whimsy, but I was astonished when none of them bounced."
0,Fresh,"In the hands of director Barry Jenkins and playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney, who wrote the theater piece ""Moonlight"" is based on, it's cinematic poetry birthed from the sea, where learning to swim is akin to a baptism."
1,Rotten,"This is a sad case of a film with high and noble intentions that features great dramatic performances, but it ends up being a superficial epic, diluted, limited, and strangely unmoving."
0,Fresh,Purveyors of genre curiosities should definitely put The Love Witch on their list; you'll either fall under its pastel and free love spell or find yourself screaming that you can't handle it. Just like Elaine's victims.
1,Rotten,"For the uninitiated, The X Files: I Want to Believe may seem as musty and forbidding as one of those dank secrets that Mulder and Scully were forever digging up from some backyard, or fetid swamp, or their own aching hearts."
0,Fresh,"Unsurprisingly, with visual mastery and few dialogues, Nolan achieves perhaps his best film. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"An impressive and ambitious achievement, one that manages to feel both meticulous in all its hilarious detail and at the same time, rambunctious and heartfelt."
0,Fresh,"If you saw Now You See Me and enjoyed it, take it from me: you're going to love this sequel, which is pretty much more of the same and then some."
1,Rotten,"""Nurse 3D"" isn't nearly as fun as a movie about a homicidal, sex-obsessed, clothing-averse health care provider ought to be."
1,Rotten,"Violent, salty, slow-moving action drama highlights loyalty."
0,Fresh,"It's a considerable improvement over his last directing effort, the post-apocalyptic disaster The Postman."
0,Fresh,Very funny things happen in practically every scene. I can hardly wait to see the sequel!
1,Rotten,"It's hardly worth seven bucks to see Linnea Quigley, in the flick's wildest scene, thrust a lipstick into her own breast."
0,Fresh,"An unparalleled meeting of Eastern and Western talent, writer-director Daniel Lee's historical blockbuster is entertainment on a grand scale."
0,Fresh,The filmmaker's frankness and sincerity win out over his schematic tying-up of past and present and the stagy historical- recreation feel of the period sections.
0,Fresh,"[VIDEO ESSAY] ...represents the apex of the British Gangster genre for the its realistically gritty tone, fetishized eroticism, and dynamic attention to details..."
1,Rotten,Who thinks it's high time for a movie that spoofs The Blair Witch Project? Hands! Anyone? Anyone? No?
1,Rotten,Good Intentions.....that's about it
0,Fresh,"A film that transforms a popular work of teen fiction not just by faithfully exploring its themes but, more important, by proving those themes have a very grown-up resonance."
0,Fresh,Hitchcock's most disturbing masterpiece.
1,Rotten,It's very sweet and earnest. That's the good news. The bad news is that it's also kind of dull and packed too full of superfluous stuff.
0,Fresh,"Gray's film is so visually stunning in places, you'll wish that Roy would pipe down a bit and let you enjoy it."
1,Rotten,Pretty much the end of Universal's horror line as a home for even the vaguest kind of serious filmmaking.
1,Rotten,"It isn't as consistently funny as some of the 11-minute TV episodes, but fans should be sufficiently absorbed that they'll be able to ignore the fact that it's a little waterlogged."
0,Fresh,"It's a compliment to say that You Don't Nomi had me engaging with, if not completely buying, the opinions of those who find more worth in [Showgirls]."
0,Fresh,"The film isn't the unqualified stroke of brilliance its Sundance honors might indicate, nor is it the overblown failure its detractors might desire."
0,Fresh,Gerwig understands the pains and the humorous discomforts of growing up so acutely that Lady Bird feels like it was made just for you.
0,Fresh,Mike Leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
0,Fresh,"For those interested in a more meditative experience than most horror movies can provide, A Cure for Wellness proves surprisingly effective."
0,Fresh,"Could be the most honest film about military combat ever made. And one of the best, too, focusing as it does on the effects of battle on front-line soldiers in a futile war."
1,Rotten,This is a 24-carat wallow in weapons grade mawkishness.
0,Fresh,A compelling drama that establishes Ryan Gosling as one of the finest actors of his generation.
1,Rotten,The real problem with Next Friday is that the whole movie is so ineptly written and directed that its 90 minutes seem to take twice as long.
0,Fresh,It's a conspicuously stylish attention-getter that heralds the discovery of a major directorial talent.
1,Rotten,"Troubling news from the future: we'll perfect robotics, but still be unable to master a decent toupee."
1,Rotten,Val's condition mainly facilitates some agreeable (if klutzily staged) pratfalls and a few tepid snickers about artistic 'vision.'
0,Fresh,The banter by all these sophisticated Manhattanites is ... refreshingly tart.
1,Rotten,"Keeping Up with the Joneses is not a good movie-it's dumb, boring, and predictable-but it's stacked with an excellent cast, dozens of chuckles, and a handful of legitimately brilliant LOLs."
0,Fresh,"Hart and Hall are downright lovable, their individual live wire comic energies even further elevated in the face of a formidable foil--and that resulting charge also translates into an appropriately volatile and exciting erotic electricity."
0,Fresh,"A screamingly unnecessary sequel... [but] the best-animated of the Disney DTV sequels to that point, by an extraordinary margin."
0,Fresh,"Mike Binder, whose previous work (The Upside of Anger) suggested the possibility of great things, fully arrives with this delicately observed and emotionally expansive drama."
0,Fresh,"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is a bit of a mess, but it is a genial mess, and one that will make you laugh. Which is the whole idea."
1,Rotten,While comparisons to Hostel are inevitable Turistas rarely achieves its level of sustained menace and discomfort.
0,Fresh,Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst are excellent...(The film) is thoroughly engrossing but somewhat frustrating in the end.
1,Rotten,"So, if you're looking for a fun, meaningless throwback thriller, definitely give PSYCHOPATHS a whirl. Otherwise, you might want to stay away entirely."
0,Fresh,"The humor is not necessarily subversive, but it is often subtle and cleverly conceived, which is a super feat indeed."
1,Rotten,"As it stands, the best elements of the film become mired in the unwelcome narrative muck, branding Salmon Fishing in the Yemen the one that got away."
1,Rotten,The cathartic pleasures of a good old-fashioned weepie are promised and then never delivered in Derek Cianfrance's handsome but curiously lifeless The Light Between Oceans.
0,Fresh,"You'll either run with it or you won't, but you can be sure you've never seen anything quite like it."
1,Rotten,"Damaged individuals healing one another is a serviceable idea for a film, but Things We Lost in the Fire is missing an essential component: plausibility."
0,Fresh,"When the movie sticks with this storyline, or with the science-fiction elements of his trip to Earth and his purpose here, it's a compelling new look at one of the most famous origin stories in comics."
0,Fresh,"Jumping from the dreariness of the familial drama to the good cheer of the concluding ceremony proves more than a little jarring, but the tensions inherent in the film's split personality work in its favor."
0,Fresh,"Tense throughout, even for history-savvy auds, but still rich in the sort of Andean-soil-black humor that made Larrain's previous work so distinctive."
0,Fresh,"A reasonably competent, mildly amusing monster mash."
0,Fresh,Echoes themes in Hidden Figures [...] watch this one right now.
0,Fresh,...immeasurably helped by strong performances in the central roles...
0,Fresh,That the compassion comes from characters who exist on the fringes of accepted society only emphasizes the heartbreaking irony of Koreeda's message.
1,Rotten,Johnny Knoxville is moving on up from being a simple Duke of Hazzard to Tennessee's King of Sod. Too bad the royal promotion didn't come with a quality upgrade as well.
1,Rotten,...both a massive disappointment and a missed opportunity.
1,Rotten,"Anytime real drama would take place rather than its amped-up melodrama Sarah's Keyducks out with an ellipsis rather than showing us something that would upset its fragile, middlebrow sensitivities."
0,Fresh,'Halloween' offers more camp than creepiness.
0,Fresh,"While Chopra attempts to crack the American market with a slice of cinematic apple pie, he holds up a mirror to how Hollywood's tried-and-true narrative of vigilantism connotes who we are, at home and overseas."
0,Fresh,An unflinchingly humane work of enormous importance.
0,Fresh,"""Pearl Harbor"" isn't anywhere near what it could have been as a movie, but the battle scenes are astonishing and it has a passable love story."
0,Fresh,"Perhaps the most persuasive argument one can make for seeing ""Yesterday"" - aside from it being charmingly nostalgic, family-friendly and full of great music - is pretty simple: there's truly nothing else out there like it right now."
1,Rotten,"Strip away the modern day polish and the bluster of its gimmicky (though admittedly satisfying) cast and you're left with an 80s-esque action spectacle. That's the point, of course, but it isn't enough to earn the film a genuine recommendation."
1,Rotten,"What might've helped matters would have been a little touch of creativity on the script end, with most every turn seen coming a mile away, and maybe even more importantly, more interference from the secondary players who are completely wasted here."
0,Fresh,Audiences knowing nothing about hockey will still be able to appreciate this movie as a somewhat jaunty take on the cold war and its aftermath - and resurgence.
1,Rotten,Universal is marketing this film for Best Picture is an insult to the Academy's intellect.
0,Fresh,"I admit I feel a little guilty to be praising a production whose aims are so thoroughly modest, but I laughed all the way through this movie."
0,Fresh,Diary of a Country Priest in New York State. A fine Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried. Ending is a bit off the rails.
0,Fresh,"Joker offers enough to make it not a complete waste of everyone's talent, but the movie lacks that extra ""wow"" factor."
0,Fresh,The most interesting aspect of the film is when it questions the definition of an African.
1,Rotten,Relentlessly interesting to watch if somewhat less than compelling as a film.
0,Fresh,"No need to visit the first movie. Really, don't. But this Halloween, Ouija: Origin of Evil is your one stop shop for cinematic terrors."
1,Rotten,The result is a film that has a good heart but no strong humor.
0,Fresh,"See ""Lucy"" simply to watch Johansson kick butt, spout some philosophy and, with the help of CGI, move through time and space with the casual swipe of her palm."
0,Fresh,"If you leave logic at the door, buy the biggest popcorn bucket the theater has to offer, and want to have fun- Furious 7 is the film that will take you on the ride you're looking for."
1,Rotten,A shabby attempt at mixing elements of a teen slasher flick with the lowbrow laughs of a teen sex romp. Neither one adds up to the sum of its whole.
1,Rotten,"Too much of this movie about prison feels only like a movie about prison, with actors posing and directors getting poetic."
1,Rotten,"""Free State of Jones"" is a well-intentioned slog through a potentially fascinating bit of Civil War history, brought to life only by Matthew McConaughey's performance, and then only occasionally."
0,Fresh,"The pacing is swift, the expressions priceless, and the confrontational, situational comedy uproarious."
0,Fresh,I Am Richard Pryor presents a sincere and moving account of the comedian/actor's life and career.
0,Fresh,"I had not seen the film since its original release, but in the intervening quarter of a century it had somehow become more symbolic, self-referential, mythic, and dramatic. In short, the comedy had become a tragedy."
0,Fresh,"It's a must see for the theater. Don't just wait for DVD, or you'll miss out."
0,Fresh,"Gilbert Grape has body and deep flavor, but it can be wonderfully dry too."
0,Fresh,"It's no mean feat drawing comedy from the darkest of topics, yet Foulkes seems blessed with a sureness of touch when siphoning humour from tragedy, eliciting uncomfortable laughs from black moments as she shapes her story into a feminist revenge fable."
1,Rotten,"There's a potent irony between the justice that Kelly, Carlson and others sought and their politics, both in real life and on the screen, that the film never addresses in a satisfactory way. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,There is the expected smattering of slapstick moments and Connick Jr delivers the requisite outdoorman charm to show Renee just how cool the cold can be.
1,Rotten,"Looking to experience the promised darkest and spookiest chapter in The Conjuring universe? Sadly, your prayers have certainly not been answered here. Maybe The Crooked Man will fare a bit better, but for my money? The Nun deserved better."
0,Fresh,So what if it arrives in theaters about five months late? Charlie's Angels is still the best movie of the summer.
0,Fresh,"Still has all the crude, rude fun of its predecessors."
1,Rotten,"If you liked (insert any Verhoeven film here) you'll love Hollow Man! I didn't, so I don't."
1,Rotten,"Even the action, which should be this kind of brainless summer movie's saving grace, is spare and unexciting."
1,Rotten,"Reign of Fire is basically one great set piece surrounded by thickets of iron filings, oily hair and knotty-pine acting."
0,Fresh,"An at times very upsetting film about our true nature, The Stanford Prison Experiment is full of great performances, particularly from Michael Angarano and Ezra Miller."
1,Rotten,"...unhurried if not slow, it at times feels downright deflated as characters wander ponderously through mansions and backyards or drive down crowded highways and empty hillside roadways."
1,Rotten,"A pleasant enough diversion, but DC will be bettered watched from the horizontal position of a couch, one to which the film seems all too eager to send you."
0,Fresh,"Remember the Duplass brothers, writer Mark and director Jay. They seem to be imbued with the talents of the top moviemaking brother acts: the zaniness of the Coens, the insight of the Wachowskis and the comedic spark of the Farrellys."
1,Rotten,"We know we are watching a Shaft movie without even looking up at the screen, as we tune into the wah-wah funk sound of Isaac Hayes' exponential title theme ..."
0,Fresh,"Better Luck Tomorrow is a huge step forward, and though it doesn't fully transcend its small budget, the story feels rooted in something more solid than prefab posturing."
1,Rotten,"It's as if the filmmakers wanted to deliver a bitingly sardonic satire of violence in society, but the studio was forcing them to make a mainstream superhero movie."
1,Rotten,"To give a passing grade to this sloppy, one-note, scatologically obsessed trifle is to propose that the lowest common denominator of entertainment is an altitude hovering thousands of feet above the peak of Mount Everest."
1,Rotten,"Chunks of a pretty good prison movie occasionally bob to the surface of this bleeding-heart biopic about Cameron Todd Willingham. Unfortunately, they eventually drown under waves of blandness and cliche."
1,Rotten,"With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood, Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap."
0,Fresh,"We are never in doubt that it's a comedy, but there are some fairly serious matters and a surprising amount of dramatic action"
1,Rotten,"If you've ever seen another sports movie, you've seen Goal!"
1,Rotten,High Heels' main problem is that Smith can't seem to decide whether the movie is an over-the-top comedy or a sassy action film.
0,Fresh,"Not a great movie, but it's fun to watch Pacino and Walken make an effort."
1,Rotten,Largely a waste of time and talent
1,Rotten,"A soft-core, Jazz Age skin flick masquerading as high art."
1,Rotten,"[VIDEO] An unhappy marriage of brawny big-screen talent with a nonsensical script, and a newbie director, make for one very mediocre action movie."
1,Rotten,"This romantic comedy-drama is, by turns, fizzy and melancholy, nostalgic and clear-eyed, but it never builds to anything especially substantial."
1,Rotten,...the events that transpire in Inside Game are better told as a documentary.
0,Fresh,A consistent stream of chuckles and a lot of convincing heart.
1,Rotten,"It's technically very well made, but the mystery isn't good enough to compensate for Secret Window's mild suspense and murky purpose."
0,Fresh,Let It Snow offers enough feel-good moments to provide a good start to the Netflix Christmas romance season.
0,Fresh,Streep is effervescent in this pleasantly predictable classic rock melodrama
0,Fresh,A mouth-watering and charming - if overlong - romantic comedy-drama about an immigrant family opening an Indian restaurant in a most unlikely location: the South of France.
0,Fresh,"A shrewd, mostly unsentimental portrait about childhood peer relationships and those first few cursory steps toward growing up."
0,Fresh,"Tales are dramatic; the interviewees poignant, and the images -- often following bodies all the way down to the water -- are startling and discomfiting."
0,Fresh,[T]his movie literally gave me the chills.
1,Rotten,The Sentinel is so bland that it wants only to be as good as TV.
0,Fresh,"Jaa's ingratiatingly ridiculous Protector delivers a steady stream of cheap B-movie thrills, + two positive messages for young people: Be nice to animals, and when in doubt, always aim for the tendons."
0,Fresh,"Will Ferrell's elf-portrait is not only funny, but it has got a big heart, too."
1,Rotten,"Everyone in ""The Comedian"" deserves a better movie than ""The Comedian."""
0,Fresh,"Everything gels in Small Time Crooks, thanks largely to the chemistry between Woody Allen and the remarkable Tracey Ullman."
0,Fresh,Another fine effort from a director currently on a critical roll. Hanson is great at teasing the audience with little samples of his star's lyrical dexterity as he builds towards the finale.
1,Rotten,Recommend this one to a friend with a bum ticker. Not a single moment in the 108-minute running time is sufficient to even quicken the pulse.
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the Piersons can be so unpleasant that watching them misbehave in Taveuni becomes a chore."
0,Fresh,"Cameraperson is an entertaining, engaging work, which is surely one of the finest non-fiction films of the year."
0,Fresh,"The movie's power comes less from its contrived story than everything else: the stark setting, chaotic energy and authentic cast."
0,Fresh,"Ne Zha has some shaky storytelling to begin with, but by the second half, it escalates into a full-fledged emotional animated blockbuster."
0,Fresh,It's truly a fascinating mind game that twists and turns itself into your subconscious.
1,Rotten,Half-hearted Flowers for Algernon story. None of the actors seem to really believe it.
1,Rotten,"Cheating, trying to get laid, and attempting to wrangle the opposite sex into marriage or something quite like it, never seemed so dull."
0,Fresh,...like being caught in a barbed-wire fence of ethical dilemmas.
1,Rotten,"There's a great movie in here, but Hawke hasn't quite found it."
0,Fresh,"It's as if we've flipped through an album of beautifully proportioned photographs from which we must reconstruct a life, helped along by a performance that seems almost unbearably brave."
1,Rotten,"Despite its fresh perspective, Banks's Charlie's Angels update fails to capture any of the energy, silliness, or style that made the franchise the beloved phenomenon it is."
1,Rotten,"Post-traumatic hitman disorder afflicting an existential assassin slacker doing down time in Italy without a Mafia in sight, and the standard male screen fantasy of reciprocal hooker romance as high price tag stranger sex blossoms. Eat, Slay, Love."
0,Fresh,"Moreau gives a dominating, award-worthy performance. The combination of the beautiful scenery, musical score and art work resonate into a sensory epiphany for the audience."
0,Fresh,"Refreshingly adult, sweet-tempered and rather special little romantic comedy-drama focusing on a generally underserved age group -- and presenting that group in a new light."
0,Fresh,"Curious film that mixes genres, leaving us a bittersweet flavor and an oscillating feeling between absurd comedy, alienation and the void left by the loss. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"If you like action, this is a fun, fun film, but if you like intelligent drama, prepare to be disappointed."
1,Rotten,"The push-and-pull between the rote royal-family intrigue and the feverish visual design is almost too much, nearly drowning the picture in a sea of self-generating kitsch."
0,Fresh,Eddie Murphy looks like he hasn't had this much fun making a movie in years. He brings all the charm and quick wit from his prime and squeezes it into a portrayal that's equally as affecting on a dramatic level.
1,Rotten,Looking terrified and screaming is really all that's required in David Self's inane script.
1,Rotten,"My expectations going in was that we were getting a more mature explanation of how this really began, but it's just another Purge movie."
0,Fresh,"Shrek was no ordinary animated film, and Shrek 2 is, rarer still, proving every bit as cute, clever and funny as the original."
0,Fresh,"De Niro and Hathaway's characters grow ever closer in their relationship, and even end up literally ""in bed"" together. But it's not what it sounds like."
0,Fresh,"Robert Downey Jr.'s irreverent, Peter Pan-like portrayal of billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) continues to be the movie's strongest asset."
0,Fresh,"It's a nasty piece of work, and work it does."
0,Fresh,"I genuinely enjoyed the look-and-feel of everything here, and while the film isn't as important overall as some other MCU films, it does make for a comfortable rewatch."
0,Fresh,Fair diversion for kids under 10 and parents eager to please them.
0,Fresh,"Some may find the blizzard of ideas and images a little spurious and overpowering, but this is a deeply personal expression of visionary art and love."
1,Rotten,"It's taxing to watch, and Green moves between scenes with Malick-inspired ellipses, frustrating momentum."
1,Rotten,"Best-case fallout from this joyless TV-land lemon: Harrison Ford is driven into retirement, Diane Keaton gets a morning show."
1,Rotten,"Logic, motivation, suspense -- anything that might make the film frightening or resonant-is buried under Dolby blams, medulla-shaming dialogue, and a rain of overdubbed hunting-knife schwings that grate like a 3 a.m. car alarm."
0,Fresh,"The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all, a condition only the old are privy to, and...often misconstrued as weakness."
1,Rotten,Dan Stevens navigates the film's literal and thematic alleyways with the same enthusiastic befuddlement that convinced many to soldier through Legion's more impenetrable stretches.
1,Rotten,"Of course, horror movies have a long history of playing fast and loose with coherence, and expecting excellence from It Chapter Two is a more foolish idea than anything contained in this extremely dumb movie."
0,Fresh,Kill List will scar you emotionally. Do yourselves a favour and don't watch this before bed.
1,Rotten,The story's anti-fascism exoskeleton is heavier than Burton's dark fantasy and its capering evil creatures can bear.
0,Fresh,"Brewer uses these plot machinations to investigate ideas of race, religion and redemption in a way that for most of the film's running time is unusually riveting."
0,Fresh,"Super 8 is a thoroughly entertaining popcorn flick, but one does get the sense of Abrams sweating up a storm in an effort to produce the sort of guileless matinee magic that Spielberg conveyed effortlessly."
0,Fresh,A perfectly calibrated (and generally perfect) feature debut from a director who got exactly what he wanted
0,Fresh,"Rattling the nerves while drawing out its palpable sense of dread, ""The Conjuring"" is a proudly old-fashioned horror movie that tells its story with sophistication and care."
0,Fresh,Spider-Man: Homecoming is not your typical Marvel movie -- and that's exactly what makes it great.
0,Fresh,"Have an out-of-this-world experience with this brilliantly ambitious biopic of history-making astronaut, Neil Armstrong."
0,Fresh,"Like many relationships, Breaking Upwards starts in bed and ends on the street. The journey in between, however, feels as new as anything a tiny budget and a boatload of talent could produce."
0,Fresh,"The film as a whole is a bit underwhelming but based on the strength of it's cast, and the joy in seeing Cage not do a role just for the cash, ""Joe"" will be a worthwhile watch once it hits Netflix."
0,Fresh,The cast of the Phillips and pirate crew are uniformly excellent and authentic as men of equal desperation willing to go to great lengths to achieve even the smallest of victories.
1,Rotten,Solondz presents his characters as such exaggerated monsters that they don't resemble human beings as much as helplessly squirming specimens under his poison-tipped probe.
0,Fresh,"A wild and wacky movie about international politics, terrorism, and the antics of an American trickster."
0,Fresh,"Not a bad tearjerker for the holiday season and as Smith's in it, it'll probably make a mint."
0,Fresh,A long anticlimax.
1,Rotten,Unlikely to satisfy horror fans...but the Spierigs might have a future in this genre if they put more effort and imagination into their scripts.
1,Rotten,"Some of the most utterly unlikable characters you've ever met. The exception is Kate Hudson's Darcy, who is completely detestable."
1,Rotten,Director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) has none of the facility with story and characters that Barry Sonnenfeld displayed on the original picture.
1,Rotten,"Despite its occasional virtues, it eventually reveals itself to be a film that is simply too long, too overblown and not nearly as witty or clever as it clearly thinks itself to be."
0,Fresh,Harry Potter grows up. Harry Potter needs to shave. Harry Potter shows more interest in the young ladies at Hogwarts.
0,Fresh,"Natalia Dyer does a magnificent job in a coming of age story that deals with sex and shame. Filled with charm and innocence, the movie is also very funny."
0,Fresh,This is a movie about battling evil that pauses to ask what evil is and whether it's necessary to understand its nature in order to defeat it.
0,Fresh,"This story of complicated human beings trying to get by in a morally confusing world made director Stephen Frears' name on the international stage, and it remains highly watchable today."
0,Fresh,One of the most generous and reassuring tragicomedies of this or any year.
0,Fresh,There are grownup delights aplenty...from its glorious color palate to the refreshingly angular character design
1,Rotten,"Disney's PG-13 spectacle does a disservice to both fact and fiction with clumsy, cliche writing."
0,Fresh,Solid and well-crafted; neither Eastwood nor Petersen has been quite as good since.
0,Fresh,"Loving Vincent is a bit like ""Starry Night."" It's simple, it's soothing, yet somehow it's unlike anything you've ever seen before."
0,Fresh,Hugh Jackman sharpens his claws in every sense of the word and delivers killer work.
0,Fresh,"Viewers who can get on the film's wavelength will find much to enjoy, but there's no denying the picture is slight in the extreme."
0,Fresh,"With a good sense of humour, strong action set pieces and Hiddleston and Hemsworth on top form, it's just great fun."
1,Rotten,DreamWorks has produced state-of-the-art computer animation but forgotten the state of the heart.
1,Rotten,"The sole purpose of this product was to make more money than anything else before it, generate a reflexive response immune to critical and public opinion, then let it creep back to the mediocre-sea."
1,Rotten,A watch-watching 90-minute horror flick based on the Conjuring Universe formula. You've seen this a dozen times & done better. Not that any of them are all that well done.
0,Fresh,"A triumph. A smart and absurdly funny movie that takes a different view of the war in Afghanistan. Tina Fey is terrific in a different kind of role, and Martin Freeman steals it."
0,Fresh,"There's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas. During fight sequences, the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world, however briefly, from La Motta's perspective."
1,Rotten,Adam Sandler's third movie with Netflix is the very definition of over indulgence.
1,Rotten,"The first 45 minutes are painfully boring...Donna Rice is shamefully misrepresented...This film is a true disappointment, an opportunity squandered."
0,Fresh,"Well-researched and exuberantly compiled, this is a thoroughly entertaining tribute to America's first tackle at surgically implanting the beautiful game."
1,Rotten,It is truly one of the worst films ever made.
0,Fresh,A rote but engaging historical drama about the eternal debate between truth and mythology.
1,Rotten,"unrelentingly smug, for no good reason"
0,Fresh,Visconti used real Sicilian fishermen as non-actors expressing their circumstances and beliefs. The effect is a powerful portrait of graceful human dignity caught between the cruelty of the sea and opportunistic greed.
0,Fresh,"To say that there is tension between Teddy and his teacher is an understatement. It's comedic war, to be frank, with an ensemble of students who all have their own brand of powerful comedy."
0,Fresh,"That rare film that seems to wholly capture a human experience, in all of its tragedy and wonder."
1,Rotten,The movie doesn't give an audience anything that makes sense. How does Harris smoke a cigar that appears to weigh more than he does? And whence is Worthington's accent?
1,Rotten,"Dean Craig's script relies on the cheaper fallbacks from Four Weddings: posh people swearing, posh people stammering, posh people falling off battlements."
1,Rotten,"The genre usually gets the super-slick, smash-cutting, roving-camera treatment, but Full of It feels oddly low key despite the fantastical elements. Some pre-fab parts don't quite fit together."
0,Fresh,"Each actor fills his role nicely, and they have enough chemistry to animate the routine pitfalls this road trip has in store for them."
0,Fresh,"Frenetic and frequently funny, Penguins Of Madagascar represents the DreamWorks Animation franchise style -- which boils down to self-aware, but nave, talking animals who learn kid-friendly life lessons -- at its most palatable."
0,Fresh,"A bitterweet comedy, completely independent and full of love for those who live in the big city. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,The Matrix is too much of an outer-limits head-trip to resist!
0,Fresh,"Rabbit Hole is hardly what you'd call a date movie, and it's difficult to see what kind of audiences it'd appeal to outside of awards season chin-strokers."
0,Fresh,"The handheld camerawork and bleached-out color palette suggest something more akin to combat footage, and candid moments recorded on the sly give Bloody Sunday a chilling realism."
1,Rotten,"Shot like a feature-length commercial, Torque is as bright and shiny and inconsequential as a chrome hubcap."
0,Fresh,"If every superhero franchise had a Robert Downey Jr., the genre might actually be watchable again."
0,Fresh,"Impressively directed and superbly written, this is a powerfully emotional bereavement drama with a deservedly Oscar-nominated performance from Nicole Kidman."
1,Rotten,"Despite the farcical set-ups (involving adjoining hotel rooms, private detectives, and a brusque, busybody therapist played with aching exaggeration by Jennifer Aniston), there's very little here that brings the funny."
1,Rotten,"Feels cut from the cloth of a romance novel for middle-aged respectables, with a fatally under-motivated thriller clumsily tacked on to jazz up the action."
0,Fresh,"Netflix hasn't just elbowed its way to the table where teen rom-coms are released, they've knocked over the table and reset it by their rules."
1,Rotten,"""The Gentleman"" isn't offensive, and it's not even good enough to qualify as coarse. If it weren't mildly annoying, it would be as close to nothing as an experience can be."
0,Fresh,"It's easily one of the best in the series -- the best, in fact, since Leonard Nimoy and the old Enterprise crew saved the whales in ""Star Trek IV."""
0,Fresh,Manages to make space travel both incredibly awe inspiring and fear inducing... These scenes are technical marvels that also manage to keep the emotion and dialogue working in concert.
1,Rotten,Black and Cera posed in cave-man outfits for an amusing poster. Then the movie was brought forth and things went downhill.
0,Fresh,When is Russ Meyer going to be taken seriously as an auteur?
0,Fresh,"Surprisingly, the film is delightful-mostly because of 15-year-old Hayley Mills, the blonde button nose who played the endearing delinquent in Tiger Bay."
0,Fresh,"A longtime indie favorite as an actress, Shelly was really growing as a filmmaker. This is a very good film with a terrific performance from Keri Russell."
0,Fresh,"A celebration of Kubrick, filmmaking and fandom. A must see for any fan of The Shining"
1,Rotten,"""Roach and Randolph made this film to preach to a choir that already have their minds made up."""
1,Rotten,"Neither dud nor gem, this fact-based drama's terrific story is presented with a heavy-hand and superficially."
0,Fresh,"A wedding, a kidnapping and a secret that everybody knows is the focus of this involving film by Asghar Farhadi in which the characters form part of an intricate jigsaw puzzle. It sings with authenticity."
1,Rotten,"Prisoners is weary after ten minutes, and I suppose it has persuaded itself that its length is justified by its solemn gaze into the abyss."
0,Fresh,This 1975 melodrama by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is one of his better middle-period films.
1,Rotten,"Peter Landesman strains to make Omalu's battles feel just and epic in scale, but the drama feels as doughy and shapeless as an athlete too long out of training."
1,Rotten,A tense but ultimately corny family drama.
0,Fresh,"A wrenching, deeply disturbing drama about a kid who finds that his relatives are conscienceless crooks."
0,Fresh,"One of the most satisfying action movies in a long, long time."
0,Fresh,What works best in the film is the over-all vision.
0,Fresh,Frequently very funny and almost always absolutely tongue-in-cheek - but it looks like we'll have to wait a bit longer for the movie which really gets the balance right in presenting a combination of classic drama and high-concept fantasy.
1,Rotten,47 Meters Down is one of the more flawed and forgettable shark movies in recent years.
0,Fresh,"If you like your action well-choreographed, and a plot that's relatively uncomplicated but not dumb, this is pretty much the film for you. There's even some good roof-fighting, which is always a +."
0,Fresh,"Decent if disturbing, but not quite as effective as it could and should have been."
1,Rotten,Manuel Gmez Pereira's frantic direction is nonstop and the exhaustion of excess will get to you.
0,Fresh,As poignant as it is buoyant.
0,Fresh,"A shriller, more mannered actress may have tilted this into camp. Sidibe doesnt allow that to happen."
1,Rotten,"Picturesque scenery doesn't compensate for mediocre performances and a lazy, asinine and increasingly preposterous screenplay that drains all of the fun, suspense, fun, humor and thrills from the film."
1,Rotten,"It has little of the wit and none of the bite of ""A Fish Called Wanda."""
1,Rotten,"No one goes to see a Hulk Hogan movie for cutting-edge moviemaking, and Mr. Nanny will be no exception."
1,Rotten,"Pitch Perfect 2 is a ""heated mess,"" in spite of a handful of transcendent moments and a lot more just-okay ones."
1,Rotten,This flight should have been permanently delayed due to extraordinarily offensive conditions.
0,Fresh,"This is Jason Reitman's first film since Juno, and it's easy to see why actors and audiences are attracted to his visual eye."
0,Fresh,The computer-generated action in the museum is predictably flawless but cleverly executed to make events far wittier and more exciting than they have any right to be.
0,Fresh,"Not the most eloquent ""outrage doc."""
1,Rotten,The tone of this film is all over the place. The actors feel as if they are in very different movies.
0,Fresh,"Not a film for the masses....the story is laced with sex, drugs and nudity, but it is a capable character study of a group of young friends who could be part of any generation."
0,Fresh,"Plenty of '80s comedies would've just ridden the clown-robbing-a-bank premise for 90 minutes. Instead, 'Quick Change' tosses off its twist twenty minutes in, discovering that the real achievement is not knocking off a bank, but getting out of New York."
0,Fresh,"It's like Folman took several different genres-Hollywood satire, speculative dystopian fiction, family melodrama-and fused them into something amorphous and nebulous."
1,Rotten,"The saving grace that it's actually watchable and funny at times doesn't make its premise any less ridiculous or its execution less formulaic, it just means it's not a complete waste of time"
1,Rotten,"Sin City is one of those films that you know going in is either going to be super-cool or ultra-awful. And in this case, depending on how you look at it, you can't lose or you can't win, because it's both."
0,Fresh,"In his unswerving insistence upon America as Redeemer, Kazan has made a kind of miracle play."
1,Rotten,Everything about Impostor ... is both familiar and profoundly unoriginal.
0,Fresh,Forrest Tucker's swan song moments in The Old Man & the Gun are well tailored for Robert Redford's swan song as an actor. It's a damn good performance that also serves as a fitting curtain call.
1,Rotten,Shooting in New Zealand is only one way in which this film mimics THE LORD OF THE RINGS. But somehow one never really cares much for the four children who generally just do the obvious.
0,Fresh,"This is Bob Downey, simultaneously playing the fool and pulling your leg, and even at his dumbest he's semi-irresistible."
0,Fresh,"Drive Angry is very obviously Nicolas Cage embracing his own ridiculousness, or - in language invented by Bad Lieutenant director Werner Herzog - ""releasing the pigs""."
1,Rotten,"[It] has some lovely music scored by the legendary Howard Shore, but this does little to deafen the dull narrative notes."
1,Rotten,"This is a forgettable picture, with the sad fact that with a little more effort and a veteran's hand, this film could've easily been a more compelling distraction."
0,Fresh,"Objectively I can look at it and see that is a load of sentimental hogwash, but if I relax and just watch it, it sucks me in every time."
1,Rotten,Not too many discernible thrills.
0,Fresh,"Dark Fate is one of the better Terminator films and even though it should be the last one, who the hell knows at this point."
0,Fresh,"[The film highlights] the careful production design, with varied and spectacular European locations, the unbridled use of violence... and the originality of some sequences, such as that of Cirque Du Soleil. [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,[A] gritty police drama addressing the matter of what police work does to the people who do it.
0,Fresh,This is so brilliant that the only real effect of the other versions is to make you want to watch the original again.
1,Rotten,Anti-comedy. Anti-cinema. Anti-life.
0,Fresh,"Black Panther is not only an important movie culturally, but it's also thrilling, dramatic, and gorgeous in a way we don't get to see very often in action movies."
1,Rotten,I thought [Richard] Glatzer's experience might give the film more insight than the usual able-bodied writer and director's view of disability. What I didn't expect from this film was how mild and polite it is about the challenges and loss Alice faces.
0,Fresh,"A stylish, fast-paced let's-get-physical movie"
1,Rotten,This Princess Di biopic swerves past the pitfall of tastelessness only to risk a more perilous roadblock: dullness.
1,Rotten,A sticky piece of cornball that keeps pulling its punches.
1,Rotten,"'Underdog' features some amusing antics by a very cute Beagle in the title role, but it's not quite the treat I expected."
0,Fresh,"If not for the inevitable comparisons to Citizen Kane, How Green Was My Valley might have aged better."
0,Fresh,"Arthur is at its best during a world tour that takes McAvoy, his granddad and their sleigh from Toronto to the Serengeti. But often it seems familiar."
1,Rotten,"Metaphorically, Scott's 'Robin Hood' misses the bulls-eye, but at least hits the edge of the target."
1,Rotten,"Featuring some literally toxic masculinity, Come to Daddy starts out like a nasty drama, ends up as a gruesomely gory, coldly comic revenge thriller - and desperately loses its way somewhere in-between."
0,Fresh,An awkward scene between the artist and a local gallery director highlights Silva's fluency in the rituals of social superiority.
0,Fresh,Jamie Foxx is magnetic as Ray Charles but does not show us enough inner conflict. The film is at its best showing the roots of the character.
0,Fresh,"With a dream cast of the youngest and brightest actors of the day, Cassavetes creates a movie that feels like you're watching an apathetic group of kids riding down a progressively steeper incline in an unmanned vehicle."
0,Fresh,"Reign of Fire, in fact, may be the best Mad Max film to not feature the character of Mad Max."
0,Fresh,"Clever and daring, this high-pitched film never falters. Pulp Fiction is simply masterful. It's also one of the few films this year that bears seeing twice for maximum pleasure."
0,Fresh,"Summer Night is a perfectly sweet film about the hot, hazy nights we've all had and can look back to with adoration and nostalgia."
0,Fresh,"The story is pretty routine, but it's the vivid colors and sense of excitement that comes with the crisp animation that makes it really work."
0,Fresh,"There's no shortage of felicitous lines or interesting performances, yet the movie, like the amusement park of its title, feels constructed from familiar parts."
1,Rotten,So desperately unfunny that you wish someone would sue for false advertising.
1,Rotten,"All this to say, my final takeaway is that, although Steven Shainberg's past work has been good, ""Rupture"" will likely not be added to that list."
0,Fresh,"Screenwriting teachers will tell you that if you don't hook your audience in the first 10 minutes, you've lost them for the full two hours. Director Duncan Jones and writer Ben Ripley have crafted a thriller that does it in only eight."
1,Rotten,"A smug, deliberately convoluted mix tape of Tarantino, the Coen brothers, Guy Ritchie and Hitchcock with (mostly) a cast to die for, Lucky Number Slevin is great fun for, say, 20 minutes."
0,Fresh,"A surprisingly low-key drama with humorous moments, this is an honest and heartfelt piece of work -- a straightforward but genuinely honest look at dealing with adversity."
1,Rotten,Pointless comedy is a waste of a talented comedic cast.
0,Fresh,More entertaining than you might expect.

0,Fresh,A full-blown entertainment of observational humor and relatable poignancy.
0,Fresh,It's hard to imagine what the movie would have been without Michael Keaton in the lead role; his performance actualizes everything the movie aspired to do but failed to achieve.
1,Rotten,It's difficult to connect with any of the characters and feel any sympathy for them.
0,Fresh,The Collector's weaknesses are not enough to destroy an essentially good film. It passes the ultimate critical test in that it compels a fair degree of involvement.
1,Rotten,"beneath the surface are all kinds of questions about power and wealth and the cyclical nature of familial tragedy, and while they break through from time to time, it is never enough to give the film more depth than a TrueTV documentary"
0,Fresh,"Not a good movie, nor a scary one, but you're guaranteed a good time with its inherent stupidity and silliness."
1,Rotten,"Clumsiness follows clumsiness -- the acting, the staging, the details of the plot -- until you reach the point of cool indifference."
0,Fresh,"It seems to me that this timely new film establishes that the current attention given to Pruitt's living situation in Washington, D.C., and pay raises for officials in the EPA, are miniscule compared to the environmental disaster ahead."
0,Fresh,"Fascinating but labored attempt to solve an 80 year old ""murder in paradise"" mystery."
0,Fresh,Henry Fonda's stubborness reminds me of our occupant in the White House with his Iraq policy.
0,Fresh,America Ferrera projects boisterousness belying insecurity. Her unforced bright demeanor eclipses the rest of the movie.
0,Fresh,"You'll admire American Gangster, but it never gets under your skin or sticks in your memory. It's a good film that feels like it could have been great."
1,Rotten,Sample what you want. Doze through the rest.
1,Rotten,"Despite the starry cast, these older versions are nowhere near as engaging as the kids."
1,Rotten,"Director Courtney Solomon's script is a catalogue of the standard Exorcist-style special effects, hammered home by Caine Davidson's musical score, one of the most irritating and nerve-wracking assemblies of noise in movie history."
1,Rotten,"The movie's staleness, bland presentation, and general lack of insight into this particular armpit of globalization are no surprise... but Exporting Raymond captures a few satisfyingly human moments."
0,Fresh,"The question the film asks is, ""Why not?"" Surely life is to be enjoyed? The answer is grimmer than you expect."
0,Fresh,"This is latter-day Disney doing what it does best: simultaneously playing to the kids with big action, slapstick comedy and spectacle while their parents get knowing nods to a more sophisticated adult worldview."
0,Fresh,"Hitchcock's direction is a little flabby, but for sheer enjoyment, there's no better primer on the master's methods."

1,Rotten,There's nothing in this glorified Power Point presentation that stands up to even the most cursory scrutiny.
0,Fresh,"Will Smith began his acting career as a prince, and he remains one of the most engaging, adorable actors on the planet."
1,Rotten,The film's writing is stuck in an ever-tightening spiral of repetition and redundancy before finally stripping away the irony altogether to embrace an understanding of romantic comedy that's about two decades out of date.
0,Fresh,Lars and the Real Girl is poised on the line between earnestness and farce.
0,Fresh,"In a space dominated by massive studio franchises, it is so nice to be able to watch a film that feels like a real work of art, crafted by a person, not a committee."
0,Fresh,"In one of the most unconventional biopics to make its way onto our screens in years, Craig Gillespie's darkly comedic yet incredibly moving ""I, Tonya"" is an avalanche of greatness that sustains its high energy and witty beats."
0,Fresh,Happy to bask in its shameless conventionality - rendering it unlikely to garner the same celebrated longevity of The Full Monty - Cattaneo's film is an irrefutable crowd pleaser.
0,Fresh,"Much more than a mere sideshow in the Star Wars saga, these rebels build on a brilliant legacy."
0,Fresh,"In light of this country's continuing issues with the legacy of the Vietnam War and its veterans, the film packs an earnest and long time in coming punch."
1,Rotten,"Considering the best thing here is a joke about Billy Crystal letting his freak flag fly, it's painfully apparent there's just no rehabilitating this stinker."
0,Fresh,A brilliant and fresh horror film that is both scary and ingenious.
0,Fresh,"Flower is clearly not everyone's idea of a bouquet, but it's willing to take chances -- and push buttons. It's a film that reflects our times, even if it makes us uncomfortable to acknowledge it."
1,Rotten,A psychotic Sophie's Choice. Much more a gruesome tale of revenge than it is a suspense thriller along the lines of Harris' earlier Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs.
0,Fresh,"It hasn't got the story to quite match the spectacle, but it's another exciting and witty entry in the Marvel cinematic canon."
1,Rotten,One can only wonder if Steve Koren's screenplay is in part inspired by Sandler's real-life attempt as a producer to pull Pacino into this wreck.
1,Rotten,The first train wreck of 2014 is a labor of incompetence not even Hercules' strength can overcome.
0,Fresh,"The film is both traditional and modern: austere in its engagement with history, and insistent in its showy action beats."
0,Fresh,"[T]here's some remarkable psychological insight in this scary little movie. Which isn't to say that it isn't all utter nonsense, either..."
0,Fresh,"An intriguing study of how information spreads, and a sober meditation on human relationships."
0,Fresh,It may not match the original classic but the fast-paced story holds its own.
1,Rotten,"It's exhausting, yet emotionally unengaging."
0,Fresh,"If the script never rises above the sitcom level, at least the lines are delivered by people who are so good they almost seem like wit."
1,Rotten,The endless miscalculations on the filmmakers' parts have turned Scooby-Doo into even more of a disaster than anyone could have imagined.

0,Fresh,"Though not entirely successful, Lee's adaptation certainly has balls."
0,Fresh,"Shyamalan finds freshness in familiar horror tropes. After some big budget misfires, it's great to see him go back to his smaller, scarier roots."
1,Rotten,It is nonsense that bores me for an hour and a half without any intention of abandoning the showy effectism and the routine plot full of clichés of all kinds in order to move down the easier lane. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Constructed with passion, insight and an appreciation for healthy skepticism ... a superior documentary"
0,Fresh,One might divide the film into three parts: One third -- Cook's Tour; One third -- precise melodramatic hooey; and one blessed third -- Mesers Sabu and Desmond Tester. The latter division... is what makes Drums something that you can't beat (pun).
1,Rotten,This film is like watching the actual game played by someone with slow reactions. That's not much of a spectator sport.
0,Fresh,by turns funny and frightening... a perfect hybridisation of familiar found footage tropes and transgressive Bobcattery.
0,Fresh,"Vince can't sell his robot to the police because -- get this -- it has too many guns. Bring that bad boy to America, dude. We'll have it inside day care centers in a week."

0,Fresh,Aja rejects the victim mentality of horror for the past ten years and crafts a legit throwback to the classic slasher doubling as Morality Play. Well done.
0,Fresh,"Osder's technique makes this a film that's impossible to keep your eyes off of, and makes for one of the most effective documentaries to come out this year."
0,Fresh,A little bit of a letdown for a film from an exciting new voice that's funny and raunchy.
0,Fresh,"It's very much a universal portrait of human willfulness, perhaps the finest since Charles Stone III's Mr. 3000, starring Bernie Mac."
0,Fresh,"Gorgeously animated, with rich color scapes and detailed mise-en-scne, Goro Miyazaki's sophomore outing incorporates lovely, introspective imagery of, say, a cloud passing in front of the moon or smokestacks shot at a steep angle."
1,Rotten,Sends shivers down my spine. And not the good kind.
0,Fresh,"Effervescent and satisfying, a crowd pleaser that does not condescend."
1,Rotten,"The film fails to entertain in the conventional sense of the term, and often feels like a documentary."

0,Fresh,"The film celebrates stupidity and would likely have caused an international incident if Canadians weren't so nice, but it essentially lives up to its premise, once in a while coming up with a gag that is halfway funny."
0,Fresh,"In a season full of movies about families and tragedy, this is the class of the bunch."
0,Fresh,"Dylan's tour was a jape, and so is this relentlessly entertaining film."
1,Rotten,"The contrivances pile up more quickly than snowfall in a Buffalo winter, and the ending is so lame that it provoked guffaws from theater-goers attending the screening along with me."
0,Fresh,"A delectable little treat that's sunny, funny, and far more intelligent than you'd expect."
0,Fresh,"It's a balanced and honest look at young sexuality, and thankfully never didactic in its approach."
0,Fresh,"Freeman, a thinking man's actor, lets us into Mandela's head without having to explain what he's got on his mind."
0,Fresh,"I'd still urge those curious about Snowden and what he did to watch Citizenfour and read The Guardian's striking reporting on his massive disclosure. But as a straightforward, accessible overview, Snowden sturdily does its part for the cause."
0,Fresh,This is a film that finds hope and wonder and joy in a world that can be harsh and unfair and director Claude Barras acknowledges both.
0,Fresh,"The basic outline of Rock's script is standard romcom...but Rock uses it to examine show biz, celebrity, addiction, discrimination and family in painfully funny fashion. It's Rock's hip hop homage to Woody Allen and his own stand up roots."
0,Fresh,"A surprisingly sweet story about a pair of Rhode Island Catholic schoolboys, played with knockabout charm by Alex Maizus and Dylan Hartigan."
1,Rotten,"Illuminating as it might be for fans and disciples of Lennon, Sam Taylor-Wood's bio-pic does get a bit corny..."
0,Fresh,"Motel Hell is a rather well-executed dark comedy that plays it fairly straight, much thanks to the outstanding performances from Calhoun & Parsons who give the film a nice sense of gravity against the film's more cartoonish supporting characters."
1,Rotten,"A Sound of Thunder is worth noting, if only as a real contender for worst movie of the year."
0,Fresh,The adventure will not fully capture your heart but holds enough charm for one to go down the rabbit hole with this lot.
1,Rotten,"This is bargain-basement schmaltz, too blandly folksy even for Sundance. Sheer toothiness can't elevate drab material."
0,Fresh,This brings much-needed new life to a popular cinematic landscape overcrowded with ageing franchises and endless reboots.
1,Rotten,"For every female who's ever been infatuated with Tom Cruise... here's your love letter. Did this go wrong in the editing room, or was it always this bad of an idea?"
0,Fresh,...by far the most formally intriguing installment in the franchise.
0,Fresh,There's a better movie rattling around somewhere that never fully forms.
1,Rotten,"Despite the complicated trappings -- a film within a film within a film, shot both on film and video -- Full Frontal is mostly a pedestrian look at sex, race, and desperation in the movie business."
1,Rotten,Cutesy and cloying.
0,Fresh,A truly great western.
0,Fresh,"An escapist yarn anti-escapist in subtext, it posits a subversive movie fantasy: dissidence as heroic, even patriotic in search of an ideal, less small minded country."
1,Rotten,"There's at least one idea out there for a thoughtful, provocative movie on the subject of human cloning. Unfortunately, Godsend isn't it."
1,Rotten,"What starts out as a perky musical, slides downward into a morass of misplaced romantic desires over the course of four decades."
1,Rotten,"The summer of 1989 was the summer of Batman, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lethal Weapon 2 and several other sizable hits, so who in their right mind wanted to waste time and money on a generic Stallone prison flick?"
1,Rotten,It's a shame that Disney and Pixar aren't in the 'classic-making' business anymore; just the 'distraction-making' business.
0,Fresh,"It produces a rare match made for mother/daughter movie heaven, and Gerwig and her gifted girls just about get us there."
0,Fresh,"A gay romantic comedy, witty and charming enough to stand up to any boy-meets-girl date flick in the megaplexes."
0,Fresh,"... von Trier has finally written troubled women who aren't completely defined by their neuroses. ""Melancholia"" is a welcome surprise."
1,Rotten,"Less interested in sexual power dynamics than in lassoing this guy into what the movie perceives as ""normalcy."""
0,Fresh,"The Spierigs allow the plethora of heady ideas to surface naturally - with the occasional, not terribly subtle shout-outs to Mobius strips and the chicken-or-the-egg question, that is."
0,Fresh,"Chastain has never gone this loose cannon before, and you can sense a private thrill at not caring how precise she is, at going wild and getting close to embarrassing herself."
1,Rotten,The septuagenarian filmmaker does great supporting work in a film that's otherwise long on atmosphere but short on specifics...
1,Rotten,"The moral of the story is that looks don't matter. But in animation, looks do matter, and even a sweet romance and fun tunes cannot overcome the clunkiness of its design."
1,Rotten,"Since Jay Lee desperately wants to be in on the joke, the movie isn't exactly camp, but since it's actually terrible, it isn't a parody either."
1,Rotten,Few performances are hardy enough both to blossom in the dark intimacy of live theater and bloom under the glaring eye of a movie camera. Ghostlight is not the exception.
1,Rotten,"It's rare that a movie with such a promising first half completely falls apart in the second - when the Oscar winner shows up. Portman's performance is a big, big swing - and a huge miss."
0,Fresh,The Master is a film about obedience and forming an identity through subservience.
0,Fresh,"I can't say Home is the groundbreaking artistic masterpiece of storytelling we all hoped it would be, but I also disagree with idea that every new thing starring a person of color has to be spectacular and perfect."
1,Rotten,"Nonetheless, Labor Day, adapted from Joyce Maynard's novel, gets hamstrung by having the wrong character acting as our voice-over guide into this world."
1,Rotten,"As a movie, this is good TV."
0,Fresh,I don't know if anyone can better direct the kind of swords-and-horses action on display here.
0,Fresh,The chemistry between the two leads is remarkable.
0,Fresh,It does deliver a forceful message: the fight for the young Russians' hearts and minds is far from over.
0,Fresh,So deep-felt a movie about rage and retribution that will stick with you like a bad dream.
0,Fresh,"No present-day actor celebrates the working class like Hoffman, and he captures the ordinary joys and heartache of Jack, Connie, Clyde and Lucy with feeling and respect."
1,Rotten,"While Caine is, without any doubt, absolutely the best thing in this Sleuth, as the film is entirely without purpose, so is his performance."
0,Fresh,"The story, from beginning to end, is enthralling, mainly due to the anchoring performances by Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie."
1,Rotten,"""San Andreas"" is a disaster - literally."
1,Rotten,"Maybe I'm missing the joke. Hell, maybe I'm the punch line, since I couldn't find any good ones in this borderline unwatchable motion picture."
0,Fresh,"""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is a penultimate chapter without a real ending, but it's also a thrilling ride full of potent emotions, new characters and major twists of fate, built around another commanding star performance."
1,Rotten,Remains a bore for much of its running time.
0,Fresh,"Barantini's Villain is a genre film but a rather superior, well-made one that manipulates your sympathies."
0,Fresh,[A] complete triumph...
0,Fresh,"Miller's film is a triumph. Uniformly well acted, it boasts a psychologically knowing script, clearly written by a smart, assertive human being rather than a software programme. As for the luminous Wright Penn, awards season beckons."
0,Fresh,An edgy romantic dramedy that suits our anxious times.
0,Fresh,"Although the set-up strains the audience's disbelief, the mournful style -- complete with a downbeat soundtrack reminiscent of triphop crooners Portishead -- and meandering pace give this tale an unusual, near surreal, edge."
0,Fresh,...you'd need a particularly hard heart not to be moved by their story.
0,Fresh,Whitaker's incendiary and incandescent performance dominates this movie as much as Helen Mirren's performance defines The Queen.
0,Fresh,The film -- although slight -- works wonderfully.
0,Fresh,Phoenix and Reilly make a dream double act.
0,Fresh,"The rolling of the end credits acts like a finger-snap, after which I suggest you return to your life without giving what's transpired much further though. Easy to watch; easy to dismiss."
0,Fresh,"The first great video game movie may still elude audiences, but Sonic the Hedgehog is nevertheless an encouraging sprint in the right direction."
1,Rotten,"Kurzel and three screenwriters have figured out a way to make ""Macbeth"" boring. Now that they proved it can be done, no one need ever do it again."
0,Fresh,"This one continues the trend of [Woody Allen] films that look great, but say little that is fresh."
0,Fresh,The actresses make certain you understand their motivations and quirks. It helps Bonneville step away from Lifetime Television treacle into something palatable. Perhaps even charming.
1,Rotten,"Earns points for sheer audacity, but audacity isn't enough."
0,Fresh,"The Outrageous Sophie Tucker is rich with such tall tales and juicy nuggets, befitting a larger-than-life icon."
0,Fresh,"Japan's definitive leading man, Toshiro Mifune, wields wits that are even deadlier than his Katana. Funny, clever, and never a dull moment."
0,Fresh,"A perfectly serviceable entry in the cinematic superhero sweepstakes, Thor provides viewers with a good time as long as they're not taking notes and comparing it to other high-profile Marvel properties."
1,Rotten,Napoleon and his pals aren't the heroes of a Bruce Springsteen song who get up every morning and go to work each day. They're knuckleheads.
1,Rotten,Like a zombie version of his previous movies %u2013 feeding off what came before and just not quite all there.
1,Rotten,"By the time Carrie's famous blood-splattering climax strangely twists and turns toward a final curtain, there even might be room for a sequel. But I doubt it."
0,Fresh,"ustralian-born singer/songwriter Nick Cave pens his second film (after ""Ghosts ... Of The Civil Dead"") and generates a prescient allegory about imperialism."
0,Fresh,The shared energy created by audience and performer that is so restorative to Garland is where the movie finds life.
0,Fresh,"Though 2006 might not seem too far removed from our present, in terms of LGBTQ visibility the distance between then and now is considerable. ""Adam"" reminds us how much, thankfully, society has slowly changed and yet how far we still are from real change."
1,Rotten,"To be honest, I just don't know how your kids will react to this film; you, however, might want to bring something to read."
0,Fresh,The name may not be instantly recognizable but Harry Nilsson (who died of cancer in 1994) was once the golden boy of American pop music.
0,Fresh,"In La Vie en Rose, Marion Cotillard has the role of a lifetime. And she relishes it."
0,Fresh,"In the great Joaquin debate -- is he crazy like a loon, or like a fox? -- the smart Hollywood money is on fox."
0,Fresh,"Amid the antics, Paddington 2 still manages to be a sweet, moving tale about what families are willing to do for one another."
0,Fresh,"Manhattan is not just Woody Allen's dream movie. Wistful as it is witty, it's his dream of the movies."
1,Rotten,Weird combination of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and a Holocaust drama is (almost) saved by Jeff Goldblum's commanding lead performance.
0,Fresh,"I wanted [Buddy and Abby] to become lovers, which means they sold me on themselves."
1,Rotten,"If this movie was a person, it would be a dudebro and call itself woke."
0,Fresh,"You won't find two finer performances in recent times than those by Mullan and Colman, who in a perfect world would each have received Oscar nominations this week."
0,Fresh,"This is a period film like no other, a slow but utterly hypnotic tale of an Irish youth whose adventures and misfortunes take in the Seven Years' War, the gambling clubs of Europe and marriage into the English aristocracy."
1,Rotten,"The vibrant Los Angeles backdrop and colorful characters make for some great film, but Rules Don't Apply comes with lots of turbulence and a bumpy landing."
1,Rotten,"The story's a wash ... with a twist that won't surprise, and Patrick Fischler's role as the creepy FBI agent is too obvious a puzzle piece."
0,Fresh,"The mother-daughter relationship is central here, as we watch two very different women come to terms with who they are and who they are desperate to become. This juxtaposition was one of the most profound aspects Jinn."
0,Fresh,"Some will feel privileged to see human drama and an aspect of life not often seen on the movie screen. Others will feel haunted by it and wish they never saw it. For sure, few will leave the film unaffected."
1,Rotten,Seed of Chucky doesn't even rise to the straight-to-video standards of shlock horror
1,Rotten,[Linklater] can't find a suitable form for Maria Semple's patchwork best seller...
1,Rotten,"[tries to be tricky, but] at the end of the day it is still torture porn."
1,Rotten,"On Stranger Tides has the faint stink of a phoned-in cash grab, and box office receipts will likely confirm fears that this is not the last we've heard from Jack Sparrow and company."
0,Fresh,An entertaining film focused on the transforming power of music. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,Not bad but also so frivolous that there's nothing to grab onto and take away from it all. Leatherheads is a good-looking but misguided waste of time and effort.
1,Rotten,"It's ""Groundhog Day"" except it features Tom Cruise instead of Bill Murray, which can't make it better."
1,Rotten,"Noxious, reactionary and unashamedly pro-British to a startling degree."
1,Rotten,"Sorry, I didn't order this."
1,Rotten,"[Fonda] takes a trip with no retribution at all: no death, no disillusionment, but much bikinied girls on sea shores, swirling psychedelia, and mumbling of 'Wow!' by the obligatory Dennis Hopper in the land of a thousand visual clichés."
1,Rotten,"If Abrams had stuck with the kids and cut way back on all the sci-fi hoo-ha, his film might have stood a fighting chance of being charming. Big is not always better, even when it comes to fantasies."
0,Fresh,This engrossing new film about a long-forgotten murder that launched the Beat Generation kicks off with a toast from the pillow lips of Lucien Carr...
1,Rotten,"For nearly its entire length, the movie comes off as condescending, particularly about small towns."
1,Rotten,"Five minutes into this formulaic flick, you'll think you collaborated on the screenplay."
1,Rotten,"Rather than diving into the maelstrom of conflicted emotions [the film] postpones the big reveal until the last few minutes, putting most of [its] energy into cheap suspense."
0,Fresh,"Graced with Nair's loving direction, Witherspoon's radiance and that great cast, it is a treat, if somewhat less so than the novel."
1,Rotten,"Oh, Lin Shaye. These movies don't deserve you."
0,Fresh,What a fine film Insomnia is. Wonderfully good.
1,Rotten,Disengaged silly spoof of those '70s disaster movies.
1,Rotten,Sad to say that may be the script's greatest problem: the real story involves a lot of legal wrangling that isn't terribly cinematic.
1,Rotten,"A mixed bag as a comedy, with some genuine moments of emotional power but far too many awkward and irritating scenes."
1,Rotten,"If you actually are a fan of Shrek, nothing I say will convince you to skip it (Captain Obvious sitting 2 rows back laughed at jokes they would have cut from Leave it to Beaver for being too corny) but heed my warning."
0,Fresh,"The whole thing is a zippy, frenetic and surprisingly meta commentary on the comic-book industry - but it also has a heart, a fabulous voice cast, and comes equipped with some of the sharpest punchlines of the year."
0,Fresh,Avengers: Endgame culminates the MCU with a swan song that celebrates its rich history and provides a heartfelt conclusion 22 films in the making.
1,Rotten,"In spite of narrative missteps that negate the possibility of an empathetic protagonist, ""In My Country"" does viably introduce the African principle of ""Ubuntu"" whereby evil transgressions are absolved rather than revenged."
1,Rotten,"Jokes are predictable, cheap and far too easy, as with many films of the spoof sub-genre."
1,Rotten,"The pieces for a competent action drama are there, but they never come together."
0,Fresh,"From the first shot to the last, you feel that tremendous security you get when you are sure that the filmmaker is in total control of his material."
1,Rotten,"Nichols and Sorkin take the easy way out, promoting the personal tale of the roguish Wilson, rather than establishing a real socio-political context within which something insightful might have emerged"
0,Fresh,"A slick, plot-driven thriller about the nasty underside of the spy game that has a lot going for it, and a few bad things that don't spoil the ride."
0,Fresh,Both [Michael Sheen and Helen Mirren] understand the prickly push-and-pull that defines the fight -- the Gray Monarch v. the Great Modernizer -- and give quiet gravitas to the polite but firm standoffs.
1,Rotten,A historical romance that has little value either historically or romantically.
0,Fresh,"Cameron`s superb action direction and stunning visual effects -- + Schwarzenegger`s ultimately endearing (yes, endearing) performance -- will blast every other summer film to kingdom come."
0,Fresh,Performances are aces top to bottom.
0,Fresh,"Laughton's only film makes up, in atmospherics and its horribly righteous wrongdoer, for lapses into talkiness and staginess. There are the moody, often German Expressionist shots and that twinkling gleam to the word-crafty, preaching predator's malice."
0,Fresh,"The lead performances are commendable, there's a genial chemistry between the three male friends and most of the jokes work."
1,Rotten,Looks cheesy much of the time and smells cheesy -- as in Limburger -- all of the time.
1,Rotten,"The problem is that for most of the running time, How Do You Know meanders and has a hard time finding the right tone, lurching forward from one scene to the next."
0,Fresh,"There's never been a Western like this, but dang if every bizarre thing in it doesn't seem historically probable."
0,Fresh,Die-hard fans insist no new 'Jurassic' movie could ever touch the original. Oh yeah? Come again? 'Jurassic World' just completely blew the doors off 'Jurassic Park.'
1,Rotten,"Salt could have been a pretty good brain-dead summer popcorn thriller, but director Phillip Noyce and star Angelina Jolie lend it too much weight without providing any depth."
1,Rotten,"It's The Matrix's less-refined cousin, the one that didn't pay full attention in cool school."
0,Fresh,Thank goodness that even the Santas have a mom to help them sort out their turmoils.
0,Fresh,"The movie sets up a weird dynamic: While we absolutely root for the Fox women in their legal action, we can't quite forget that they've made a fortune by serving up Ailes' incendiary views for years."
0,Fresh,"You know not to expect something deep and meaningful when a movie stars Stallone and Schwarzenegger, and indeed this is pretty much what we expect: a slick thriller that's utterly preposterous but not quite stupid."
0,Fresh,An entertaining and feisty Western from the Coen Brothers propelled by an incredibly fetching performance by Hailee Steinfeld as a wise beyond her years teenager with indomitable will-power.
0,Fresh,Doesn't produce belly laughs so much as steady smiles of recognition over how accurately it's nailing its target.
1,Rotten,"Fowler's Sonic is what it is: family fun, which in the U.S.-Pixar and Into the Spiderverse notwithstanding-still tends to mean only-sort-of fun and adamantly not-smart."
0,Fresh,A three-hander situated comfortably between Venus and Amour on the Euro-codger fun-time spectrum.
1,Rotten,[A] measly little picture.
0,Fresh,"This fascinating documentary shows how far government will go to throttle opposition, but also how, sometimes, you can fight the establishment and win."
0,Fresh,It works best when it treats [the zombies] more as an impediment to be overcome by the sheer Britishness of the characters.
0,Fresh,"A must-see for Nicholson's mesmerizing performance, which would probably hold interest even if the sound were turned off."
1,Rotten,Ready Player One is a tender tribute to gamers from a filmmaker who doesn't really appear to understand or empathise with them.
0,Fresh,"If nothing else, this is a rare case in which a director's feature debut doubles as his greatest-hits album."
0,Fresh,"Lulu Wang is a triumph of the will... [as] The Farewell invites, delivers, cultural appreciation."
1,Rotten,"The movie is the textbook definition of ""preaching to the choir,"" [going] through the holy motions and playing it incredibly safe."
0,Fresh,"It opens at fever pitch and then starts soaring -- into genetic fantasy, into a precognitive dream of delirium and delight."
0,Fresh,"A down and dirty action adventure, and the best escapist entertainment around. Check your brain at the door for non-stop rowdy, riotous and raucous fun."
0,Fresh,"Deepa Mehta deserves kudos for directing the magisterial Midnight's Children, although it's a shame screenwriter Salman Rushdie wasn't more ruthless with his own novel."
1,Rotten,"Not without its charms, but an incredibly overlong sequel that often feels like a chain of video game mini-quests."
0,Fresh,"Action-fortified, touching and entertaining from its beguiling beginning to its dreamy conclusion."
1,Rotten,"In one of the most generous pieces of movie casting ever, travel writer Bill Bryson is portrayed by Robert Redford in this lazy, feather-light adaptation of his book about walking the Appalachian Trail."
0,Fresh,Shanghai Noon is the movie Wild Wild West tried to be last summer.
0,Fresh,"Walking into Two Weeks Notice at the end of a hectic day, week, month and year, I wanted it to be a typical romantic comedy starring those two lovable people, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. And it was."
0,Fresh,"Captain America is not high art, but it is so unabashedly fun -- and such well-made fun -- that it is hard to not like and admire it for so steadfastly being what it is."
0,Fresh,The definitive version of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
1,Rotten,"The movie is so devoted to offering a clever course-correction of the Tarzan myth, while still staying true to that myth, that it overlooks its own impossibility."
0,Fresh,"Having seen Before Sunset twice, and Before Sunrise again in between, I can't say which film is better. Both seem to fulfill an ambition Jean-Luc Godard expressed in the 60s -- to achieve 'the definitive by chance.'"
0,Fresh,"Elstree 1976 mostly succeeds in its attempt to shed light on the people behind the makeup and masks. Here there is humility and jealousy, gratitude and bemusement, eloquently and touchingly recounted."
0,Fresh,"A little long, but still entertaining, installment in the popular franchise."
0,Fresh,Gregg Hale and Eduardo Sánchez's A Ride in the Park puts a thoroughly innovative spin on the zombie genre and immediately establishes itself as a highlight within the entire series.
0,Fresh,"Illuminating, heartbreaking and alarming."
0,Fresh,"Hot, steamy, full-blown nihilistic filmmaking. A template for erotic violence."
1,Rotten,The massively frustrating 21 Years: Richard Linklater is a perfect example of the difference between a great subject and a great (or even a good) documentary.
0,Fresh,"Pegg and Wright's movies laugh, bleed and explode in the face of maturity, even as they begrudgingly recognize the virtue of it."
1,Rotten,Quaintly entertaining little horror chestnut...if you're into old-fashioned Rasputin-lite rehashes and late 70's decor.
1,Rotten,"Never achieves the promise offered by a likable family, believably spooky townies and rich atmospherics."
0,Fresh,"A substantial and entertaining tale whose portrait of learning and intelligence, family and friendship, is in stark contrast to the typical Hollywood fare."
0,Fresh,Alien Covenant tries to recreate the first two films but gets lost in its own laziness.
1,Rotten,Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is as insufferable as its title.
0,Fresh,"'The Village' is among Shyamalan's salvageable films, in which he uses ignorance and superstition to keep a group of people in the woods away from evil creatures. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,Chan looks as if he's having fun and it rubs off.
1,Rotten,"Either you buy their Vaseline-lensed visions of the hereafter, or you watch in stony silence, as I did, wondering why there's no one to care about."
0,Fresh,"It's a film that, in its own peculiar way, forces viewers to question their values and ask themselves how much they're willing to sacrifice for a functioning society, and how much is too much."
0,Fresh,It's a quietly devastating work that follows an unpredictable and touching path that teaches us a great deal about grieving and learning to live again.
0,Fresh,A joyous experience.
0,Fresh,"Aja and company teach us the skills to endure in the face of death, but also that living in Florida isn't for the faint of heart."
1,Rotten,"It's decently acted and decently made. At the same time, though, there's nothing particularly exceptional going on here."
0,Fresh,"The film's strange way of meandering off its original topic is never resolved, but even with its deficiencies The Arbor is always intelligent cinema."
0,Fresh,"Summerland has little you haven't seen before, but the genuine sentiment drives the heart of this likeably imperfect project."
0,Fresh,...in Armadillo there are few discussions of abstract concepts like justice or freedom-the focus is much more on day-to-day work.
1,Rotten,Jason Reitman forgot the tapioca.
0,Fresh,"I like movies about solving problems, and Damon gives a skillful performance, and Scott's ability to put you in the middle of a howling Martian gale is impressive. But man, The Martian is corny."
0,Fresh,Diane Lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in Unfaithful.
0,Fresh,Is it better than the stage version? Not necessarily. But this is a faithful rendition that should succeed in bringing a delightful old-fashioned crowd-pleaser to a new audience.
1,Rotten,"Repo Men is basically a soulless slasher flick, and one that demeans its gifted performers."
0,Fresh,"Those seeing the heartfelt ""Five Feet Apart"" may laugh, they may cry, and they might even swoon, sometimes all at the same time."
0,Fresh,Much of this is majestic. But a thought kept fidgeting in my head. Do we need quite so many dead white males singing the tragedies and trials of the black experience?
0,Fresh,"In the end, the power of Shoplifters is cumulative and unexpected. As with Osamu's tricks, legal and otherwise, it's only afterwards that you realize what has happened."
0,Fresh,A mix of the fascinating and the frustrating...
0,Fresh,It's always risky to make a film that shifts and reformulates what it is and what the audience should derive from it straight through the final shot.
1,Rotten,Apted ... brings nothing fresh to the formula besides the minor innovation of dropping an action heroine into a male-dominated field.
0,Fresh,Fans won't be disappointed in Thor: Ragnorak.
1,Rotten,"Fueled by testosterone, it's a wannabe action-comedy caper that turns out to be neither."
1,Rotten,"Directed with the flat artlessness of a lower-rung Masterpiece Theater entry, pulling heartstrings with Igor Khoroshev's lugubrious score and scripted with banal bromides insulting to its subject matter."
0,Fresh,"A complete experience, merging an offering of love and empathy with the sharpness of large-scale filmmaking, presented in a way few could pull off like Cuaron."
0,Fresh,"Movies about doubles are, almost by definition, creepy, but Villeneuve, not to be outdone, piles on the weirdness."
0,Fresh,A film that will make you want to watch it again and again and again.
1,Rotten,"Attal doesn't illuminate Vincent's motives for straying, and unwisely suggests Vincent's philandering and Gabrielle's daydreaming are somehow morally equivalent."
0,Fresh,It is doubtful if the wistful fantasy has ever been done with such charm and beauty as fills the Walt Disney version of James M. Barrie's fanciful play.
0,Fresh,All of the drama of GWTW is successfully combined with dazzling production values.
0,Fresh,A movie was inevitable. Maybe we're lucky Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks were there to direct and star in the film.
1,Rotten,I can't help but think it's a film that would disappoint Apocalypse. We all know what happens when Apocalypse gets disappointed.
1,Rotten,"﻿Time passes, hope sinks and a theme emerges, unfortunately. Men in Black II shows that only two kinds of women exist on other planets: shining saints and snaky monsters."
0,Fresh,"Pixar has set a high bar for films about anthropomorphized critters, inanimate objects, artificial intelligences and abstract concepts, too high for a harmless but only marginally clever time-filler like Zootopia to fully hurdle."
0,Fresh,"There is nothing about Into the Blue that is going to arouse anything above the waistline, but director Stockwell makes a fair show of it."
0,Fresh,"An utterly delightful, wonderfully inventive and frequently hilarious silent comedy that stands as a joyous, knowing tribute to classic silent cinema and features a trio of terrific performances from Jean Dujardin, Brnice Bejo and Uggy the dog."
0,Fresh,"Stories of injustice have been told before, but rarely have they been told with such artistry. This is a film that lingers."
0,Fresh,"Funny, creative, and the refreshing heist movie of its genre since ""Ant-Man"", ""Logan Lucky"" is an entertaining romp from beginning to end."
1,Rotten,There isn't one conservationist idea in the tamely correct Mononoke that the adult audience didn't know already.
1,Rotten,"For all its flaws, what's most disappointing is that Dark Phoenix was the final chance for the Fox X-verse to really flex its muscles."
1,Rotten,Clint Eastwood's revisionism painting America in a bad light and turning Imperial Japan's barbaric soldiers into boon chaps won't change the facts.
1,Rotten,"We wish this left a sour taste in the mouth, instead it leaves nothing."
1,Rotten,Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous attempts to do this and has its moments before it succumbs to complete banality.
0,Fresh,"With its portentous narration and bike-riding/book writing aesthetic, this third feature from Alex Ross Perry is a masterclass in tarnished twee."
1,Rotten,"School's out, schlock's in - no lessons here."
1,Rotten,"Suffering from fewer of the stunts that made the original film a sensation and an afterthought of a script, District 13: Ultimatum is an auto-pilot shell of its sire."
1,Rotten,"A serious social drama without insight, a unique point of view or, seemingly, much of an understanding of its own issues."
0,Fresh,"Hardy does sterling work in evoking the shifting balance of self-loathing [and] pride in doing the right thing... As an exercise in pure character building, it's a great one."
1,Rotten,"As a joke, Catfight is a punch line with a really shaky setup."
1,Rotten,"Clever, but not clever enough to make its central conceit work."
1,Rotten,"If I wanted the story read to me, I would have bought the book on tape."
0,Fresh,A soul-satisfying film about one young woman's rite of initiation into adulthood.
0,Fresh,"Delicate psychological insight, a strong aesthetic signature and two affecting, restrained performances by Alexandra Borbély and Géza Morcsányi overcome any familiarity, as well as occasional hints of preciousness."
1,Rotten,Slightly less awful than most of Van Damme's efforts.
1,Rotten,The film's message is lost amid too many plot contrivances.
0,Fresh,A haunting story of a committed band of eco-terrorists who want to pay back corporate CEOs for their crimes against humanity and the environment.

1,Rotten,What the director can’t do is make either of Val Kilmer’s two personas interesting or worth caring about.
0,Fresh,"Tackles the issue of sex slavery, but does so in a way that never feels too clumsy or overarching. Instead, it's a character study with thriller elements; it exposes you to a horrible underworld without ever beating you over the head with it."
1,Rotten,"While enjoyable in parts, its episodic pacing lets down the real-life story of a bold and remarkable woman."
0,Fresh,"In a time when even the most accomplished genre movies have the fingerprints of focus group-happy execs all over them, the relatively unmitigated quirk of Dark Shadows is worth celebrating."
0,Fresh,"It's not difficult to project that Crano's charming anti-heros, in later life, will be swindling vulnerable little old ladies out of their homes and nest eggs."

0,Fresh,[Maddin]'s basically playing at being a Busby Berkeley for the chronically depressed and/or cheerfully repressed.
1,Rotten,"When it isn't killing off its characters one by one during a cave-diving expedition gone wrong, ""Sanctum"" resembles a Hemingway short story without the story part. Or an episode of ""Flipper"" without the dolphin."

0,Fresh,"It is so very well made that one can only wish there were a little more to it than the fleshy mechanics of trauma. It is a film to admire greatly, but not truly enjoy - much like Brandon's attitude to the call girl."
0,Fresh,"Though ""Becoming Astrid"" is unflinching in its depictions of Astrid's pain, it does not wallow. A shallower story would be rife with villains, but there are none here."
1,Rotten,"A handsomely made but tonally uncertain film; it's unsure whether to be an old-fashioned inspirational heartwarmer, or a paranoid prose-poem about ruined lives on the city's dangerous margins."

1,Rotten,"A slick, superficial attempt to define the 20th century's quintessential enigmatic personality by giving us the sort of commercialized phoniness that Salinger not only detested, but drove him into a decades-long seclusion in the New Hampshire woods."

0,Fresh,Reiner keeps everything moving while letting Harmon do the heavy lifting as his young co-stars sprinkle the chuckles around.
1,Rotten,What if director Joseph Ruben didn't resort to B-movie suspense tricks? What if the fine cast wasn't saddled with a shamelessly contrived script by Wesley Strick and Bruce Robinson?

0,Fresh,"Riley builds on the history of satirical cinema to tell a sharply contemporary fable that critiques the related inequities of race, class and unionised labour."
0,Fresh,"Taken on its own delightfully twisted terms, it is bold and uncompromising. It knows its audience, and delivers a fable for the ages, deliciously uncensored."
0,Fresh,"Blitz's dialogue is often clever, and the young cast members impress, particularly relative newcomers Thompson and Kendrick."
1,Rotten,"In spite of its human rights background story and the presence of actor Sean Penn, The Gunman unspools as little more than a by-the-numbers action thriller."

1,Rotten,"The antiquated remake of ""Endless Love"" is enough to end relationships. A re-imagining of the 1981 Brooke Shields vehicle, which was pretty bad on its own accord, is a painfully endless stream of romance clichés with few redeeming qualities."

1,Rotten,"Boy, this is bad. And I mean walk-out-of-the-cinema bad. So awful, in fact, that its dullness, pomposity and sheer gloominess are among the film's better points."
1,Rotten,"Featuring interviews with such luminaries as Tim Burton, John Lasseter, Don Bluth, Michael Eisner, the late Howard Ashman, the irascible Roy Disney and others, the film is a self-congratulatory dud."

1,Rotten,"The gimmicky, gory thriller wears out its welcome once the film's three co-writers makes some ridiculous narrative choices that transform The Perfection from a strange, sick and campy revenge flick into something more lowbrow and less entertaining."
1,Rotten,"That unhinged, hallucinatory spirit is what Kurzel taps into visually... realism clashing with fantasy to the point where the landscape feels more Mordor than the bush outside Melbourne... It's a lot. A little too much for me."
1,Rotten,"It's hard to fault the cheesy cheeriness at work here, but this should not in any sense be confused with a great film, or even a good one from the adult point of view, and they should consider themselves warned when it come to sitting through it"

0,Fresh,"This dizzy, delirious jukebox musical has the energy and visual dynamism to truly reflect the outlandish aesthetic and performance style of its subject."
1,Rotten,"Perhaps the biggest slight against ""Proud Mary"" is that nothing happens. It's an action movie without action. It's a drama without real drama. In short, it's a complete bore."
0,Fresh,"Some with no memory of being swept away almost forty years ago will follow strong new heroes and villains. For those old enough now and young enough then to have childhoods consumed by this stuff, it's a satisfying new turn in a near life-long tale."
1,Rotten,This one is best seen by film buffs and blindly devoted Woody Allen fans who will accept even his castigation. The rest of us can hope he cheers up soon.
1,Rotten,"There's a decent story trapped somewhere inside that's just waiting to get out, but Tully sadly misses the mark."
0,Fresh,If it flukes a wide release and finds an audience it could mark the beginnings of a sensibility revolution in American humor.
0,Fresh,Funny? Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Flattering? Not in the slightest. Anyone who wants to be in the Jordan Belfort business after watching Wolf must have rocks in their head.
1,Rotten,"A single act of heroism can truly transform a life, but that action does not necessarily make for a transformative motion picture."
0,Fresh,Brando's triumph and fascination is less that of an actor of parts than of a star galaxy of myths.
0,Fresh,"A sense of impending doom about ""Blindspotting,"" a unique, stylish and definitely R-rated drama from a pair of longtime friends that works in dramatic tone changes, guiding the audience towards a provocative finish."

1,Rotten,Warcraft is just one more in a long line of less-than-stellar video game movies.
0,Fresh,"It's a rare American film that is willing to risk not having the protagonist learn the right lesson -- especially if the filmmaker, too, is ambitious to move on to bigger things."
1,Rotten,"There are no real laughs in here, only chuckles of recognition at the rough cadence of comedy, acknowledgments of the empty spaces where we expect humor to reside."
1,Rotten,The woman getting her groove on on the screen in front of me might as well have been a complete stranger.
0,Fresh,A spiky media satire about the making and marketing of a revolution that most definitely will be televised.
1,Rotten,"The big twist is a good one, there are some decent action sequences and Lizzy Caplan is always good to watch, but there isn't enough here to keep things from dragging."
0,Fresh,A documentary whose chief aims - at which it succeeds - are to mourn a fallen activist angel and rile audiences into rage.
0,Fresh,"This affecting film is one of the year's more intriguing art-house entries, and doesn't deserve to be simply relegated to a niche audience."

1,Rotten,"Much of the film is harmlessly generic, but in its last half-hour it plumbs new depths of dumbness that markedly lower its overall score."
0,Fresh,"Universal questions: How is it that Sam Rockwell, one of the finest actors on the planet, has yet to get the notice he deserves? And how could you miss this stellar feature?"
1,Rotten,"The movie is inert, despite the fact that it bombards us with lurid imagery and high-intensity stimuli: frozen Dachau victims, dying Nazis, beautiful child murderesses, abandoned graveyards besieged by hurricanes."
0,Fresh,Succeeds as a tour-de-force for Willem Dafoe.
0,Fresh,"...it's hard to go wrong with a film that features such choice bits of dialogue as ""nobody ever wins a fight,"" ""be nice until it's time to not be nice,"" and, of course, ""pain don't hurt."""
0,Fresh,"Possibly the single most subversive fact about the film is that all else being equal, it's one of the best original movie musicals in a generation."
0,Fresh,"A thoroughly engaging and enlightening documentary, which gets up-close-and-personal with the three female Pussy Riot members that were sent to jail for a satirical performance in a Moscow cathedral."
1,Rotten,"This is a movie filled with a painfully obvious story and manufactured mawkish moments. It's doesn't just pluck our heartstrings, it thrashes a power cord"

0,Fresh,"""Mayhem"" embraces its pulpy title with fighting-and-fornicating glee. Neither innovative nor particularly clever, the movie understands its mission and benefits from Mr. Yeun's unfailing air of basic decency."
1,Rotten,"Most stunning is how abruptly the film ends, but I suppose that's to be expected when a production simply runs out of money."
0,Fresh,"With this cast, it would be hard to mess up 2 Guns."
1,Rotten,"Joan Allen delivers some solid Oval Office-worthy stuff, and Jeff Bridges has fun with his Clinton-esque persona. The plot, however, never quite gets off the Beltway."
1,Rotten,"Offhand, if you'd like to see some great imagery about writing, then you should by all means rent this and skip to the good parts."
0,Fresh,"... straight forward, thrilling action adventure featuring gorgeous visuals and very little of what made original fans of the Trek series geek out."
1,Rotten,"Going in Style is an amiable comedy, at best, with fine performances and enough good-natured heart to make you smile. It just doesn't necessarily have an abundance of laughs."
1,Rotten,Its commercial compromises cripple it as a movie.
0,Fresh,"Interesting yet over-long, melodramatic and fatally predictable, Road Games is a backwoods horror film with a sheen of class, respectability and Barbara Crampton. These things go some way to save the day."
1,Rotten,"I know any mention of Heigl will set off sirens of alarm in some moviegoers, but she's given little latitude for annoyance here, being largely confined to a single facial expression of steely whack-job malice."
1,Rotten,Courtney Hunt's film ultimately plays as little more than the cinematic equivalent of a trashy airport novel.
0,Fresh,"As fine as the cast is (with Knightley turning in a small but genuinely affecting performance), the film's stand-out star is right there in the title."
0,Fresh,"Along with Pillow Talk it's one of Doris Day's most delightful and enduring romantic comedies, and the kids get a two-for, since she's paired with pop culture icon Clark Gable."

1,Rotten,"Intended as a thriller, The Glass House is a nonstop riot, with dialogue so ludicrous the only logical reaction is stunned laughter."
0,Fresh,The classiest aspect of the production is the pictorial glamor and dynamism achieved by Reynolds and cinematographer William Fraker. Sharky's Machine always looks alive.

0,Fresh,"Flamboyant Danish journalist-documentarian Mads Brgger takes on a deep, dark and nefarious topic--the harvesting of blood diamonds in the Central African Republic--but within a comic, loopy framework."
1,Rotten,"Next time Ferrell ventures south of the border, he might want to take a gag-writer with him."
0,Fresh,"The movie plays out slowly, but it's not an action movie, so that's okay. It's all about emotions with deep connections between the characters."
0,Fresh,"Black Magic for White Boys ends up resembling the kind of urbane satire that might make Turkel's counterparts in Manhattan blush, but its thematic bite pierces the skin."
1,Rotten,Blackwood's over-reliance on the sudden materialising of various apparitions to illicit jumps never quite works.
0,Fresh,"Does anyone feel a morale-boosting ""younger man"" romance coming on? ...But not in a predatory way, which might win a cheap laugh, but in a life-enhancing way that makes you feel more kindly disposed to all the characters involved."

1,Rotten,"This is one of those many movies where there's nothing terribly wrong, and yet it still never feels even remotely right."
0,Fresh,"Co-writer/director Satoshi Kon's 2002 Millennium Actress comes close to achieving the highest artistry while delivering a bittersweet, deeply moving narrative."
0,Fresh,"Does not come within a thousand miles of Pulp Fiction for philosophy, story and character development, but for style it blows every other movie this year out of the water."
1,Rotten,"Outside of a running joke about Sandler's dog humping a giant stuffed animal and the usual anger/pain humor that runs through his work, the film devotes most of its energy to a drearily sentimental lesson about what's really important."
1,Rotten,"Though Masha's courage is considerable, her change of heart finally feels too nuanced for Pedersen's streamlined political-drama treatment..."
0,Fresh,"an eccentric, audacious musical that, like ""Moulin Rouge,"" blends backstage drama, tragic romance and flights of fantasy into a story that bravely jumps from genre to genre and from era to era."
1,Rotten,"The quirky allure of Joan Cusack can offset a lot of sentiment in a movie, but even she drowns in the goop of Martian Child."
1,Rotten,"Fantastic Four is an uneventful ride, plunging us into the depths of choppy editing, poor CGI, laughable costume design and one of the worst third acts in the history of superhero films."
1,Rotten,"In one rotten production ... all involved have managed to create the most unlikable, man hating, woman hating, unfunny idiots since Whipped."
1,Rotten,"Pity, because whether the suits greenlighting things like this realize it or not, the fact that they've sacrificed both art and creativity in pursuit of a dollar isn't just a shame, it's a crime."
0,Fresh,"Subtly stodgy, it's an engaging but ultimately forgettable espionage thriller."
0,Fresh,"The film proves entertaining enough to pass the time with a quartet of women, who even when saddled with mediocre material, rise to the occasion time and time again"
0,Fresh,"The Dark Knight Rises is resonant, emotional, and sometimes beautiful, but it's also overlong, overstuffed, and oftentimes frustrating."
1,Rotten,"Anderson - not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson, the fearlessly ambitious director of 'Magnolia' and 'There Will Be Blood' - has created a movie worthy of its own video game."
0,Fresh,"While BlacKkKlansman may unfold as a triptych of rage, fun and pride, what it is is a call to fly at full-staff the willingness to preserve good."
0,Fresh,"This is a movie that's expressly built for children, but it had enough nostalgia, visual wonder, and a fun performance by Jim Carey that it manages to elevate past that."
0,Fresh,This is what a romantic comedy looks like when it's being built on scar tissue.
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, and thankfully, it's saved by its stars, who carry it all to safety as often as they can."
1,Rotten,"How do you solve a problem like Melissa McCarthy? That question feels inescapable after watching her try to powerlift ""Tammy,"" her newest and least funny comedy, all by her lonesome."
0,Fresh,"From intimate shots beneath the feet of the giant beasts to underground footage, directors Stone and Deeble have made a movie that leaves viewers as much in awe of the animals as of the filmmakers' ability to capture remarkable moments."
0,Fresh,"Blackhurst and McGinn do a vise-tightening job with the unpacking the facts as we now know them, as we never knew them (including rarely seen court documents and police video), and as they were originally distorted beyond all reason."
1,Rotten,"The characters are fun and the plot serviceable, but it distinctly lacks a hook."
1,Rotten,"Has a powerful enough context behind it, but ... it disappoints ... Still, Olsen is a star worth following and has carved out an impressive niche in the psychological thriller genre."
0,Fresh,"I find it to be one of his most sublime achievements, filled with a sunny laziness and slow awakening."
0,Fresh,"Honesty about the difficulties, both large and small, of being part of a family is what Ramona and Beezus does best, even if the rough and dangerous edges have been filed down."
0,Fresh,"If the key performances in ""Beautiful Boy"" were any less honest, the film's half-formed suppositions would undo it utterly."
0,Fresh,"Mitchell's performance as Hedwig remains one of the best of modern times -- the character is by turns sexy, scary, outrageous, obnoxious, pitiable and vulnerable -- and it anchors a movie that landed on my list of the 10 best films of the 2000s."
1,Rotten,'Strange Wilderness' isn't funny enough to produce anything more than a few slight chuckles. We mostly groan and squirm in our seats while watching it.
0,Fresh,"What the movie lacks visually, it makes up for with the performances, especially by Lindon, who leads us on a journey we want to stick with even if we can't fully understand."
0,Fresh,"It's fun to watch Noomi Rapace act against herself six times over and her game performances in the midst of fast-paced action make ""What Happened to Monday?"" a mostly enjoyable thriller."
0,Fresh,"The blend of slow motion imagery and accelerated time lapse photography along with the use of multiple cameras instils Sherpa with an evolving vibrancy, reinforced by a stirring orchestral score which heaps ever more emotion on knife edge proceedings."
0,Fresh,"Unfortunately, the story gets too caught up in the politics, and though Moore delivers an emotional ending, we're not given the chance to get to know Laurel and Stacie - just what happened to them."
1,Rotten,"Dull. ""The Tiny Terror"" is presented as uninteresting and a watered-down passive-aggressive writer for our PC consumption."
0,Fresh,Probes the value clashes in a middle-class Los Angeles black family
0,Fresh,"The analogy between wild-spirited mustangs and incarcerated men who have lost their freedom is pretty standard stuff, yet the nuances of character, story and subtle, yet profoundly felt emotion keep viewers involved."
1,Rotten,"It's aimed squarely at primary schoolers, but they'll probably get fidgety before its 111 minutes elapse."
1,Rotten,"Unwatchable -- and, thanks to its high-decibel action sequences, barely listenable -- this misbegotten medieval fantasy/stoner comedy marks a new low for David Gordon Green, once ranked among the most promising young filmmakers in America."
1,Rotten,...a perfectly acceptable cartoon movie of its kind. If you like its kind.
0,Fresh,A refreshingly original slice of indie quirk that manages to pull off the kitchen sink approach on a very meager budget.
1,Rotten,"For a movie that places so much emphasis on the soul, Ghost Rider is conspicuously devoid of one."
1,Rotten,"Among exceedingly stiff competition, this may well be the worst Friday ever. Hear that squelching noise? It's little Jason spinning in his watery grave."
1,Rotten,"While the film is absorbing and not without pathos, there's insufficient insight or shape to the screenplay, which drifts between Hollis and Jacob without building momentum."
1,Rotten,"While watching insipid romantic comedies, I often cling to the comic supporting characters as my life preserver."
0,Fresh,"Clint Eastwood, the director, achieves another milestone with Letters From Iwo Jima. Maybe only a filmmaker of his multi-Oscar-winning, all-American rank could stage such a brave project."
1,Rotten,"I guess if you like Rainn Wilson alot, you might enjoy it. But I find his humor flat and tedious. I can't believe this is from the Oscar-nominated director who made THE FULL MONTY."
0,Fresh,"Repeat after me, Meryl Streep is amazing."
1,Rotten,"Most of Submergence feels curiously flat, given the frustration that the characters go through once they are separated."
1,Rotten,Tedious and unfunny virtually from start to finish...
0,Fresh,More closely resembles The Social Network than it does can-of-corn horsehide epics like Field of Dreams or The Natural.
1,Rotten,The bigger the film's structure grows the weaker the foundation becomes until it all comes crashing down.
0,Fresh,Probably one of the most unusual coming of age films you'll ever hope to see.

1,Rotten,The Wedding Guest has all the right pieces there but fails to pull together into quite the finished product the high standards of its individual components suggest.

1,Rotten,"The Girl on the Train spends so much time on shock value, it neglects the aspects of fluid, substantial storytelling."
0,Fresh,"To say the film is sitcom-y is to belabor the obvious. ""Ramona and Beezus"" is a welcome throwback to the nuclear-family-centered sitcoms of the 1950s and '60s and a low-tech charmer, and the cast elevates it all, especially King."
1,Rotten,"Straining to capture artistic frenzy, it descends into vulgar chaos, less a homage to Federico Fellini 1/2s 8 1/2 (its putative inspiration) than a travesty."
0,Fresh,"The terrain of grief is well mapped-out in American art movies, but Rabbit Hole finds some subtle new pathways through it."
1,Rotten,Transformers: The Last Knight is like staring at a projected kaleidoscope for two and a half hours and then trying to tell someone about the plot.

0,Fresh,"A powerful, heartbreaking, empowering experience."
1,Rotten,"Despite Stuber's cars, sex, guns and buddy cop-fueled engine, its one-star stupidity brings its occasionally-amusing Uber ride to a screeching halt."
0,Fresh,"There's little tension, as we don't get to know anyone, but this is still a pacy, death-strewn romp that combines satire and eye-popping horror with flair, if not much finesse."

1,Rotten,"The suckers here are the poor mugs who leave their dollars at the door. And for what? A seedy, desaturated, overstimulated simulation of a real movie. Schlock treatment for comatose gamers, and a bomb with a bright pink cherry on top."
0,Fresh,"As it goes on, Revolutionary Road starts to feel like a tepid rewrite of a Douglas Sirk weepie."

1,Rotten,"Simplistic, superficial and surprisingly sentimental, Purple Rain is everything Prince's music is not."
1,Rotten,"Its comedy is from the do-anything-for-a-laugh school, without even the polish of the Three Stooges, and the melodrama evolves from rote characters and cliched situations."
0,Fresh,"This might be the Coen Brothers' best film. I suspect they think so too. Even if you sense they can't quite grasp what they've stumbled across here, and surely don't want to."
1,Rotten,The problem with The Master is that it doesn't extend or expand Anderson's artistic journey.
1,Rotten,"The remake shows all the guts of the original, but there's not a glimpse of its brains or its heart."
0,Fresh,"A chilling, cautionary tale that needs to be seen by a wide audience. My only fear is that many will take away the wrong message from the film, thinking how daring these young revolutionaries were as they tried to blow up our government."
1,Rotten,"Well, it's not awful."
1,Rotten,It's got some of the comic-noir-y small town murder plot of 'To Die For' without the payoff. It's got some of the male midlife crisis of 'American Beauty' without the nuance.

0,Fresh,"An intriguing film, that has a sense of poignancy, sparse dialogue and offers a deep suspicion of love if it's untested."
1,Rotten,"Boring, sanitized slobs vs. snobs comedy."
1,Rotten,"... Matt Weiner's meandering feature debut resembles bad TV, or TV made bad by abbreviation."
0,Fresh,"Learn from your mistakes is the theme of this endearing third film in the franchise in which the awkward, tumultuous highs and lows of pubescence continue"
0,Fresh,"Promare is an animated movie for the child in all of us, the way classic Disney movies under Walt himself were."
0,Fresh,"A loopy, ghastly, funny, morbid and unforgettable 100 minutes"
1,Rotten,"Lightweight item is innocuous and well-intentioned but terribly feeble, another example of a decent idea yielding the least imaginative results conceivable."
0,Fresh,Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
1,Rotten,"The Wachowskis have accomplished the impossible by making a garish, over the top movie based on a vaguely remembered cartoon that is, painfully mediocre."
0,Fresh,"It's an exceptional movie, which isn't a rare achievement for the helmer, but this material is clearly pulled from deep within, making it his finest effort to date."
1,Rotten,"The preaching is earnest and the intentions are good, but the corn is high and the presentation is amateurish."
0,Fresh,Whether or not The Woman in Black provides those chills is entirely up to whatever particular type of creep-out sends shivers down your spine.
0,Fresh,"one of Ford's masterworks, a sublime, crisp, unpretentious western that doesn't wear its mythos on its sleeve"
1,Rotten,"Stone's re-re-re-treading of the same issues that have pre-occupied him since he was fighting in Vietnam - drugs, corruption, military, power - is tired."
1,Rotten,"Apatow's descent as a storyteller is continuing, and his ear for comedy isn't at its peak."
0,Fresh,Three Billboards is great.
0,Fresh,"Sound of My Voice grounds its science fiction in scarily effective ""what ifs"" that don't require a light year's stretch of the imagination."
0,Fresh,"As a horror film, Hereditary delivers the goods, with crack pacing and a third act of sheer gothic madness."
0,Fresh,"You leave ""Merchants of Doubt,"" as you do any good muckraking documentary, both fascinated and enraged ..."
0,Fresh,Director Yorgos Lanthimos challenges society's demands that we mate - for life.
0,Fresh,Red Lights is a gripping and convincing French psychodrama with a tour de force performance by Jean-Pierre Darroussin.
1,Rotten,"Dr. T isn't a dreadful movie, but its spontaneity does feel forced, and we glean very little that is satisfying from the example of Dr. T's confusion."
0,Fresh,... offers a character-based exploration of insecurity and gender politics that provides depth even amid some narrative gimmicks.
0,Fresh,"The veteran cast is wonderful, making the most of a movie whose sole reason to exist is to make audiences smile."
0,Fresh,"There's too much color and energy and frenzy in this movie to discount it entirely, but it has a disconcerting tendency to undercut its best notions with some singularly awful moves."
1,Rotten,"Tim Meadows is very funny and entirely endearing, and it's too bad he got himself into this mess."
1,Rotten,"Snake Eyes opens on a roll, but ultimately craps out."
0,Fresh,Funny Face...teams Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn in a delightfully balmy romance.
0,Fresh,"You can use electricity to make ice, which is pretty much what Statham does in Taylor Hackford's jaggedly satisfying thriller, Parker."
0,Fresh,"It all adds up to an offbeat, unusual horror film that totally has its own identity."
0,Fresh,"It's rare for a film about a Mexican drug cartel and the impossibility of the American Dream to be either disarming or funny, but Clint Eastwood has blessedly delivered one that is consistently both."
0,Fresh,For a sequel it is anything but horrible. Lots and lots of laughs and a most unique car chase at the climax.
0,Fresh,"However you interpret the flick, at the very least it will have you talking."
0,Fresh,"Surrogates stays afloat by not taking itself too seriously, but also by recognizing that a movie about robots shouldn't look as if it were made by one."
0,Fresh,"""Annabelle Comes Home"" is definitely scary, from a sequence in which a blood-spattered bride circles a room, to one in which Daniela watches images of herself on a haunted TV set."
0,Fresh,Flashes of deadpan outrageousness occasionally redeem the dourness.
0,Fresh,brilliantly conceived
0,Fresh,A delightful little surprise.
0,Fresh,"Iron Man is fantastic, a sure fire blockbuster that will leave audiences breathless and fanboys wanting more."
0,Fresh,"Moors doesn't approach these conventional war-film narrative threads from a straightforward perspective. Instead, he subverts our expectations."
0,Fresh,"This is a fantastic summer movie featuring a superhero that I was so excited to finally see fly back into theaters. ""Man of Steel"" shows nothing but promise for the future of Superman and DC Comics."
1,Rotten,the Big Bad Wolf in this fairytale is Naomi Wolf.
0,Fresh,"Cruise dominates, as he has in every recent movie, but this time, it actually works in the story's favour."

1,Rotten,Plays like a bloated director's cut.
1,Rotten,"By the time this match of wits reaches the inevitable mano-a-mano final showdown, viewers will probably have become weary from all of the incoherent plot twists and ludicrous contrivances."
0,Fresh,"The Forbidden Kingdom may be nothing but disposable fun, but it is a great, heaping, overflowing helping of fun. If you're 10, it may also seem like Citizen Kane."
0,Fresh,This chilling psychological thriller that keeps us hardwired to our seats gives charismatic Paul Walker a fine platform on which to display his considerable talents
1,Rotten,It didn't evoke more than the occasional smile from this viewer.
0,Fresh,Underrated family drama; Duvall and Jones are terrific
1,Rotten,"Something's missing, and it's the question of whether any prison sentence can ever be as painful as living with guilt, its own form of inescapable punishment."
0,Fresh,"Lacking much of the sarcastic edge found throughout Pixar's hits, we're able to appreciate the naive optimism that endears Seuss' creations to us, without looking for a rotten ironic core."
0,Fresh,"The Mill and the Cross may thrill you. But be prepared for a fight. Twenty minutes in, your companion may throw up his or her arms and complain, ""This is like watching a painting dry."""
1,Rotten,It doesn't matter how disarming Franco's single-handed performance is; there is simply not enough dramatic meat on the bones of Ralston's true story to distract us from where it is heading.
0,Fresh,"Despite an element of gross bodily fluid-laden gags, Blockers manages to be heartfelt and endearing -- even if the film's message is sometimes heavy handed."
0,Fresh,"An enjoyably dopey actioner best viewed as a homage rather than a remake. Not a barrel ride, but no wipeout either."
1,Rotten,"Melissa + pornographic puppets equals a movie that doesn't please anyone. Remember friends don't let friends go see ""The Happytime Murders""."
1,Rotten,"For devotees only, I'm guessing."
0,Fresh,"Relentless without being overbearing, this is one likely blockbuster that doesn't feel too big for its britches. It's a friendly juggernaut."
0,Fresh,"[Images of WWI are] terrible, but shadowy and distant, and it takes an extraordinary film on the order of Joyeux Noel to make it all suddenly vital, immediate and human."
0,Fresh,the best entry in the series since Saw II.
1,Rotten,"The cut-rate production resulted in what Reeve termed ""catastrophe"" for a film intended to marry a serious message to the series' signature action, humor, and romance."
0,Fresh,"A great contraption of a film, The Prestige is a classy little maze of distractions, obsessions and showmanship, a magic trick of a movie that keeps the viewer mesmerized and then ends with a flourish."
1,Rotten,Would be a candidate for the year's most unintentionally funny movie so far - if it weren't also the most homophobic.
1,Rotten,The wildly colorful costumes and the jubilant defiance of the film's terrorizing tykes simply is not enough for Nanny McPhee to get its hapless house in order.
0,Fresh,A film noir with a bracing twist of black comedy.
0,Fresh,"It eventually lands on something that works pretty well... The first half, though, feels like the movie has to restart very nearly every single time it changes locations."
0,Fresh,It's one of the best films of the year so far.
0,Fresh,"Refreshingly, Bird Box gives a much more complex depiction of pregnancy and motherhood in a post-apocalyptic setting."
1,Rotten,"An instantly-iconic 'this is a born action-heroine' turn by [Gilpin] ... She looks sharp with the weapons, spits out her one-liners with aplomb and looks like an absolute beast in the brutal hand-to-hand combat moments."
0,Fresh,It's great to see a movie musical with a smart sense of the genre.
0,Fresh,"In a genre that's become so devoid of originality, Tom Six's movie is the type of disturbing and disgusting gamechanger, much like the breakouts by Hooper, Cronenberg, Miike..."
0,Fresh,"What emerges is a fascinating and illuminating story, one that runs the gamut from intense joy to deep sadness and features a couple of surprising twists that take proceedings off in strange and unusual directions."
1,Rotten,"Fun for kids, maybe. Sheer drudgery for anyone beyond a Jr. High School reading comprehension level."
0,Fresh,Surprisingly funny bickering couple movie.
1,Rotten,"There's nothing wrong with a gritty cop drama, so long as it has something to offer besides grit."
0,Fresh,"This fourth and allegedly final outing leads the men into new, untraveled territory for the series, while delivering a delectable cinematic dish."
1,Rotten,"A dull, lacklustre, obnoxiously stupid sequel."
1,Rotten,"As far as I'm concerned, very little of what happens in this glossy teen-weepie romance can be described as surprising, and even less of it feels fresh or spontaneous."
0,Fresh,"I went into it feeling a bit low and came out of it feeling a bit better. It's a reminder that sometimes there's a beauty in just going along with ordinary life, which is short, even more so for dogs."
0,Fresh,With Sommers' work it's hard to know where the fan stops and the director starts.
0,Fresh,"The film interestingly makes its young heroic lead an atheist rather than the usual follower of Christ, but some script deficiencies hamper the overall project."
1,Rotten,"This complete waste of 82 minutes finds documentarian Morgan Spurlock taking a look at current trends in men's grooming, featuring interviews with a random sampling of people who have no idea what they're talking about - but they're famous."
0,Fresh,"The movie may falter a little in the middle, but the courage [of the 2 men] and the rescue attempt in the final act are what you'll remember and what makes this movie worth seeing."
1,Rotten,"Described as the stoner-version of Bourne Identity, Max Landis' script manages to hit a fair number of highs; though it also falls victim to its own ambitious amalgamation of genres."
0,Fresh,"Iif you're in the mood for a film of staggering beauty that will open your eyes to one of the wonders of the natural world breathtakingly captured in all its glory, color, and movement, this is a must see."
0,Fresh,"Brief, explosively funny, and sardonic as hell ""Carnage"" is what you might get if you condensed three of Woody Allen's early films into a 75 minute one-act. This movie is a kick."
0,Fresh,"Snow and Bautista deliver serviceable performances, and glimmers of humour give welcome relief in this darkly moody tale."
0,Fresh,This is the cannibal conga line that is the Hollywood food chain.
0,Fresh,"Crazy Heart feels familiar, even comforting, offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted, immaculately judged, wholly authentic emotion."

1,Rotten,"So laid-back that it barely registers, despite starring two guys who haven't exactly been shrinking violets in previous outings."
1,Rotten,"As a character, Burt Wonderstone runs counter to Steve Carell's inherent sweetness. In Carell's hands, Burt comes off as a 50-calorie Ron Burgundy. When he tightens his vocal cords to hit Ferrell's register, the strain is as visible as it is audible."
0,Fresh,"As a movie, it is expectedly exciting, yet not nearly as heart-pounding as its predecessor. It's well assembled but it lacks the impactful horrors and falls well short."
0,Fresh,Nicely dramatizes an event almost as impressive as Israel's freeing of hostages from Idi Amin at Entebbe airport.
1,Rotten,"Kudos to you if you can figure out what in god's name that ending is supposed to indicate, because I'm lost at this time..."
0,Fresh,"Like a real-life game night, the comedy may not leave a lasting impression, but it's plenty of fun while it lasts."
0,Fresh,"Even when the laughs are less frequent, they continue through to the end, with plenty of quotable lines."
1,Rotten,"It feels less like a taut feature film, and more like the series finale of a long-running TV show. It's all reference and parody and fan service."

0,Fresh,"With raw emotional scenes but a great deal of deadpan humour, the witty script really hits it out of the park."
0,Fresh,One of the great anti-war dramas.
1,Rotten,"Where Someone to Watch Over Me falters is, oddly enough, in the central relationship."
0,Fresh,"30 Days of Night is a high-concept movie idea that's so good, I'm surprised we haven't seen it."
0,Fresh,"With its subtle cultural critique, this is one B-movie that's smarter than it seems."
1,Rotten,Late-period Eastwood that lacks the earnest introspection that defined his earlier works.
0,Fresh,"For those who enjoy this brand of wholly mindless entertainment, Crank delivers."
0,Fresh,"It's a charming film, but you may end up glad, perhaps for the first time in your life, that you don't live on Telegraph Hill, no matter how incredible the views of Alcatraz."
0,Fresh,(Marc) Forster's subtle yet powerful blend of reality and Barrie's flights of mental whimsy combine for the rarest of the rare: cinematic excellence.
0,Fresh,"Another two hours hanging out in the Wachowskis' world. There's a groovy, multicultural, pansexual vibe where all are welcome and the deliberately artificial visuals are to die for."
1,Rotten,"Aside from what we get in the big dance scene, the songs are of little interest, and each one feels like an intrusion."
0,Fresh,Confirms that the RomCom is not really dead.
0,Fresh,"An intensely intimate look at the frustrations of ambitious, large-scale filmmaking."
1,Rotten,... what did you expect? Originality? Wit? Narrative sense? Emotional resonance?
0,Fresh,"The Good German is Steven Soderbergh's game attempt to reinvigorate the dense intrigue of classic wartime thrillers like The Third Man with a contemporary, neo-noir edge."
1,Rotten,"Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who jointly wrote and directed, are hacks whose sheer ruthlessness makes them effective to a degree."
0,Fresh,"enjoyable adventure, with a delightful beginning and an exciting finale making up for a somewhat muddled middle."
0,Fresh,"While T2 wasn't necessary, we'll all be glad it happened anyway. Boyle has managed to craft both a worthy tribute and a piece of cinema that will stand on its own in another 20 years' time."
1,Rotten,gives its heroine all the rough edges of a throw pillow... Susann couldn't write sentiment convincingly and neither can Rudnick.
0,Fresh,Bernie Mac's ear to ear smile and personal charisma help him knock this one out of the park.
0,Fresh,Falls short of a laugh riot but proves generally pleasing nonetheless.
0,Fresh,This suspense-challenged spy opera nonetheless can serve today's CIA recruitment program with its look-see into the training program at 'The Farm.'
0,Fresh,"Loaded with a wealth of songs, it's meaty, not too kaleidoscopic and yet closely knit for a compact 100 minutes of tiptop filmusical entertainment."
0,Fresh,An enjoyably leftfield oddball comedy.
0,Fresh,This is an insider's fascinating meditation on the nature of genius and stardom and the toll they take on the naively optimistic.
0,Fresh,"It's flawed and a bit convoluted, but worth seeing simply because the idea behind it is so intriguing."
0,Fresh,"I enjoyed it, but also forgot how crazy it was, and kinda wish it was a straight drama..."
0,Fresh,"McKinnon's timing, physical comedy and utterly joyful presence are the highlights of the film. If anything, she's not given enough screen time."
0,Fresh,"Snitch runs close to two hours, and it's a credit to Summit Entertainment that they didn't reduce it to 90 minutes of Mexican drug loons trying to run John's truck off the highway."
0,Fresh,"With Boy Erased, Joel Edgerton proves that he is an apt director who can deftly manage mystery. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"Filled with implausible incidents meant to buttress the premise that Obama was an outside to both Blacks and whites and generally devoid of any deep psychological or political insights, it is worth watching on Netflix just for laughs."
0,Fresh,"Welcome to the 21st Century edition of Sherlock Holmes, a well-rounded gent as likely to flex his brawn as his brain!"
0,Fresh,"Deranged thriller will certainly split audiences, but it's a daring piece of cinema."
0,Fresh,"[Director Sall]Potter, who also directed ""Tango Lesson,"" ""Orlando,"" and ""Ginger and Rosa,"" puts so much into the excellence of ""The Party"" that it's hard to tease apart."
1,Rotten,Wildly mediocre.
0,Fresh,"As history 'Selma' may cause some controversy, but as fact-based drama it's exceptionally fine."
0,Fresh,"Director Raymond De Felitta, working from a strong, vivid script by Jonathan Fernandez, finds the perfect mordant comic tone with which to tell this improbable but true story."
1,Rotten,a movie that gives new meaning to the term 'endurance test.' Even by the low standards of the college comedy genre it's exceptionally awful.
0,Fresh,"This narrative gambit allows Niles to score a quiet but stunning rhetorical point: in their meticulous attention to detail, the blue-collar workers who've spent their lives at the plant seem just as artistic as any musician."
1,Rotten,It's like a music video of Helen Reddy's 'I Am Woman' filmed in the Chevy Chase Pottery Barn.
0,Fresh,"Burn Your Maps is filled with adventure and a whole lot of heart. The plot is a bit too fantastical, but the strength of the performances grounds the narrative when needed."
1,Rotten,"A perfect movie personification of the holiday -- crass, commercial and guaranteed to make a zillion dollars off the love struck masses. Ugh."
1,Rotten,Energetic if empty sequel.
0,Fresh,Creepy but exciting Burton fantasy based on best-seller.
1,Rotten,"The amazing thing about John Woo's steely, impersonal adaptation of Philip K. Dick sci-fi story ... is how it vanishes in front of our eyes even as we watch it."
1,Rotten,Tuneless ABBA tunes sung in a combination prequel & sequel by ever smiling stars in predictable movie musical fashion. A better title: Mamma Mia: Why'd We Go Again?
1,Rotten,"...a bit like a poor man's Four Weddings and a Funeral... Although there are a few laughs and the slick script is peppered with juicy one-liners, it's mild and rather mannered as we fail to connect with the characters when it really matters."
1,Rotten,"One can't blame Colfer for wanting to expand his range, but he's created a character who is neither hero nor villain, in a black comedy that is neither dark nor funny enough."
0,Fresh,"This is also Jackson's feature debut, and like Jensen he succeeds brilliantly with a film that engages through visuals and character, through revelation and mystery..."
1,Rotten,Utterly impossible and hapless.
1,Rotten,An ambitious but instantly generic urban crime drama that conjures up the usual assortment of cliched' streetwise grittiness
0,Fresh,"What makes this chillingly creepy little black-magic folk tale work so beautifully is its evocative sense of time and place ... Well, that and composer Mark Korven's unsettling soundtrack full of screechy, dissonant strings."
0,Fresh,"The result is an excellent family film - maybe not up to 1996's ""Fly Away Home'' in the kid-helps-wildlife genre but eye-opening and heartwarming and sensibility-expanding all the same."
0,Fresh,A truly great B movie.
0,Fresh,A real family treat.
0,Fresh,Mixes fantasy with grim realism in a fable about two outsiders who are drawn together.
0,Fresh,David Cronenberg's underrated second film continues to develop his theme of body manipulation.
0,Fresh,"Much of Frida is impressive and striking, flavored by Taymor's undeniable visual skill, but her efforts are rather stymied by a pedestrian script."
0,Fresh,Diplomacy will work for those who appreciate dialogue-based character films in which plot is of secondary importance.
0,Fresh,"With dashes of comedy, some simple yet effective twists of myth and complex combo after combo of slick, hyperkinetic action by Yuen Woo Ping, this funky Monkey never lets down its guard."
0,Fresh,"It may have helped that the negative buzz around the film had our expectations pretty low, but Aladdin is one of cinema's most pleasant surprises of 2019."
1,Rotten,"Kind of a poor man's Inside Out or Up, the story fails to earn its emotional stripes and instead goes haywire with non-stop hecticness involving barely sketched characters."
0,Fresh,"Presents likeable characters, puts them in tough situations, and illuminates their souls with humor and sincerity. It just so happens that the two men who populate this story used to wear leather S&M gear onstage and play guitars with dildos."
0,Fresh,"Although The Machinist may at times seem to be derivative of those films, and is inferior to them, it is nevertheless a harrowing experience for those to whom this sort of story appeals."
0,Fresh,"Riddled with awesome fight scenes, outfitted with a great tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and equipped with one of the screen's most interesting duo's of recent times, Bulletproof Monk translates very well from the pages of a comic."
0,Fresh,"If your dentist offers you red wine after he x-rays your teeth, he's probably seen 'K-19.'"
1,Rotten,"It's all very glossy, yet remains an emotionally arid affair."
1,Rotten,"Bolstered by a killer soundtrack and a tornado of craziness, this Netflix original movie still feels sloppy and rushed."
0,Fresh,[A] no holds barred take down anchored by a mesmerising central performance from Christian Bale.
1,Rotten,I'm left feeling like I went to the All-Star Game and only got to see them shoot free-throws.
0,Fresh,"The Italians do a sort of romantic film best, but they start with a big edge: Italy. In Facing Windows, they have Rome and the warm colors and the food, and a very good cast led by immensely appealing Giovanna Mezzogiorno."
0,Fresh,"It's pacy enough to secure at least our divided attention, competently trotting along in the background revealing surprises that aren't really that surprising, like a pulpy, well-worn airplane novel that you guiltily devour in a day."
0,Fresh,"With its Hollywood-ized (read: sentimentalized) look and feel and a script that plods along in places, Stone's safe Center is just a fine film -- instead of a great one."
1,Rotten,Succeeds in making the 109 minute running time feel like at least eight of the eleven years he took to shoot the film.
0,Fresh,"Starvation, cannibalism, heinous violence and no small amount of feces aside, THE PLATFORM makes spending time in The Pit a pretty intriguing enterprise."
0,Fresh,Teller and Woodley are phenomenal. My heart was floating through The Spectacular Now -- and you know what they say about what goes up.
1,Rotten,"Mix... genital obsession with bad CGI, unrelenting references to Lego Batman, and a general sense of malaise, and you have a pretty complete picture of what Show Dogs has to offer."
0,Fresh,"Somehow Soldado gets by, thanks to strong performances."
1,Rotten,"At this point, it's tempting to wonder if Jeff Bridges accepts roles chiefly on the basis of whether or not he'll get to sport grizzly facial hair and talk funny."
0,Fresh,"It is a work of magical realism, or perhaps moderate insanity. And it will take your breath away."
0,Fresh,...a tribute to the director-star's admirable work ethic more than anything else.
0,Fresh,To say that Final Destination 5 is the best installment since the original is both faint praise and a pleasant surprise.

0,Fresh,The Death of Stalin has atypical humor and is lethal in its agile and sharp dialogue. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,The kind of thrill ride that they used to make more often during the summer season - an over-the-top action movie made strictly for adults. Keep your superheroes. Give me more of these.
0,Fresh,"The seesaw effect of the characters' clarity and confusion helps Curran & Co.'s unexpected, occasionally heavy-handed fumblings toward examining spiritual emptiness find purchase."
1,Rotten,"There's certainly an audience for this film, but not a big one."
0,Fresh,"As tough as it is to take in, and perhaps even tougher to contemplate, Mysterious Skin demands serious consideration and appreciation for Araki's evident maturity. He's a grown-up, finally."
0,Fresh,"Instead of painting a dapper Indiana Jonesian picture of a valiant white man making friends with the natives and conquering the jungle, it shows Fawcett as self-obsessed."
0,Fresh,The holes in the story are papered over with such beautiful photographs that few viewers could complain.
1,Rotten,"The film introduces too many elements, doubles back on itself, repeats and repeats the same information, starts and stops, includes needless tangential riffs, finds artificial means to stretch the running length and is in every way a flabby mess."
1,Rotten,"Enough stylish, bizarre touches along the way to at least qualify the film for future cult status."
0,Fresh,[This movie] scares the holy piss out of me.
0,Fresh,One of the few recent films to recognize how closely a movie can resemble a memory bank.
1,Rotten,"If your film choices are dictated by what is in the $2 pile at Blockbuster, I imagine this kind of easily justified pro-war sentiment would go down a treat, especially with a bottle of cheap whiskey."
1,Rotten,The roots of deconstructing Hollywood and the cancerous underbelly of privilege and fame hang there but never quite connect in a meaningful way.
0,Fresh,See it because it's uproarious and lyrical and (aha) human.
0,Fresh,You won't be able to resist the film's ribaldry and cynicism. Kids these days!
0,Fresh,"Score one for Ella Enchanted, an overpowering winner in the realm of smart family entertainment."
1,Rotten,There's not much else to sink your teeth into once the pretty colors fade from view.
1,Rotten,"Hfstrm leaves no loose end untied, and no easy sentiment untapped, but there's a didacticism to Evil that undercuts its sturdy narrative construction."
1,Rotten,"Oy, such terrible jokes and choppy direction."
0,Fresh,Imagine an out-there cartoon and watching it spring to live-action on the big screen.
1,Rotten,Even the special effects aren't very special.
1,Rotten,"...about 15 minutes of action, violence and thrills diluted in about an hour of watching large men roam small, pipe-filled corridors holding absurdly large weapons."
0,Fresh,The shattering confessions that kick off Disturbing the Peace make up for its imbalanced worldview.

0,Fresh,"It's an over-the-top spectacle of action violence, and I loved it."
0,Fresh,... A political thriller that concerns itself more with issues of loyalty and trust than advancing a particular agenda.
0,Fresh,"Maudie is an inspiring, heart-warming true-story film that most audiences will find hard to resist."
1,Rotten,"The script by first-time screenwriter Jack Paglen is so full of half-explained cyber-nonsense and wheezy, kneejerk man-vs.-technology clichés, it borders on the ludicrous."
1,Rotten,Frustratingly stillborn.
0,Fresh,Australian film-makers Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich have done a great job in making the world's most deadly reptile as scary as a shark.

1,Rotten,"Oh, the hilarious awkwardness of placing privileged white kids in a place where they don't belong."
0,Fresh,There's a lot of melodrama. But the quality of the writing and the acting in particular elevates it.
1,Rotten,It's got lofty aspirations but it also wants to wallow in the muck - to thrill you and sicken you in equal measure while also being About Something.
0,Fresh,"...what should have been a searing, powerful documentary generally comes off as a rough cut that's desperately in need of some judicious editing."
1,Rotten,"HOTEL MUMBAI is excellent at creating tension, but terrible at turning it into any meaningful empathy with or understanding of its wider roster of characters, despite the best efforts of Dev Patel."
0,Fresh,"However readers may have seen the story in their minds - the unshaven and rumpled Affleck is about a decade older than I imagined, but effectively seedy - Fincher crafts its scenes of a broken marriage into a convincing mosaic."
0,Fresh,"Henry's Crime is quieter than either of its genres leads one to expect but, perhaps because of this, it provides a lot of fun throughout."
0,Fresh,Director Jorge Grau has an incredible eye and creates a lavish horror spectacle.

1,Rotten,"As dental experiences go, Tooth Fairy doesn't hurt as much as you might think."
0,Fresh,While the the film is representative of the absolute worst of Universal horror... it is one of the very best Abbott and Costello vehicles.
0,Fresh,"Thanks to a tight screenplay by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin and the unflagging pace set by director Roger Michell, Changing Lanes doesn't feel overburdened by all its drama."
0,Fresh,So darn watchable that it could turn someone who never heard of the Flaming Lips into a devoted fan.
1,Rotten,Witless.
0,Fresh,"There's no denying the movie's greatness: the depth of the characters, the urgency of its narrative, the nightmarishness of its vision."
0,Fresh,"Bright 'n' breezy, conveying a pop-psychology message about hope, picking up the pieces, starting over and moving on."
1,Rotten,"I did like the performances, even though Blanchett was a bit stagey. However, with this paper thin storyline that is overly drawn out, I did not care about the fate of the two main characters and the whole thing left me emotionally cold."
0,Fresh,"Sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is offhand. Even when you're on the edge of your seat, it never sacrifices a calm, clear-sighted humanity for the sake of melodrama or cheap moralizing."
1,Rotten,"Despite the various surprise cameos and cute twists, it takes itself too seriously and adheres too strictly to its formula to avoid becoming what it parodies."
1,Rotten,"Imagine a mix of Sky High and The Incredibles with all the fun, laughs and clever adventure taken out and you've got director Peter Hewitt's atrocious comic-book fiasco."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, this visual glory is the movie's best asset."
0,Fresh,It's what Transformers fans have wanted and needed for a long time.
1,Rotten,"The Tennessee middle school's story is worth hearing, but rather than a feature-length documentary, it's best suited as a short TV newsmagazine package."
1,Rotten,"It's disappointing that the movie doesn't pack anything more potent than slow-motion, flag-waving montages to make its patriotic point."
0,Fresh,I give directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield huge props for being able to so concisely whittle down their massive 11-episode magnum opus into such a delightfully entertaining and visually stimulating streamlined version.
0,Fresh,"The affable, shaggy-dog tennis comedy Break Point is bristly and charming, just like its star and producer, Jeremy Sisto, who plays the affable shaggy-dog Jimmy Price, a washed-up semi-pro tennis player."
1,Rotten,"I'm not sure if The Road could ever have worked on the big screen, but I am sure that this version could be used to make that case."
1,Rotten,"The script is so formulaic, the atmosphere so bright, the acting so off, it's a bit of a mess."
0,Fresh,"At age 88, Resnais hasn't lost his capacity to confound."
1,Rotten,"""The Whistleblower"" is a one-note affair that offers glimpses of the rich, broad life Bolkovac clearly lives but deifies her into someone inaccessible and unbelievable."
0,Fresh,"A work of memoir shattered and reassembled into a universally moving, truthful fiction."
0,Fresh,Netflix's The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) is the dysfunctional Jewish family that This Is Where I Leave You wanted to be.
1,Rotten,"There are the odd few tender moments, but they are only brief interludes between more sturm und drang."
0,Fresh,Prisoners is a devastating ordeal through the Villeneuve's impressionistic prism. It's a testament to all involved that you want to revisit the ugliness of the story for the artistry of its construction.
0,Fresh,"Bujalski has a fantastic eye. The movie was shot in black and white with '70s video cameras, and could easily be mistaken for a documentary."
1,Rotten,"Taken independently, these chapters probe the thorny porn star-viewer exchange, but Kittredge can't connect the dots into a worthy climax. In other words: all foreplay, no full release."
0,Fresh,"Burke and Hare is a film that's hard not to like, imbued as it is by American director John Landis with a charm and naivety that belies its rather grotesque subject matter."
1,Rotten,It's an aggravating film that seems content to skim the surface before folding up its tent after a scant 88 minutes.
1,Rotten,Hawke is very trying as he spouts Shakespeare's 16th-century wisdom in the setting of 21st century New York in this Hamlet.
0,Fresh,A daring and unsettling film about a few of the complex and taboo emotions of grief.
0,Fresh,The feelings Sheridan evokes in the last scenes are earned: they encapsulate the whole story. And they stay with you long after it's over.
1,Rotten,"A jumping off point for showy, contrived, borderline exploitation sequences that fail to tie together because they're not really there to do anything but sell themselves as money shot thrills."
1,Rotten,"Director David L. Cunningham keeps it all moving right along, but it's still malarkey."
0,Fresh,"""Strange Powers"" moves with lightness, verve and charm, which Magnetic Fields fans might find amusing, given Merritt's well-known morosity."
1,Rotten,...suffers from a pervasive lack of laughs that's compounded by writer/director Mel Brooks' relentlessly (and exhaustingly) over-the-top sensibilities.
1,Rotten,"There's certainly a visual confidence to the first third of the film that hints at greater things ahead for Watts, but the storytelling is pretty flat and predictable."
0,Fresh,"Ash becomes Jia's most resonant work in at least a decade, a film in which the warring impulses within a single character cut through the noise of big themes and national metaphors."
0,Fresh,"But the real heroics come from the team of animators who bring the stop-motion ""puppets"" to life. They are astonishing, rich, masterfully unique creations."
1,Rotten,"As a documentary dissertation on all that it means to be male in the modern world, you'd be better off investing in the complete works of Ernest Hemingway and watching a few Samuel Fuller and/or John Milius films."
0,Fresh,"The filmmaker narrates with droll, front-porch wit, and eases his way into the viewer's heart by sharing a hefty portion of his own."
1,Rotten,"Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming. Maybe there's a metaphor here, but figuring it out wouldn't make Trouble Every Day any better."
0,Fresh,It's a joy to see female characters written with such depth and played so achingly well by actors at the top of their game.
0,Fresh,This dramatic comedy is an Italian style Mean Girls.
0,Fresh,"Russell Crowe's portrayal of an overweight, amoral CIA honcho in the Middle East thriller Body of Lies is mesmerizing, chilling, disturbing to the bone and one of the best performances of the year."
0,Fresh,This reboot hits almost the same good notes as the original 1984 classic. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Despite its various weaknesses, What Happened to Monday is still weird, wacky fun, a B-movie with a capital B."
0,Fresh,"A heartfelt, yet excessively maudlin, look at the Vietnamese conflict that led the U.S. into a full-blown warfare controversy."
0,Fresh,... an eerie return to old-fashioned scary movies. You get the sense writer/director Victor Salva really takes this seriously.
0,Fresh,"For anyone who is willing to challenge their own ideas of what this story means and how Biblical stories can be told, 'Noah' is one harrowing ride."
1,Rotten,Saw II is a nasty piece of work ...
1,Rotten,"After a promising start, Bridget Jones's Baby gets more nonsensical as it goes, culminating in a ridiculous race to the hospital that should have embarrassed everyone involved."
0,Fresh,"Although this remake of the 1962 classic is beautifully shot and acted, it's so hollow and bleak that it leaves us cold."
0,Fresh,"Mesmerizing, everything on the screen helping us follow her routine with a domestic rigor that replaces dramatic structure."
1,Rotten,Pioneer is a conspiracy thriller that mostly illustrates how comparatively tedious real-world corporate conspiracies are.
0,Fresh,"Silly, very un-PC, often laugh-out-loud funny and refreshingly short on bathroom humor, Beerfest is Strange Brew's endearingly ungainly cousin."
0,Fresh,"The outrageous pee-pee poo-poo jokes from the second movie haven't gone away, but the knowing spy humor from first movie has returned."
0,Fresh,Ben Stiler shines as Brad. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"The Wind Rises, believed to be his swansong, certainly feels like a final film: grand, eloquent and epic, it's Gone With the Wind-esque in scope and purpose."
1,Rotten,"It is faint praise to note that Tuesday, After Christmas is the most approachable of recent Romanian releases. Still, it's neither revealing nor compelling."
0,Fresh,"...still functions as a potent moral tale, this time with a particular awareness of patriarchal oppression."
0,Fresh,"The seasons, summer especially, are so atmospheric and weighted with many good associations and memories, all of which makes A Summer's Tale a nice cinematic diversion for any season."
0,Fresh,Another classic movie from the master of Japanese animation.
0,Fresh,"The Farewell finds the laughs between the tears, with the tone never forced. It's a film that has stayed with me long after I left the theater."
0,Fresh,"If you look the other way and go with it regardless, Man of the Year can be an idealistic pleasure."
0,Fresh,Director John Cameron Mitchell's restrained handling of the film's rawest moments keeps it from descending into soul-wrenching lamentations.
1,Rotten,"If Mulholland Drive had a prettier, younger, and developmentally-challenged sister, it would be Southland Tales."
0,Fresh,"Goes down easily without a hint of tedium...still, this short length contributes to an overall feeling that it's not as Earth-shatteringly fabulous as some other cartoon features of the last several years."
0,Fresh,"While we may not be able to trust any of the characters in Trance, we can certainly count on the filmmakers to deliver a story that holds us transfixed from start to finish."
0,Fresh,A razor-sharp homage fueled by a clever script and hilarious performances from its stars.
0,Fresh,A solid war drama gets bogged down in a routine mystery.
1,Rotten,"Set in 1958 Hollywood, Warren Beatty's polished film about a starlet, her driver and billionaire Howard Hughes starts with promise but fizzles into a drawn out, tedious disappointment. There are some wonderful moments, though."
0,Fresh,An extraordinary story by any measure.
0,Fresh,"If you want to see it as a parable, that's up to you. In all ways, the film plays its hand gently."
0,Fresh,"The Russos understand how to pace action better than many of their MCU contemporaries, and as such, Civil War moves at a rapid clip despite all the table-setting and it being the lengthiest Marvel film to date at 146 minutes"
0,Fresh,"It's an exercise in intimate unease that presents a potentially fantastical storyline but grounds it in reality and offers characters we actually like, no matter how flawed and frustrating they might be."
1,Rotten,Verhoeven sets up and then fails to deliver lavish satirical ways of having fun with invisibility.
1,Rotten,Don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk.
0,Fresh,"Mikhanosvky turns his camera on communities that are frequently marginalized in both film and in American society. Immigrants and people with disabilities are often ignored, rarely protagonists in films unless portrayed by a famous actor."
0,Fresh,"This might be a trifle, but it's an entertaining trifle."
0,Fresh,"And apparently there's life after Downton Abbey. In a 180-degree departure from that show's scheming Miss O'Brien, actress Siobhan Finneran plays Swifty's abused, soft-spoken mum. She and the boys are wonderful."
1,Rotten,"Keenen Ivory Wayans is so much more interesting, lively, and fun than Seagal you wish that he were the star of the film."
0,Fresh,"Annie Hall is refreshing because it showed an astonishing leap in creativity, exploration, and cinematic curiosity from Allen's previous film."
1,Rotten,"At least he's being honest: Johnny English Reborn makes no attempt to hide Atkinson's shameless thievery, his lack of invention or even his graying hair."
1,Rotten,"""Pain & Gain"" is the type of film that makes you feel like need a shower after you watch it."
0,Fresh,Has the ability to both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in today's horror films. It's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again.
1,Rotten,"It's pretty solid; and everything in it - the darkness, the claustrophobia, the jump scare, the grotesque creatures - works the way it's supposed to, but we're not in the '80s anymore."
0,Fresh,KING KONG: SKULL ISLAND is an entertaining B-movie with first-rate special effects and expertly staged action
0,Fresh,"The Boss Baby"" gets kudos for its originality, its quality animation and its editing. However, the overall story is a bit of a one-note theme, and after the first 45 minutes or so, it gets tedious."
0,Fresh,"Even though we don't really care about the dialogue or script at times, it's easy--and fun!--to be distracted by the pretty pictures."
1,Rotten,Utterly disappointing.
0,Fresh,Any movie that casts Tilda Swinton as the angel Gabriel has its heart in the right place and a serious screw loose -- two things worth wishing for any time you lay your eight bucks down.
0,Fresh,"As adaptations go, this is a match made in heaven."
1,Rotten,It takes a certain amount of power to convince four talented actors to deliver performances that are shrill and irritating.
0,Fresh,a hallucinogenic late summer treat
0,Fresh,Has an age-old Licence to Thrill
1,Rotten,A disappointing film because it simply doesn't live up to the enormity of its subject matter; it doesn't engage us but batters us into submission.
0,Fresh,"It is a bleak film, but Zvyagintsev's artistry means that it is not just compelling, but more involving than you'd ever think possible, given the two main characters are so unceasingly terrible."
0,Fresh,Una obra maestra.
1,Rotten,I'd have to say it's purr-fectly awful.
0,Fresh,"It's a beautifully composed, enigmatic movie with a high-concept plot about two men on either side of the planet who are mysteriously connected by midlife despair and existential emptiness."
0,Fresh,"As Farhadi's first Spanish-language feature, ""Everybody Knows"" shows that he can excel in multiple genres."
1,Rotten,"This is some of the worst writing of the year, from the meaningless title down. Oh yeah, and a tramp keeps showing up to beat up Dano throughout. Not quite sure why, but I applaud the effort."
0,Fresh,"Secondary characters are caricatures and there are moments of symbolism that are too heavy-handed, though on the whole The Queen is dignified."
0,Fresh,"Violence, language, drinking in snarky, twisty thriller."
1,Rotten,"Unhappily, the film shares a serious flaw in the essential conception of the show; both are founded on a phony literary analogy and on some potentially vicious pseudo-sociology."
0,Fresh,Robin Wright Penn delivers the mature performance of her career as the title character in 'The Private Lives of Pippa Lee.'
1,Rotten,Attends to its heist-thriller obligations with needless solemnity and a studious lack of imagination.
0,Fresh,[VIDEO] Here's the first great Hollywood action movie of the year.
0,Fresh,Charming and often quite funny.
1,Rotten,An opinionated motormouth reveals sociopathic tendencies in an Irish micro-budgeter that's the very definition of a hard slog.
0,Fresh,Anyone prepared to make a trilogy of films about life as an Arab citizen in Israel deserves praise for audacity.
0,Fresh,A victory of style over substance.
0,Fresh,We hollered and clapped. It's that kind of movie. Ultimately cool.
0,Fresh,"There's nothing fancy about Mavis!, but there doesn't need to be-the music itself, and the infectious and upbeat spirit of Mavis Staples, still touring at age 86, more than carry the film."
1,Rotten,"A hagiography of the late hip-hop star Christopher Wallace a.k.a. The Notorious B.I.G., this overlong biopic glosses over so much detail and avoids the real man so much, it's a fan-magazine profile gone B.I.G.-screen."
0,Fresh,"There is a gritty, hard-boiled feel to 'L.A. Confidential' that is so audience satisfying."
0,Fresh,"Previously responsible for a number of hit-or-miss shorts, Mathew Kane is making his feature debut. You wouldn't know it from watching. His ideas aren't new, but he finds new and mature ways of updating them."
1,Rotten,Mediocre action pulp.
0,Fresh,"Quite simply, is the best movie I have seen all year."
0,Fresh,American Gangster is 2 1/2 hours of pleasure with a guilty aftertaste.
0,Fresh,"Come To Daddy is dark, unexpected, bloody and fucking hilarious - not to be missed!"
0,Fresh,"Spectacular and spectacularly goofy...Even if you find the story ludicrous, the visuals will keep your eyes occupied--if not your mind."
1,Rotten,"Another manga live action manga adaptation butchered, how long will this genre have to wait before it has its Spider-Man 2 moment? Before we get a good one? Longer still it would seem. Today is not that day."
1,Rotten,Riding the Bullet is a film that will likely appeal to more non-horror fans...
0,Fresh,"Though Leonie is slow at times, it highlights a little-known historical figure in a manner that is emotionally and intellectually satisfying."
1,Rotten,"In this case, unhappily, 'O' stands not so much for 'Othello' as for 'Zero.'"
0,Fresh,"Supposedly based on a true story, The Reef does a good job of portraying tension while keeping the shark hidden (and simple). [Full review in Spanish]."
0,Fresh,"Costner may be the star, but the high school athletes also shine. After all, this ""based-on-a-true-story"" movie is their story, too."
0,Fresh,"Tati mimics American idealism with the tour bus women's 'golly-gee, wow!' attitude, and isn't any easier on the French's to-do, prim-and-proper persona."
0,Fresh,"Well executed action thriller by Das Boot German director Petersen, which is rather weak in plot and characterization."
0,Fresh,"The best bits -- the powerful instrument called Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, for example -- more than speak for themselves."
1,Rotten,"With its formulaic story and hackneyed dialogue, all there is to do in between moments of self-aware outrageousness is admire the decor ..."
0,Fresh,"As von Trier seeks our own understanding & sympathy, the question he keeps provocatively posing is not only whether Jack's work can be considered art, but also how different von Trier's own art, showing us humanity & life in negative, is from Jack's."
0,Fresh,[A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
0,Fresh,"If you have been faithful to the franchise, you will surely love this movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Shadow Dancer feels like a thriller, but Marsh is wisely more interested in the tension than in the release. What thrills exist here are carefully tempered by the considered pacing."
0,Fresh,At once enchanting and emboldening...
0,Fresh,"""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end."
1,Rotten,"A snazzy-looking mixed bag. Kids will be diverted, adults will tolerate it, and all involved will be expecting something more imaginative than what Jerry Seinfeld has whittled together."
1,Rotten,"Sometimes there is pleasure to be found in brainless action, but the extended video game-style finale left me furious and fatigued."
1,Rotten,"Unlike the unfilmable novel, Newell's discordant picture exhibits the worst symptoms of fever itself: unpleasant to endure and then quickly forgotten."
0,Fresh,"If you like to have your brain (and your heart) engaged when you watch films, this is a documentary you don't want to miss and you don't have to be a Nobel Prize winner to see the value of it."
0,Fresh,"Few movies capture so well the fluid, fulsome response of children to their (and our) complex worlds."
0,Fresh,"horrific, and quite honorable"
0,Fresh,"The fact that the robot is more human than the humans is, to put it in computing terms, a bug, not a feature"
1,Rotten,"A slapdash embarrassment of feeble age gags and cultural stereotypes, Old Dogs is at once crass, corny, amateurish, insulting, uninspired, deeply phoney and extraordinarily unfunny."
0,Fresh,"Jennifer Connelly nails her performance, keenly displaying the self-destruction of a woman grasping for anything that might take things back to the way they used to be."
1,Rotten,"Despite its supposedly hard-hitting veneer, the film never goes out on a limb when it counts."
1,Rotten,Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything.
0,Fresh,The artfully superficial relationship between Bill and Rose works to the plot's advantage.
0,Fresh,A real chiller thriller.
0,Fresh,Eighth Grade is the kind of movie that makes you feel like you've stumbled onto buried treasure...
0,Fresh,"Smart, hard-charging, compassionate."
0,Fresh,"Selma tells a great story about a triumphant moment in civil rights history and the losses it took to get that win, but it doesn't nostalgically let us forget that this moment is just a chapter break in a longer war that still rages on today."
0,Fresh,The enjoyably ridiculous antics of F8: The Fate of the Furious can't fix a fissured film that sags under the weight of its divided narrative.
1,Rotten,"Some of the intense, ultraviolent vignettes on the rough streets of Los Angeles are more compelling than others, but by not having a consistent narrative thread, the film builds only intermittent suspense."
1,Rotten,A stylish but fatally shallow puzzler that suggests a Twilight Zone episode filmed on the leftover sets of Seven.
1,Rotten,"Just in time for the first frost of the season comes 'Random Hearts,' a romance between two ice cubes that moves at the speed of a glacier."
0,Fresh,"Banks smartly sticks with what works: sarcastic humour, more than a dash of slapstick and big songs."
0,Fresh,"This is awful! I'm just kidding...it's really good, and Downey, Jr. is perfect for the part."
1,Rotten,"Bloated at 126 minutes, its long-windedness a letdown for a franchise that has yet to capture a confident, clip tone and rhythm. The further it goes, the more it falls victim to this lugubriousness."
0,Fresh,"As king of the paparazzi, Ron Galella has been slugged by Marlon Brando, sued by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and slurred by other photographers. Now, filmmaker Leon Gast turns his camera on Galella, and the result is fascinating and full of surprises."
1,Rotten,Sadly empty exercise.
0,Fresh,"He has honed this material, beefing up jokes and cutting out fat, and his comedy has become tighter, funnier if also slicker, shifting from a story of a comic struggling with demons to one describing how he once was lost and now he's found."
1,Rotten,Wait-for-video more than straight-to-video.
0,Fresh,"So, yes, if you watch inherent Vice as a whodunnit, you'll be disappointed -- but if you watch not as a whodunnit but rather as a whahappened, it's a film that's both funny and freaky, a pitch-perfect portrait of a time that never was."
1,Rotten,Marginal effects and a laughable story.
1,Rotten,"I found myself unmoved by Bernadette's stasis, her on-the-rocks marriage and even her quest to get her creative spark back."
0,Fresh,"...Garner's performance effectively keeps things interesting, even when the film is going through the motions..."
1,Rotten,"Ritchie means to be deep here, yet he's never seemed so shallow."
1,Rotten,A big stampede of a movie with ideas and scenes thundering off in dozens of directions.
1,Rotten,"You get the general sense that the actors -- particularly Annabeth Gish and, though he is hardly featured, D'Onofrio (who was last seen as the troubled recruit in ""Full Metal Jacket"") -- are better than their material, but this is scant compensation."
1,Rotten,One of the biggest problems here is that the material is so routine and by-the-numbers.
0,Fresh,The film only seems to come to life when showing how challenging is the climb and how unpredictable and harsh mother nature can be.
0,Fresh,"A poignant reminder that social issues, in the end, are personal matters."
1,Rotten,"""Family is not an F-word,"" but Deadpool isn't the same without it."
1,Rotten,Whether or not you think Dolittle is actually a movie for children depends on one question: Do you hate children?
1,Rotten,"This film romanticizes suicide. It does everything studies have shown causes suicide rates in teens to increase. Justice Smith proves he is an acting force we will see for years to come. Hopefully, in less potentially destructive films."
0,Fresh,A little twisted and completely hilarious.
0,Fresh,"Directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, the film does nothing fresh with its scenes of tension and violence, but they're pretty entertaining, and some of the added touches of black comedy are excellent."
1,Rotten,"Cheaply shot, discernibly under-written, decently acted, unimaginatively directed, and ultimately pointless."
0,Fresh,"Before you can say, ""Gangsta's Paradise,"" Coach has motivated his team to focus on what's important -- winning."
0,Fresh,"As with any shark movie, there are so many nods to the greatness of Jaws I stopped counting, but the beach scene here is a standout."
1,Rotten,What the film does fumble is the relationship between George and a student (Nicholas Hoult) whose gaydar he must have set off.
1,Rotten,The main problem is the movie hems in Murphy.
1,Rotten,"Shrilly pandering to edgy, jive-talking, hip-hopping bents of the moment, [Shark Tale] churns up a sea of offensive ethnic stereotypes, unfunny situations, unsympathetic characters and lousy plotting."
0,Fresh,"You do feel the weight of a little too much going on, but at the end of the day, the movie never breaks under that. Easily the best villain the MCU has ever had."
1,Rotten,Basically it's a war movie with four or five shots of giant monsters. The film would be exactly the same without them. And the characters are underwritten and unmemorable.
0,Fresh,"Kind hearts, good laughs, and a conclusion that almost makes you glad you sat through one of the most insufferable first acts in movie history."
1,Rotten,"An aesthetically fussed-over, feel-bad character study-the ugly American narrative rejiggered for Generation Hipster."
0,Fresh,"The most brilliant editing of the year revs you up as it interlaces the apex of story lines, and then explodes into a giant orgasm of emotional and physical movie making only to roll over, light a cigarette and stop paying attention to you."
0,Fresh,"The combination of its realistic backdrop, boy's own adventure and Robert Downey Jr makes for a blast of a new style comic book hero in Iron Man. Above all, humour is what elevates this highly entertaining fantasy into something beyond our expectations."
0,Fresh,Relic is true fright fest thanks to intelligent storytelling and extraordinary special effects that effortlessly blend reality and fiction.
1,Rotten,Savages says nothing we do not already know about the illegal drug trade.
1,Rotten,All the Stuckey Pecan Logs in the world couldn't make this road trip worth it.
0,Fresh,"It's Jonathan Caouette's insistence in going back to his nightmarish old footage, or the old footage that he purposefully renders nightmarish, that seems more interesting."
0,Fresh,"one of Welles's greatest late-stage accomplishments-a very nearly magnificent amalgam of plot points, characters, and dialogue from not just one or two of the Bard's history plays, but five of them"
1,Rotten,"The sincere message -- perseverance is essential when faced with life's setbacks -- is a good one, but the movie is a bit of a chore to watch."
0,Fresh,"The Perfection is ridiculous, grotesque, funny, timely, suspenseful, unpredictable, sometimes visually inspired, sometimes scary and sometimes amusingly stupid - but always entertaining."
0,Fresh,"A terrifically enjoyable piece of old-fashioned storytelling and a beautiful-looking film: spectacular, exciting, funny and fun."
0,Fresh,"One of Lee's best -- save for the didactic opening credits, he's rarely been less preachy and more insightful"
0,Fresh,"A follow-up to the romantic 2 Days in Paris, this farcical comedy revolves around familial and cross-cultural clashes."
1,Rotten,"The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context, which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots (or cinema seats)."
1,Rotten,"A two-hour version of the Jules Verne story that is only intermittently fun, despite lavish expenditures on CGI and stunt work."
1,Rotten,A poorly paced kidnapping drama that seems to think it's so prestigious that it doesn't need to generate much suspense.
1,Rotten,"London Has Fallen has its charms, [but] this lean, mean POTUS-in-peril action thriller is ultimately hindered by its reluctance to fully embrace its own stupidity."
1,Rotten,"...much of Secret Window will seem old hat to anyone who knows what ""redrum"" means."
1,Rotten,There's some pretty solid and rather nifty playing with time travel in Reset. That is until the third act...
1,Rotten,"The directorial debut for ace cinematographer Wally Pfister is always watchable, but the narrative flaws and logical leaps sabotage sustained enjoyment. ""Transcendence"" looks and sounds like a Christopher Nolan film that got attacked by malware."
1,Rotten,"The G.I. Joe team is back, and most of their sophomore movie adventure, G.I. Joe Retaliation, is as bland as their name and as subtle as an exploding tank."
0,Fresh,How reassuring to realize that happy surprises are still possible. Hitch is one of the happiest.
1,Rotten,"Lawrence delivers on what dramatic beats half a novel affords him. You just wish there were more of them and that they provided a more complete, more satisfying story arc."
0,Fresh,"A pensive, intelligent vampire-angst movie."
0,Fresh,"Jammed with multi-layered stories, stellar performances, and an intoxicating subject matter, Traffic is a riveting and powerful film that can best be described as Nashville on drugs."
1,Rotten,"A fantastic reason to see something else this weekend, The Crimes of Grindelwald is a massive disappointment and the prospect of having to sit through three more movies before this story is completed is downright depressing."
0,Fresh,"""Rudderless"" is a quietly ambitious film, and if it eventually collapses under the dramatic weight it's asked to shoulder - and it does - at least it's trying."
0,Fresh,It is a spellbinding journey.
0,Fresh,"While it's different from the Muppet movies I saw as a child, this film has the same charm and irreverence I've come to expect from these fuzzy little guys."
0,Fresh,"A pleasant enough experience. However, it probably could have used a little more of the bizarre or dysfunctional to spice things up."
0,Fresh,Every situation is presented with maximum lucidity and almost complete inscrutability.
0,Fresh,"Eschewing blood for a sinuous tone of Videodromic dread, Ring forces fear into every cut as a psychic telejournalist counts down the hours till a fatal visitation, while making a gung ho attempt to save her brood."
1,Rotten,"When Worthington and his wacky trio are allowed to loosen up, The Shack radiates with undeniable sweetness, but the darker elements grind it to an unnerving halt."
0,Fresh,"While Kayla Day is very much a teenager of her precise time and place, her gruelling anxiety - and Fisher's wonderful yearning in the role - make her universally relatable anyway."
1,Rotten,The summer of inessential animation continues with this very middling sequel to 2014's semi-forgotten squirrel-based timekiller.
1,Rotten,"Rabid with a female lens isn't camp, it isn't satire. The Soska Sisters's take on Cronenberg's cannibalistic horror film is full of empty calories."
0,Fresh,"Valiente cinta, bien lograda y de soberbia actuacin, aunque el tema ser muy cuestionado y habr quien la cuestione por lidiar con las temticas de lo injustificable."
0,Fresh,"While 'Quartet' seems to be part of a double feature with 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,' it does lack 'Exotic's' breadth of characterizations and humor."
0,Fresh,A near-perfect blend of looks and heart.
0,Fresh,"What generally makes or breaks films of this type are their focus on character, character, character, and this film succeeds in radiating light through its stars."
0,Fresh,"Nothing happens in this film that you don't expect to happen, and it's that lack of originality that causes the film to drag in spots. But it's still a perfectly fine, little film whose earnestness and cast chemistry ultimately won me over."
0,Fresh,Its positives outweigh its negatives; certainly it will send shivers up the spine of anyone who has ever been out on the open water and thought about the dangers down below.
1,Rotten,"Nobody would pay much attention to this plodding but good-hearted film if not for its star, Clint Eastwood, although he's just dialing in the go-to Cantankerous Old Man mode on which he has relied for a decade or so."
1,Rotten,"'The Heat' is about as generic a movie title as you can get, but calling the Sandra Bullock/Melissa McCarthy film 'The Disappointing F-Bomb Fiasco' may have been a bit too specific."
0,Fresh,"Emma, with all her preening, gossipy self-love, is somehow the perfect Instagram-age heroine. Her actions in this adaptation and with Taylor-Joy's characterisation are not those of a giddy romantic obsessive, but of an unapologetic, empowered woman."
0,Fresh,"In Sling Blade, Thornton lays claim to the title of hyphenate of the year."
0,Fresh,Fans of the show will not be disappointed.
0,Fresh,"There are weaknesses here--especially when the climax becomes too packed and chaotic, and the goodby over-hasty. But Meyer and Flynn get a fullness back into the characters."
1,Rotten,It sticks in the craw.
0,Fresh,"All hail, Dame Mirren!"
1,Rotten,"Chris Rock was busy directing, producing, co-writing and starring in this light comedy. Given his hilarious stand-up routines, one wishes he had spent a little more time on the script."
0,Fresh,"Given its status as pretty standard genre fare on the surface, the film goes down as a pleasant surprise and one that embraces its dark heart."
1,Rotten,Most of the time the movie coasts aimlessly along like a car stuck in neutral.
1,Rotten,"The presence of a star (Connery), a great actor (Howard) and Fonda doing his turn as the US president add no credibility to an old-fashioned concept."
0,Fresh,A filmmaker who here has refined his forms to distill the very essence of his way of understanding cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,Last Flag Flying is a low-key gem.
0,Fresh,"Worth seeing mainly for Chaney's remarkable performance; even bowed and constricted by the heavy weights he used to help simulate Quasimodo's crippled gait, his body remains extraordinarily expressive."
0,Fresh,Director Paul W.S. Anderson has injected a great sense of fun in this visually sumptuous adventure
1,Rotten,At least a modest disappointment for those of us who consider ourselves fans of James L. Brooks.
1,Rotten,It's striving to be cool to the core ... but it ultimately has more in common with Beetlejuice than a black mass.
1,Rotten,"If 3D is going to make a giant leap, it requires a more exciting movie than this."
1,Rotten,"Despite [Oyelowo's] acting chops, it is difficult to feel sympathy for him since we do not have the opportunity to learn much about his character."
1,Rotten,"You go to the film hoping for good dialogue and some salty exchanges, and go home with nothing particularly memorable."
0,Fresh,"Stylish but shallow, this could be the director's next franchise, along with Eleven and Magic Mike."

0,Fresh,Rush may be the best movie about car racing ever made.
0,Fresh,"Films like A Ghost Story-so odd and outside the typical cinematic experience-don't happen often these days, but when they do they can remind us of the power of the cinematic image."
0,Fresh,The novel was written for young adults and the film feels like it pulls its punches. The final horrifying revelation is still a long way from the painful realities of those days.
0,Fresh,...it's a meta movie that goes deep on deconstructing the slasher formula.
0,Fresh,"A well-made, edge-of-seat action thriller that's no more serious - and often just as much fun - as Channing Tatum's White House Down."
1,Rotten,"The writing is abysmal, the acting wouldn't pass muster in a high school play, and the direction by erstwhile stuntman Steve Boyum (Timecop: The Berlin Decision) is positively sleep-inducing between cycle jumps."
1,Rotten,"A pretty zappy effects showcase, weighed down by a protracted, soul-challenged Frankenstory that short-circuits every time it gets moving."
1,Rotten,It's an embarrassment for all involved.
0,Fresh,One of those highly effective conventional pictures that remind us that conventionality isn't always a bad thing.
0,Fresh,"Pixar clearly still have the edge when it comes to organic storytelling, but if Dreamworks' latest effort is anything to go by then visually at least the playing field has been levelled."
0,Fresh,A movie with clarity and grownup complexity.
1,Rotten,"Movin' on up to the movie big time means Sex and the City can no longer be accepted as just a cable-TV party game. It has to compete with the big girls, Hollywood's classic representations of female beauty, desire and strength. And it doesn't."
0,Fresh,The smart indie isn't afraid to make Communism the scariest monster of all.
0,Fresh,The film builds an implausible scenario into a credible and utterly charming romantic comedy.
1,Rotten,"As a psychological study of secret agents, The Bourne Identity is too much carnival ride and not enough John le Carre."
0,Fresh,"Last Days in the Desert drags a little too long, but is interesting in its consideration of Jesus as a man, not only a religious figure."
0,Fresh,"Jacob is so good in the role, so effective at suggesting a mingling of innocence and intuition, that it's easy to imagine why Red was written with her in mind."
1,Rotten,It is ultimately disappointing to see such an inspiring real-life figure get such an uninspired epitaph.
1,Rotten,The gag is evident from the get-go and the movie just repeats itself until its obvious conclusion.
1,Rotten,The film appears to have been not so much directed as welded together out of other bad movies that have crashed and burned.
0,Fresh,"This movie has the eerie tang of so many other wretched Roberts vehicles of the past...but somehow, it manages to produce a moderately good film"
0,Fresh,Nonstop entertainment.
0,Fresh,"This is an engaging film about a real family and about optimism in the midst of hardship, but it's also a fascinating historical document."
0,Fresh,"Michel Hazanavicius's black-and-white throwback to cinema's silent era may seem steeped in fusty nostalgia, but it glitters and gleams with utterly of-the-moment wit and romantic zest."
0,Fresh,"Although it's the most important film of the year, it will still be a hard sell to hard-headed truth-deniers."
1,Rotten,"This had the potential to be hilarious, but instead falls alarmingly flat thanks to a weak and jokeless script that even the combined comedic talents of Williams and Crystal can't perk up."
0,Fresh,"The power of this film resides in how visceral it makes the story. Not just in terms of the violence, but the true intensity of the story. It's an exhaustive experience."
0,Fresh,Liebesman relies on his genre-film resume to keep events moving at a brisk clip and the motion-capture process employed to facilitate live-action integration with cutting-edge VFX looks superior onscreen ...
1,Rotten,"Three to Tango isn't a waste of time, it's just a middling affair, which would have been better as NBC's 'Romantic Comedy Movie of the Week'."
0,Fresh,Linklater has crafted an always genial and at times even joyful period charmer about that moment on the cusp: before a boy becomes a man and another man becomes a mythological figure.
0,Fresh,"A haunting suspense drama, which compares favourably with some of the best continental cinema."
1,Rotten,"Presented as a sort of romantic neo-fairy-tale, the movie rarely acknowledges the inherent creepiness of its premise."
0,Fresh,"Green, whose style refuses to be pinned down, embraces the slasher genre without submitting to it."
0,Fresh,"They're back, sweetie darlings-though it feels like they never left us."
0,Fresh,"It's a little heavy-handed in an area where it needs to be, but this can speak on its own. It does a good job of bringing this to light, and it makes you angry."
1,Rotten,You know a video-game-based movie is bad when making it look more like a video game is an improvement.
0,Fresh,"At various moments, Coco is simply the most beautiful film Pixar has ever made, each shot a striking work of art."
0,Fresh,"Support is top notch across the board, with John Ortiz (""Ali"") most notable as Octavio Ruiz, a pantless crack addict who set his girlfriend's hair on fire for giving him the clap who then goes on to profess his love for her"
0,Fresh,"These women were warriors, their story deserves to be told, and director Sarah Gavron does a fine job with a classically filmed production."
1,Rotten,A special-effects extravaganza that skips over basics like coming up with an interesting origination myth for the creepy creatures who bring havoc to a sleepy suburb.
1,Rotten,A sequel that relies too much on CGI to work. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"The second half of the film devolves into something that resembles tedious, melodramatic daytime TV."
0,Fresh,"A triumph of pure cinema and wonderful visual storytelling from Chandor, who must now be considered the real deal, while Redford is sublime in what could well be the performance of his career."
0,Fresh,"Falling squarely into Oscar Bait territory is (this) try-hard Holocaust drama, a factually inspired, somewhat strained story about French collusion with the Nazis."
1,Rotten,"Just when you thought Disney had turned the corner on live action features (""Eight Below""), out comes this rather tired re-attempt at humor."
1,Rotten,The scary part is that this movie got made.
0,Fresh,There's a sharper film lurking somewhere insider... But those wanting a more detailed exploration of organized crime in Italy - and the mental trauma it inflicted on soldiers and civilians alike - would do well to make time for Bellocchio's latest.
0,Fresh,"Knows its priorities: to make the legions of High School Musical fans dewy-eyed, toe-tapping, soul-soaring happy, and to pave the way for High School Musical 4."
1,Rotten,"Their chutzpah is admirable, but perhaps, on this occasion, a little misplaced."
0,Fresh,"Everything you could possibly want from a film about a giant gorilla, an enormous wolf and a massive crocodile teaming up to destroy a city."
1,Rotten,McCarthy and first-time director Falcone must have assumed that tossing a drunk and a dunce into a Cadillac would negate the need for a motive or even a script.
0,Fresh,"If you want a feel-good home-grown movie, this is the film for you."
0,Fresh,Could well be considered the most compelling vampire movie made since 1922.
0,Fresh,"You have to be totally open for the experience in order to appreciate and get lost in the weird, wonderful world Julie Taymor creates onscreen..."
1,Rotten,"A flimsy flashback-ridden tale about the importance of friendship, loyalty and the notion that size doesn't matter when it comes to tackling seemingly insurmountable issues."
0,Fresh,"(Eva) Green ... is the main reason to see ""Rise of an Empire."" Her Artemisia is a cold, cruel, merciless and deadly commander who brooks no opposition from anyone, whether it is a subordinate or an enemy."
0,Fresh,Director Iciar Bollain remains such an extraordinary director of actors that in every scene some surprising nuance counters the literalism of the script.
0,Fresh,"At 162 minutes, this sounds like a long film, but the time passes quickly...almost too quickly. A technical and visual masterpiece."
0,Fresh,"The great thing about ""Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage"" is that the documentary enables a new-found respect and regard for an incredibly energetic and creative band that recognize their strength as the sum of their talented parts."
0,Fresh,"In the mayhem-for-minutes stakes, few films can dream to live up to the sheer economy of Roman Polanski's deliciously acid-tongued 79-minute chamber piece."
1,Rotten,A franchise inches toward its conclusion
1,Rotten,A generic action movie that's being released in theatres only because it stars well-known actors. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Even though the movie is a fairly routine popcorn entertainment with typical twists, romances, heroes and villains, it feels old-fashioned, organic, and exciting. It's based on a video game, but you'd never know it."
0,Fresh,"Eventually, Just Mercy finds its rhythm, utilising the talent of its leading men and women and the incredible details of the true story from which it takes its cue, to deliver something that is both moving and engaging."
0,Fresh,"A good deal of the credit goes to actress Jennifer Lawrence, playing the kind of character you start out quietly rooting for, then end up backing, like some World Cup soccer hooligan."
0,Fresh,"Turning its low budget into a self-mocking +, this umpteenth 'Mad Max'-style dystopian actioner delivers trashy fun for genre fans."
0,Fresh,"The Happytime Murders makes that musical look like a Saturday morning cartoon. The level of raunchiness, language and overall tone is off the charts. I kinda loved it!!!"

0,Fresh,Classic Ulmer.
1,Rotten,Yeah...but you have to read the book first.
0,Fresh,"It moves quickly and avoids the bloated running time that has plagued many of these films, it has some nice bits of humor sprinkled throughout and, most importantly, the strong and entertaining Brie Larson performance."
1,Rotten,What are you going to do when your lead actress offers a performance that's as unlikable as the woman she's portraying?
1,Rotten,"Anyone hoping for a stylish, fluid action thriller a la John Wick or Atomic Blonde will be sorely disappointed. Despite the occasional glimmers of style, Red Sparrow flies right past dumb fun and smacks right into dumb."
0,Fresh,"It's simple, but effective and engaging."
0,Fresh,"The film offers one of the most indelible performances of the year: Sandy Martin, playing the frog-throated and chain-smoking Mama Dixon as a beer-swillin' coach potato Machiavelli."
1,Rotten,"Somewhere, Ed Wood is resting pretty comfortably right now."
1,Rotten,"To everyone who bent over backwards to praise Y Tu Mama as raunchy, spicy, sexy, or hot, here's a novel idea -- skip this mild stuff and rent some honest-to-God porn."
0,Fresh,"While his recent movies have only teased us with his greatness, this one offers the full Christopher Walken."
1,Rotten,Marling seems less in danger of creating the same part over and over again than the same movie.
1,Rotten,"Ian McEwan specializes in preposterous plots, and The Children Act is as contrived as anything in his posh, voluminous, award-winning repertoire."
1,Rotten,"One can't blame Colfer for wanting to expand his range, but he's created a character who is neither hero nor villain, in a black comedy that is neither dark nor funny enough."
1,Rotten,"With so many lazy and phoned-in movies out there, it's uniquely frustrating to see Shepard come so close to his lofty goals and still fall short."
1,Rotten,"Allen Hughes may suggest an air of pretty menace, but he does little to make the sequence work as a legible genre scene."
0,Fresh,"Thanks to an extraordinary performance from Michelle Williams and an exceptionally deft hand from her director, this low-budget and loping little film is a genuine heartbreaker."
1,Rotten,"It truly is a modern spin on a classic, in almost all of the worst ways."
1,Rotten,"The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama,' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged."
1,Rotten,One can deduce that boredom and free sex brings [Reeves] back to [Theron] for an extended stay as nothing they do that day can be viewed as earth-shattering.
0,Fresh,"It's uneven and the relationship between your sense of taste and your sense of humour will determine whether you enjoy it, but at its best, Jesus Is Magic doesn't look out of place alongside the best stand-up concert movies."
0,Fresh,The aesthetic flecks are what keep Snowden interesting.
0,Fresh,"There's nothing inherently bad about the special, and it does have a number of entertaining songs."
1,Rotten,It raised my moral outrage heckles in ways I didn't think possible.
1,Rotten,"Relentlessly disturbing though it is, the movie is not particularly frightening."
0,Fresh,"Not merely a documentary portrait, but an engrossing drama with more twists and turns than your average thriller."
0,Fresh,"For all that, an astonishing amount of this movie still works."
1,Rotten,"The Ref works virtually none of the miracles of [Richard LaGravenese's screenplay for The Fisher King,] his previous mix 'n' match effort."
0,Fresh,"Viewed in its entirety, ""Cutie and the Boxer"" is more than a great documentary. It's a great film."
0,Fresh,A staggering work of absolute confidence and absolute uncertainty that endeavors to both embody and crack the great conundrum of faith.
1,Rotten,"Falls flatter than, well, a Hollywood comedy release in January."
1,Rotten,"The lack of new ideas might not matter if the puzzles were fresh or entertaining, but they aren't. Director Renny Harlin has made enjoyably daft movies before, including Cliffhanger and The Long Kiss Goodnight, but here he fails to set our pulses racing."
0,Fresh,"Inside [is] an instant modern classic en francais, along the lines of Haute Tension, Irreversible, and Dans ma Peau. Don't miss it."
0,Fresh,The best-looking film I saw at last year's SXSW.
1,Rotten,"Skyline might be a midnight B-movie, but it's also hopelessly inept and a grievous waste of time and talent with no ending whatsoever."
1,Rotten,Shankman's crassly theatrical attenuation of Hairspray only draws gay culture away from a moment of American history with which it ought to have a great deal in common
1,Rotten,"FRIEDKIN: Kid, I haven't made a decent movie since you were in kindergarten. Hello, The Exorcist? That was it, kid. I pretty much shot my wad with that one."
1,Rotten,Dragon and the Hawk is a weak attempt at capturing the finesse and charm of Chan's films - one that never succeeds.

1,Rotten,It really is too bad that Smith couldn't go back in time and stop this thing.
1,Rotten,"Battle for Terra makes a visually sophisticated break from the usual kid-fare, but the filmmakers have neglected to up the ante in any other respect."
1,Rotten,"Full of witless jokes, dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios, and saddled with a general air of misogyny"
1,Rotten,"Just a good guy, a bad guy, and a clean-cut ending that leaves you shrugging the whole thing off."

1,Rotten,The team does not have the screenplay to match what the cast is giving to it.

0,Fresh,As atuaes de William Hurt e Marlee Matlin so simplesmente inesquecveis.
0,Fresh,"Disappointingly resorts to a reductive dissection of its protagonist in the third reel, but The Grief Tourist benefits from Michael Cudlitz's suitably creepy performance, and is an atmospheric, suspenseful ride."
1,Rotten,Practically bursts at the seams with the same stock characters and cliches you've seen in countless other Inspiring Sports Dramas.
1,Rotten,"Because Noah coyly reserves the motivation for McCanick's vendetta as a third-act twist of sorts, much of McCanick simply involves watching this tortured guy mowing people down for no apparent reason."
0,Fresh,"The new film is more disciplined and less scattershot than Apatow's previous films -- and slightly less funny, too. But only slightly."
0,Fresh,"Stephen Bradley's biopic left me with the abiding impression that Christina found her salvation and that's rare, after all isn't that we're all striving for: salvation whatever that means."
1,Rotten,"""Can we please stop with the remakes of Murder on the Orient Express?"" I ask upon exiting Kenneth Branagh's fatally tepid new reading of the Agatha Christie classic."
0,Fresh,Charles Dickens' affair will be appreciated by Merchant-Ivory fans while others will find the film slow moving.

0,Fresh,"Funny, haunting and thought-provoking."
0,Fresh,"Seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized, quasi-Shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil."
0,Fresh,"screenwriter Nick Hornby understands aimless characters, and his script is a skillful balancing act. It undercuts an overly serious tone whenever possible and layers in a poignancy that rarely seems forced."
1,Rotten,"Overall, the meandering mayhem to the shoddy sequel Scooby Doo 2: Monster's Unleashed is as untested, shaky, and crooked as pesky puppy Scrappy Doo's hind leg"
1,Rotten,"A bleak male-bonding comedy that's a queasy blend of brutal humor and escalating sentimentality, it is overlong, heavy-handed, slow and unpersuasive."
0,Fresh,"Entertaining, horrifying and sort of clear."
1,Rotten,"The biggest problem with ""Into the Ashes"" is the time it wastes on moral dilemmas, when it's clear Nick has only one choice (and just as many shotguns). There is never any doubt where this is going, and the film takes far too long to get there."
1,Rotten,"In this age of sequels, reboots and cinematic universes, maybe all that matters is keeping franchises alive, even if some entries are forgettable. But a lot of recent films seem to keep a series going for more compelling reasons than Jason Bourne."
0,Fresh,Us is a tremendous accomplishment.
0,Fresh,"You may or may not be surprised to learn I do not automatically swoon every time I hear the words 'Star Wars'. But, I'll be damned if I didn't feel a distinctive shiver down my spine watching The Last Jedi."
1,Rotten,"The paper-thin characterisation of its main protagonist is indicative of a well-meaning but shallow approach. Rather than explode, this Bombshell just fizzles out."
1,Rotten,Nothing is less scary than a movie that makes no sense.
1,Rotten,Ben Affleck does not work as a noir tough guy but comes across more like a recent member of the University of Michigan's Alpha Sigma Rho chapter.
0,Fresh,"Though death robbed Krzysztof Kieslowski of the opportunity, substantial contributions from the visually adept Tykwer allowed him to leave us a little slice of ""Heaven."""
0,Fresh,"With no cutaways, the film's story and the momentum of the unlikely robbers seems as unstoppable as the camera. The characters are confused, adrenalinized and breathless, as are you."

1,Rotten,This disappointing War of the Worlds limps to a conclusion that mercifully insures there will not be a sequel.

1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the director defaults with dispiriting frequency to stilted melodrama."
0,Fresh,"From a dramatic standpoint, the film is equally effective in the way that it includes the expected pulpy thrills and weirdo humor but also some unexpectedly affecting dramatic moments."
0,Fresh,"The movie's final battle is pretty awe-inspiring, even if the plight of the human characters is never half as interesting as the showdown between Godzilla and his prey."
0,Fresh,"He has tried to make Georgiana's quest for independence - her attempt to gain power via the media and the Whigs - just as gritty. Against the odds, he mostly succeeds."
1,Rotten,The rest of the laughs (when they eventually arrive; the first half hour is kinda bleak) are mostly scraped from the pit of your roiling stomach.
0,Fresh,...ultimately redeemed by Kevin Bacon's expectedly engrossing performance.
1,Rotten,"Your mileage may vary. If the trailer excites you, you'll probably have an okay time. The Gentlemen won't, however, gain Ritchie any new devotees."
1,Rotten,"Lillard - an actor best-known for his role in ""The Descendants"" - uses the locations well enough, but the result is still a standard coming-of-age picture."
0,Fresh,"Tonally there's so much to appreciate about this production, offering a heightened take on reality without compromising once on the authenticity."
0,Fresh,"Both a torrid exploitation cinema throwback, and a metaphor for a generation of kids screwed over by their elders."
1,Rotten,A mostly preachy but occasionally compelling dramatization of a true story.
1,Rotten,Directed with Sergio Leone sensuality and meager subtlety.
0,Fresh,"There is little insight here beyond showing that comics rely on jokes about sexual organs. And that, like Sandler's career, soon ceases to provide big laughs."
1,Rotten,"The Cats movie did nothing for me except leave me with insane questions. Save yourself and your kids from jellicle nightmares, and skip this one. Meowy Christmas."
0,Fresh,[Director] Kolirin wonderfully maintains an atmosphere of both humor and melancholy.
0,Fresh,A funny film dealing with a serious subject of how two exceptionally smart people cope with dealing with those who don't get it as quickly or succinctly as they do.
1,Rotten,They're 'the worst of the worst.' So's the movie.
1,Rotten,"What a dismal piece of business this is! While Simon Kinberg's chapter of the X-Men saga taps a lot of the familiar notes, this barely memorable slog feels obligatory, a weak step toward the new and hopefully more exciting future."
1,Rotten,The Smurfs contains such moments of sweetness and heart that it's all the more unfortunate that it's otherwise a numbingly ordinary kids' film.
0,Fresh,Another full unfaltering performance by a child. This time it's in a horror film.
0,Fresh,This kids' adventure from Disney is amiable with nice performances.
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, the film rests on [Cotillard's] performance. And there's no better homage to a woman who lived for every time she stepped onto stage."

1,Rotten,"Just another craptacular exercise in weak PG-13 horror involving resourceful-but-stupid teens, idiotic adults and ghostly apparitions with short pants, pale skin and stringy hair."
0,Fresh,"In addition to being a slickly produced and highly entertaining adventure suitable for the whole family, Star Wars is richly evocative of a whole range of old film forms."

1,Rotten,Writer-director Stuart Beattie and his cast and crew tear into their bad idea with vigor.
0,Fresh,"Howard creates an immersive, gorgeously shot experience pitting man against beast in the ocean for the film's most spectacular scenes, which are reminiscent of old-school scope of Mutiny on the Bounty and other watery adventures of yesteryear."
0,Fresh,The brave and unflinching performance of Giovanna Mezzogiorno is the foundation upon which the bedrock of Vincere rests. She's the heart and soul of the film.

1,Rotten,"Pointless, atrocious on every level and gives horror films a bad name."
1,Rotten,"There's not a whole lot to like about Welcome to Mooseport, and, considering how lively real politics can be these days, you're likely to get more entertainment from watching two hours of CSPAN."
0,Fresh,"John Dies At The End sometimes strains to live up to its midnight-movie reputation, but not every B-horror picture combines demonic creatures and ultra-violence with musings about what it means to be alive in a world that's getting more unreal by the day."
1,Rotten,"Just like the new Star Wars trilogy before it, my youth has been raped once more by another large man sporting a beard. Thankfully this one doesn't wear flannel."
1,Rotten,Political humor is a mainstay in this country's conversation about issues that affect us all. But the minute you get preachy is the minute your little satire souffl falls.

0,Fresh,"If you're looking for a hefty serving of rude fun with a side of light meaning, order up Waiting."
0,Fresh,"Despite its clumsy first-act emphasis on exposition and excessive length, the story is important and Dern deserves a nomination for almost single-handedly saving the film with her committed and engaging performance."
0,Fresh,"While this may not go down as a classic like ""Big,"" it's a transformational film that tackles themes Hollywood has been too timid with for too long."
0,Fresh,"Certainly worth seeing -- it's the class act to close the summer -- but the film misses some crucial charge, an innate energy that was in the book that didn't translate to the movie."
0,Fresh,"It's the worst the franchise has to offer, but it's still a good time. Keanu seems a little bored, but Winter is on point."
0,Fresh,"Fun, but not in the same league as Superman."

1,Rotten,"All singing, all dancing, all color: Rio 2 is a modern, studio animation blockbuster spilling all over the place, rather than arching into the sky."
0,Fresh,Its high-mindedness has obscured the thriller's basic function -- to deliver thrills.
0,Fresh,"A wild ride, and worth the ticket price if only for the first-rate special effects. There's enough visionary work here to hold your attention for all 130 minutes."
0,Fresh,"Beginning with Mean Streets, Judas has loomed large in Scorsese's work. With Silence, he's working toward his own Gospel of Judas."
0,Fresh,It's not preachy at all... but it is making this statement about social media... the movie captures a lot of ugly moments that we become familiar with.
1,Rotten,"Were the articulate director a less obnoxious presence, he might have just pulled off his audaciously self-conscious endeavor."
0,Fresh,"See, instead of existing in a vacuum like most horror flicks where nothing of real worth can ever seep in, Mulberry Street insists on embracing all those little lifelike details."
1,Rotten,"I am a man. I am straight. I really liked the TV show. I am tired of this shtick. And no Samantha, I didn't just say dick."
0,Fresh,"...the lightest and most traditional of the movies, for good or bad."
0,Fresh,"What saves it ... and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks, is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense, such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist Alice."
1,Rotten,"This is not a real plot, and because it wastes so much time trying to convince us that it is, Transporter 3 isn't any fun."
0,Fresh,[A] gently existentialist buddy movie.
0,Fresh,"[Lily James]'s energy infuses every scene in which she appears, and she, unexpectedly as well as thankfully, out-sings Meryl Streep."

0,Fresh,A middle-of-the-road yet somewhat entertaining drama...
1,Rotten,You can put as much gloss on top of the shaky foundations and wooden acting as possible but as soon becomes apparent - you can't varnish a turd.
0,Fresh,"These are not merely pulsing, pulpy action sequences; they are also illustrative extensions of a vibrant character study."
1,Rotten,"Ray's relaxed, open style had a tremendous influence on the film world of 1956, but time has absorbed some of its originality."
1,Rotten,"Carol Morley's film wants to blow our minds, but it succeeds only at rousing our boredom."
1,Rotten,The paranoid thriller unfolds at a tedious pace and seems to take forever to develop.
1,Rotten,"We've seen it all before. Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers."

0,Fresh,The acting of Bob Hoskins in Jordan's disturbing Odd Couple tale is superb.
0,Fresh,"The defiantly lo-fi ""Prospect"" is a smartly entertaining throwback that doesn't need a Marvel movie's worth of CGI to make its point."

1,Rotten,"Harmless for kids, painless for adults, but just good enough for you to wish it was ""good."""
0,Fresh,"While Tom McCarthy's beautifully crafted film about the Boston Globe investigation of the sex abuse in the Church is very much of a time and place, it also couldn't be more important now."
0,Fresh,"A spectacularly sleazy send-up that finds the puckish, thin-skinned director confronting his critics and doubling down on everything that upstanding, respectable people hate about Brian De Palma films."
0,Fresh,"The spicy pre-Code dialogue adds to the merriment, but the selling point is the decision to end the picture with not one, not two, but three production numbers."

1,Rotten,"[Lautner's] not a terrible actor, but if he wants a career after the Twilight fades, he'll pick better films."
1,Rotten,"If you do see the flick, stay for the closing credits, when Stiller offers a loose stand-up routine. Now that could have been a movie!"

1,Rotten,"like one of the characters at the film's masked ball, The Princess And The Frog is the Disney film that pretends not to be a Disney film, but in the end cannot help lowering its mask and reverting to type."
0,Fresh,A handsome and extremely well-constructed gangster pic.
0,Fresh,Cinderella Man captures the essence of the Braddock experience. Crowe confirms himself as the new Brando. Ready to respect Opie yet?
0,Fresh,This is a Class A comedy about Class B drugs. It has a Rizla-thin plot but Camberwell-carrot sized laughs.
0,Fresh,Interesting throughout with an intriguing female slant not seen in most steamy psycho-thrillers.
0,Fresh,"A warm and fuzzy sendup of Reagan-era action-film iconography, it's sort of like what might happen if Cheech and Chong played Tango and Cash."
0,Fresh,"The filmmaker finds a way to pay homage to a lesser-known, valiant figure, sympathetically portrayed through Robinson's witty performance."
0,Fresh,"A half-compelling, half-goofy and half-redundant piece of remake revisionism. (Yes, that's three halves, but it's that weird a movie.)"
0,Fresh,"As satisfying as it is stimulating, 'Secretariat' will make you stand up and cheer."
0,Fresh,"Paul is slacker than the duo's previous efforts, but the gags still come thick and fast."
1,Rotten,a comedy whose very first visual gag is overpowered by implausibility and whose 'heroine' is an unsympathetic wacko instead of being given the feminist revenge bent that might have worked.
0,Fresh,Cinematic coups abound
1,Rotten,A disappointingly routine horror movie spoof that follows the well-worn path of the Scream and Scary Movie franchises.
0,Fresh,"Bergman fans will discover that it's not a typical film of his, and is rather more realistic than his later films, and some would call it ""minor."" But by any standards, it's an excellent film, gorgeously made and emotionally powerful."
0,Fresh,"An ingenious fable, screenwriter Ross's directorial debut playfully spoofs the small-minded lifestyle idealised by 'family values' advocates, and the intolerance and insecurity underlying that ideal."
0,Fresh,"Renner is on good form here (and rocking a hard-to-pull-off pair of dungarees) as the sensitive, protective Cory, and as a genre exercise, it works."

0,Fresh,"Appropriately and effectively creepy, the film had me going for a long time, trying to figure out what the explanation and/or surprise was going to be."
1,Rotten,Ben Kinsley gives me the creeps in these intense roles and this film is no exception.
1,Rotten,"Feeble posturing, asinine pop psychology and political analysis charged with all the cynicism of a mollycoddled teen dropout in fake Oakleys and a home customised Linkin Park tee."
0,Fresh,"""Marwencol"" is inspiring but also insightful because it refuses to gloss over complex, even discomfiting questions surrounding its endearing but troubled central character."
1,Rotten,"Exhausting, pretentious, and tedious. It's one of the most painfully boring, overlong and disappointing Westerns since Heaven's Gate."
1,Rotten,It's hard to feel sorry for someone who seems to instigate so many of his own problems.
1,Rotten,"As a director, Stephen Berra makes this all quite palatable, but as a writer, he frequently mistakes platitudes for profundity."
1,Rotten,I can't recommend the film although it does have its moments.
0,Fresh,"Director John Frankenheimer has moved his cameras out onto the great tracks of the Grand Prix circuit -- Monaco; Spa, Belgium; Brands Hatch, England; and Monza, Italy -- for the most authentic and exciting racing sequences ever filmed."

0,Fresh,An enjoyable portrait of a prickly friendship between two men of vastly different temperaments...
0,Fresh,Fun ride from Russell.
0,Fresh,What emerges is a high-school movie that is remarkably enthralling and complex. A quietly outstanding microcosm of modern society that's anything but ABC.
1,Rotten,"The original was blissfully simple: alien sadist messes with the wrong dude. Here, nothing adds up."
0,Fresh,"Franco could have easily just played Wiseau's eccentricities for laughs, but he sheds a little light on the man, making the audience care about him."

0,Fresh,"There are movies in this world that aren't meant to do anything except give you a sense of pure happiness, and that's Bill & Ted Face the Music."
1,Rotten,The underwhelming end result is an all too predictable film that undeniably delivers a bang but also an awful lot of whimper.
0,Fresh,"Director Marc Webb's debut feature is as far from a Sandra Bullock or Hugh Grant vehicle as you can imagine. What better reason to go see it? From start to end his subtle movie feather-teases your funny spots: it amazes, refreshes and it delights."
1,Rotten,"Where are the signature chase scenes, the sexual humor and the romantic trysts that we come to Bond films for in the first place?"
0,Fresh,"Stan Lee might not approve, but the script, by newcomer Paul Hernandez and Kim Possible creators Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, gets off some good lines"
1,Rotten,"We've all been waiting around for them to give us another Matrix, but as the last 15 years-15 years!-have ground on, it has becoming increasingly clear that they learned the wrong lesson from that movie's success."
0,Fresh,"Gripping while it lasts, but will be hard to remember in the morning."
1,Rotten,Let down by a script that's not funny enough and a plot that's so formula it came from a baby's bottle.
0,Fresh,"It's easy to forgive the thudding omens and ironies, since they appear in such a life-affirming context. The purpose of La Bamba is not to mourn Valens's death but to celebrate his life, with special attention to the great joy he found in music."
1,Rotten,"A generic medieval action epic on a tight budget, filled with garish CGI clutter and ironically bloodless violence."
0,Fresh,"While Silence is a very tough sit, one that succeeds in raising very uncomfortable questions about faith, loyalty and the limits of both, it stands out as a cinematic achievement (Splice Today)"
1,Rotten,"Exposition is poorly executed, genuine laughs come infrequently and you quickly lose confidence that the filmmakers even understand what their basic joke is."
0,Fresh,"Along with Space Jam and Hoop Dreams, it joins the roster of passable net-flicks."
0,Fresh,Funny as hell!
1,Rotten,"Goes out of its way to avoid being funny -- backs actors into corners, restricting them from using their natural talent."
0,Fresh,Probably the most delightful thing about The Lighthouse is that it gives Willem Dafoe the role of a lifetime.

0,Fresh,... has a sincerity and an authenticity that creates a bittersweet portrait of aging and lifelong devotion.
0,Fresh,Chamber of Secrets is fairly fun despite its length.
1,Rotten,"Queen of the Desert has the note of a travelogue about it -- that is to say, it feels well-travelled, but not well-lived."
0,Fresh,"'American Hustle' is smart, sophisticated and slick. Director David O. Russell has been nominated for the Academy Award for both last year's 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'The Fighter,' and he's bound to earn at least a nod again this year."
0,Fresh,Dench and co-writer Steve Coogan share a fabulous chemistry on screen; they can ride waves of dialogue that take them from seemingly insignificant topics into questioning the existence of God and back again.
1,Rotten,"Shirin isn't believable either as a product of her parents or as a romantic interest for either Mike or William, and since the movie can't sell those core relationships, it can't convince us of anything."
0,Fresh,"A crowd-pleaser about chronic, multi-generational irresponsibility."
0,Fresh,Barson's documentary is as much a celebration as it is a study of this long career in comedy
1,Rotten,"Nothing more than a tired, familiar and characterless genre installment with only the impressive contortions of Bonnie Morgan to recommend it."
1,Rotten,It isn't cute. It isn't really funny. It just kind of is.
0,Fresh,The real stars of this film are the music (big surprise) and the hard- edged working-class (and lower) settings in northern Dublin.
0,Fresh,A brilliantly naturalistic dissection of romance and marriage...meticulously observed [and] intensely realistic.
1,Rotten,"Frustratingly, there are decent gags -- suggesting writers were present, but just told to hurry up."
0,Fresh,"Director Fincher knows atmosphere, and atmosphere is what you get."
0,Fresh,"Oceans 8 is a light, fun, moderately twisty addition."
1,Rotten,"Like a video game once played, tends to disappear from one's memory bank as soon as it's finished."
1,Rotten,"The dialogue is excruciatingly bad, the lead performances never quite gel and it eventually becomes clear that the flashy direction is masking a lack of substance."
0,Fresh,"The intensity is brutal, like relentless horror movies where even the survivors, if there are any, still go through hell."
1,Rotten,"The technology is state-of-the-art, but the people around it are far from state-of-the-heart."
0,Fresh,"A tender, fascinating documentary by Matt Wolf, will delight the cult and instantly convert new members."
0,Fresh,A pretty darned good film!
0,Fresh,007's silver screen debut. Not for young kids.
0,Fresh,"The slow-paced film includes all the expected social themes - drinking, poverty, broken families. Where Zhao excels is in the range of emotions she gets from a mostly nonprofessional cast."
1,Rotten,"This one's for die-hard genre fans only. And even then, it's only good to snicker at the obvious cliches and overall predictablity."
0,Fresh,"Most fairy tales are rooted first in nightmares, and if this story is any indication, there are plenty of those haunting the people of Mumbai."
0,Fresh,"Three-fifths of a great film, this stylish, Glasgow-based, Danish-inspired stalker drama does not deliver on its promise."
0,Fresh,"Whether or not Baena does right by Boccaccio, he definitely does right by Aubrey Plaza, his girlfriend and indie comedy's reigning queen of mean."
0,Fresh,"As good as the action scenes are, the humanity in [Will] Smith's performance is most responsible for I Am Legend's success."
1,Rotten,"It's still a dumb movie with pretty, wooden actors, but 20 years on Starship Troopers has more ambition than it was given credit for."
0,Fresh,"The bickering dialogue rings true and Maoz creates a suitably claustrophobic atmosphere within the tank that works well, even if the story tries to pack in a little too much."
1,Rotten,A garish supernatural story.
1,Rotten,The first four letters say it all.
0,Fresh,"Miss Sloane is a smart, thorough film about a rare subject that is also as breathless, broad, and crowd-pleasing as your standard Grisham thriller."
0,Fresh,"...just funny enough, but not because of star Steve Carell."
0,Fresh,"An amazing, singular film experience."
1,Rotten,"With Sarah Marshall, Stoller made audiences hungry for more Aldous Snow; after Get Him to the Greek, they'll be happy never to see the guy again."
0,Fresh,"With its expert use of dissolves and pans, Hard Target is an arty shot of adrenaline to this overworked genre."
0,Fresh,It's in movies like the ribald but surprisingly endearing sex comedy Don Jon that Gordon-Levitt has connected best with audiences.

1,Rotten,"Sympathy is a dollar that can only be stretched so far, and it gives out halfway through the movie."
1,Rotten,"Though camp at its best flirts with amateurism, and even failure, this production does more than flirt; it pretty much goes all the way to disaster."
0,Fresh,"It feels more like an assignment fulfilled than a passion pursued. But craft this strong - and, despite the tonal uncertainty, true - should not be taken for granted."
0,Fresh,"A hugely creative, fast-paced romp that will keep both children and their parents thoroughly entertained."
0,Fresh,"... a high-end spread of juicy cinematic treats [that] occasionally ... bites off a little more than it can chew, cinematically speaking."
1,Rotten,"I chuckled once, but that lone laugh was sadly neither big nor fat."
0,Fresh,You could describe this delirious erotic fantasy as a stag film reworking of Teorema as directed by Alain Resnais.
0,Fresh,"Una historia profundamente humana en la que el director no teme escarbar en sus propios fantasmas. Christopher Plummer se adueña de su personaje de una manera tierna y conmovedora, que le valió el Oscar como mejor actor de reparto."
0,Fresh,"A n exceptionally well-made, incredibly entertaining and -- dare I say it -- marvelous superhero movie."
0,Fresh,"Manages a pretty fair portrait of Van Zandt and his personal demons, pressures and joys."
1,Rotten,"The story of one man's inner self-discovery during his time in India, Outsourced is a fish-out-of-water tale of the distinctly white and schmucky kind."
0,Fresh,"The film inserts us into a solipsistic universe of Norman Lear, one that also overlaps many of the most significant social, political, and show-biz issues of the second half of the 20th century."
0,Fresh,"Superbly evocative, deeply stirring."
1,Rotten,"The film runs out of steam by revealing too much, too soon."

0,Fresh,"The film claims to be an introduction, but it's really a long series of conclusions."
0,Fresh,"The filmmakers don't pretend T2 doesn't live in the shadow of the original. Fortunately, they play on that."
1,Rotten,"With many cooks in the writing, this CGI adventure is structurally disjointed and dramatically uninvolving, and the chemistry between reliable star Cage and charming Baruchel is not strong, which explains why the producers stress the literary pedigree."
1,Rotten,"Definitely better than DeVito's last movie, the disastrous Death to Smoochy. Alas, it's not nearly as good as his two films from which it takes its obvious inspiration: The War of the Roses and Throw Momma From the Train."
1,Rotten,"When the eponymous couple is together, 'Amira & Sam' is an earnest and considerate examination of two people falling in love, but the movie lacks certainty when handling these characters separately."
0,Fresh,A suspense-filled dark comedy about a doctor obsessed with an 18-year-old patient.
0,Fresh,"If you liked the previous four movies, there's little reason why you won't find at least a few things to enjoy in this one, but it's definitely getting to the point where it's dubious whether they can keep it going much longer..."
0,Fresh,"Boy doesn't give in to the kind of sappy sentimentality most films like to lap up and barf out. Instead, this solid, smart comedy remains calm, classy and funny, as Grant gives the ladies another reason to fall for him."
0,Fresh,"It's not complicated, but it's a satisfying 88-minute drama driven by [Mel] Gibson's undimmed star power."
1,Rotten,"While pretty and often entertaining, Gangster Squad's a violent urban western that gets lost in the fog of homage."
0,Fresh,"Loose-jointed and openhearted, a wink of reassurance in our age of anxiety, it's that rare comedy that may actually play better in the living room than it does in the theater."
0,Fresh,"Jesse Eisenberg, Melissa Leo, and Tracy Morgan make an unlikely but entertaining trio in this frantic shaggy-dog story."
0,Fresh,"There are so many twists and turns as one revelation after another reshapes the truth that ""The Past"" begins to feel contrived, like an art house soap opera."
0,Fresh,"While What Keeps You Alive strains credibility on more than a couple of occasions, the cat and mouse machinations which kick in after the film's early devastating plot twist make for a highly watchable genre exercise."
1,Rotten,"Porn industry 1, Henry James 0."
0,Fresh,"Even at its most mechanistic ... From Nowhere largely avoids preachiness and sanctimony, preferring to wrestle with the real world in all its stubborn complexity."
1,Rotten,"A cheap, quick-fix horror sequel that methodically destroys its predecessor's shaky appeal."
1,Rotten,"Tart and weightless, and it entertains without leaving a mark. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but at 85 minutes, The Valet at times feels like a blueprint for a farce rather than the farce itself."
0,Fresh,"Corbet is a major new talent, whose future promise seems without boundaries"
0,Fresh,Wardle's approach suffers from the documentarian's anxiety over holding a mainstream audience's attention...But I credit him with bringing organization and coherence to a complicated and immensely compelling story.
1,Rotten,"If your idea of a gut-busting good time at the multiplex is to see Jackman clown around with a pair of testicles on his neck, accidentally dipping them in butter and slapping them on the head of a baby, then Movie 43 is pure gold."
1,Rotten,Mortensen as Lane's clandestine love interest is nothing but a symbol of beauty and freedom.
1,Rotten,"A Guy Thing is only a slight improvement over Down to You but is actually more of a disappointment, considering that in the ensuing years, its young stars have moved on to better things."
0,Fresh,"It might not spawn a new series of masked killer movies, but it certainly shows its adoration for them throughout the movie. It also has a beat, and you can dance to it."
0,Fresh,"It seems less a commercial strategy by the Wachowskis as a philosophical one: to incorporate as many forms of communication and color-blind ethnicity as possible, much as they did with the Matrix pictures."
1,Rotten,It's mean-spirited and largely unnecessary.
0,Fresh,George Miller orchestrates the rubber-burning pandemonium with the illicit smirk of someone who knows he's giving us exactly what we want
1,Rotten,"Screenplay by young Dmitry Sobolev, a student at Moscow's VGIK film school, has a familiar, almost folksy structure, making for satisfying storytelling but leaving viewers with less to ponder after the story's final, largely foreseeable twist."
1,Rotten,"Sands executive produced the movie and wrote the narration, and his doggedness forces the film to be one thing and one thing only: a sort of cinematic intervention for Horst Von Wchter."

0,Fresh,"Slight but entertaining, Hitchcock's last silent film/first talkie (it was released both ways) is today largely a historical curiosity, but still worth seeing."
0,Fresh,"Screenwriter Amy Fox, who expanded her 30-minute play of the same name into a feature film at the request of Merchant Ivory, shows a talent for creating multidimensional characters with both clear and intriguing motivations."
0,Fresh,"As a filmmaker, in Herzog's opinion, Treadwell was without equal. But as a naturalist, well, let's just say that his canteen had sprung a leak."
0,Fresh,"And although essentially a fable, the film reminds us that the world is a complicated place and none of us are in any position to judge someone solely on their appearance or past actions - as tempting as that often might be."
1,Rotten,"It's a pity the film's machismo and aggro dominates proceedings because occasionally, but not often enough, some involving elements counter the film's relentlessness."
0,Fresh,The film's urgent point about the need for understanding is made with dignity and an appreciable tinge of sorrow.
0,Fresh,"[Close's] role is a juicy one, but she capitalises on it brilliantly, and while Bjorn Runge's film feels a little theatrical at times, the acting from Close and her co-stars more than compensates."
0,Fresh,"This is not genius, but it's very good indeed."
1,Rotten,Many people said John Huston was an odd choice to direct Annie and he proves them right.
0,Fresh,"Despite some B movie residue, in the novelty of the premise and no shortage of 'bump in the night' spooks, it is pro-human and pro-intellectual, reinterpreting 'survival of the fittest' as 'survival of the smartest'."
0,Fresh,"There are echoes of classics like Hell In The Pacific in Tracker and the seesawing relationship between the two men is entertainingly handled, if repetitive, until some welcome 11th-hour twists in the plot."
0,Fresh,"Krippendorf's Tribe, a surprisingly enjoyable piece of piffle, is pure Disney all the way, replete with a wholly preposterous plot, engaging performances and a feel-good, lesson-teaching ending."
1,Rotten,"As virtual tourism, it's a success but as dramatic fare it's a distinctly thin bowl of zuppa."
0,Fresh,"The film's second half is the most touching, because it shows that our lives are not merely our own, but also belong to the events we set in motion."
0,Fresh,"A faithful, loving piece of work."
1,Rotten,"Substituting titillating triumph for tragedy, this adaptation of Marvel Comics' knife-wielding knockout comes across as hopelessly blunted."

1,Rotten,"Truly awful, though I'll never get tired of Patrick Stewart a'slummin'."
1,Rotten,But in the end it makes a lot of noise about challenging genre stereotypes and clichés but then is too lazy and simple-minded to do anything but fall victim to them.
0,Fresh,"""Vulgar"" is as far away from ""Jay and Silent Bob"" as you could possibly imagine, so if you are going to watch the film, try and forget there was ever a Jay, a Bob, a Dante, a Holden, a Banky and a woman named Amy, and you might get something a little more"

0,Fresh,"So smoothly plotted and layered with surprises that you might well figure out one or two of its mysteries along the way, but you'll still be guessing until its final moments."
1,Rotten,"Why don't they just pick that day annually to stay under the covers and let fate blow over? They could save themselves a soap opera's worth of stilted heartache, drug addiction, family issues, divorce, death and generic romantic hokum."
1,Rotten,"Seagal the director shows that he has picked up the odd trick or two from the action specialists who made his name, but his impassioned green speeches will have viewers reaching for the remote control."
1,Rotten,"The solitary Ghost Dog remains too remote a figure to sustain much interest, and certain elements of the film do not fit well together."
0,Fresh,"""Taxi to the Dark Side"" takes a vast and potentially confusing subject and discovers the simple truths that have been largely obscured in a mass of details, sloppy reporting and general disinterest."
0,Fresh,"It is brutal, relentless, nihilistic, violent, terrifying, relentless, psychopathic, and yet it is so powerful, so explosively febrile, it compels you to watch and keep watching."
0,Fresh,With uneven if generally charming results ... [it] straddles the fine line between outrageous farce and heartfelt romance.
0,Fresh,"There is a degree of outrage [in] the movie, but there is no passion in that outrage...the characters had it but the movie didn't."
1,Rotten,"Worlds don't so much collide as politely bump into each other in [this] glossy, well-meaning but dramatically listless study of class relations in contemporary Paris."
0,Fresh,"a throwback to the urban-paranoia thrillers of the late 1960s and the early 1970s, such as 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Possession of Joel Delaney'..."
1,Rotten,"It is overly heavy -- at least an hour-and-a-half of its two-and-a-half-hour running time is spent with its heroine in abject heartbreak and depression, and that's when her friends aren't experiencing same."
1,Rotten,"Only Brooke Smith is distinctive as supporting player Cassie. Amanda Peet is a natural for Woody's style, but is saddled with one of Allen's most cliched characters"
1,Rotten,"Though a web is one of nature's most fascinating spectacles, watching a spider weave one can be less than thrilling."

1,Rotten,The Fast and Furious franchise hits its nadir with this overlong and aggressively over-the-top entry...
0,Fresh,"""Tallulah"" is one of those films on a filmmaker's resume that denotes promise more than accomplishment."
0,Fresh,"""We Are the Best!"" is a messy, congenial empowerment story that knows how aggravating adolescence can be when you refuse to fit in."
0,Fresh,"Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by."
0,Fresh,"A charming, uplifting rom-com with a surprising emotional wallop...a salty, gentle gem that's filled with engaging sea shanties."
0,Fresh,An entertaining comedy that far surpasses his previous American films.
1,Rotten,"Blood Ties comes off as a weird, misshapen version of a '70s-style thriller-almost as if it's lacking contemporary examples to follow."
1,Rotten,"Visual effect supervisor-turned first time director Bradley Parker quickly runs out of creative ideas, making this disaster-tourism trip well worth avoiding."
0,Fresh,The acting is good and the plot is intense; if you work hard you will find some entertainment.
0,Fresh,"A beguiling, effervescent deconstruction of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl subgenre by way of Stranger Than Fiction, with both charm and a certain psychological heft."
0,Fresh,"Miss Juneteenth isn't trying to make grand proclamations about what it means to be Black in America today. The film is too smart for such grandstanding. Instead, it revels in watching Black folks just be."
1,Rotten,"The direction drags, the performances are uneven and there's a strong sense that the fictionalised story is less interesting than the reality."
0,Fresh,"Leave No Trace asks all sorts of interesting questions about the nature of society and the rights of the individual versus the supposed common good. It looks tremendous, and is wonderfully acted by McKenzie and Foster."
1,Rotten,"The action scenes with fighting robots are amazing and I'd say they upped the ante again. But if Bay knows that's all we came for, why do we have to wade through another 90 minutes of insulting lowest-common-denominator stuff just to enjoy those scenes?"

1,Rotten,Robin Hood is a bland film and by trying to appear so respectable it has lost most of the charm of the original folklore.
0,Fresh,"""Rampart"" is engrossing enough to forgive them, settling into a culture of corruption where the rough edges of the frame resemble the fraying image of the once noble profession Brown comes to represent."
0,Fresh,"Throughout, writer-director Ani Simon-Kennedy keeps The Short History of the Long Road in gear - but a lower, slower one than you might expect."
1,Rotten,"A competent but hardly rousing piece of effects-spectacle entertainment in which Sam Worthington exudes the yep-I'm-here charisma of a middleweight Steve Reeves stand-in. Terrible 3-D, too."
1,Rotten,The film's story remains as defiantly impervious to logic as its hero is to bullets.
0,Fresh,One of the most powerful I have ever seen. The film's score and editing will haunt you for years to come.
1,Rotten,"Weak, uninspiring and tame, political satirist Jon Stewart makes a mediocre directorial debut with Rosewater."

0,Fresh,An extraordinary inspection of a universe rarely invaded by motion picture cameras. You've never been here before.
0,Fresh,"In the Valley of Elah offers a fine example of a mutually beneficial pairing of filmmaker and actor. Director and co-screenwriter Paul Haggis gives Tommy Lee Jones a great role. In exchange, Jones supplies Haggis with nuance."
1,Rotten,"It looks good, has some talented people behind the mic, and is visually engaging, but there's nothing memorable about the script at all. The 3D may pop, but the story is flat."
0,Fresh,"Their enthusiasm alone makes the journey one worth taking, even if you never felt much like wading in the Ganges yourself."
0,Fresh,"Take the plot of Billy Elliot, toss in the ethnic spice of Monsoon Wedding and you have a pretty good idea where Bend It Like Beckham is headed."
1,Rotten,"There is only one word needed to sum up Invictus -- underwhelming. While the historically significant story is certainly worthy of a film adaptation, Invictus is little more than a clichd sports drama, and a rather stale one at that."
0,Fresh,"The first act is glacial, the extended universe connections weak and the entire concept and execution of L3 abysmal. But Ron Howard's cliffhanger confidence in the action and the smoky, alluring cinematography from Bradford Young carry it through."
1,Rotten,"Begins with legal procedure and concludes like a Blumhouse production, working swiftly and steadily to give viewers the very least when it comes to a moviemaking effort."
0,Fresh,Courtenay and Rampling have left it late to deliver possibly the most devastatingly telling performances of their careers. His doddering detachment provokes icy fury while she take passive aggression to new heights.

0,Fresh,Maudie would be captivating even if the title character had never painted a lick.
0,Fresh,"The film's well-judged moments of horror and violence are charged with terror and moral abandon, perfect counterpoints to the safety and security Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) is seeking for herself and her petrified little cousin."
1,Rotten,"With all of the superficial style but none of the rousing spirit of the source material, Fuqua's film is less The Magnificent Seven, more The Perfunctory Few."

0,Fresh,"One of the year's smartest, boldest blockbusters, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 treats its audience with respect and assumes we have high expectations - and it more than delivers the goods."
0,Fresh,"It must be said that the film offers a soaring conclusion. The story may get a bit lost in its own hundred-acre wood, but it finds its way home eventually."

0,Fresh,It's effort like this that makes Bad Neighbours that much more entertaining and not just a lazy hodgepodge of sex and stoner gags.
1,Rotten,Great title for a gangster flick. Too bad that writer-director Guy Ritchie only partially realizes the sizzling potential.
0,Fresh,"A slathering, rabid beast of a movie, Neds is a hellish trip through 70s Glasgow as seen through the eyes of a teenage ne'er-do-well."
1,Rotten,"Envy's horrid mix of poorly done black comedy and the incessant striving to be zany by Black, Stiller, and former Upright Citizens Brigade member Poehler makes Death to Smoochy look like a masterpiece of comic nuance."
0,Fresh,"Canadian filmmaker Jason Eisener's homage to grindhouse movies past is a pitch-perfect recreation of the brutal, low-budget crime films of the '70s, which is simultaneously the best and the worst thing about it."
0,Fresh,"Dexter Fletcher doesn't overplay the cowboy angle. Instead, he puts most of his efforts into creating a believable dynamic between the father and his sons, and it's in this tangled skein of shyness, suspicion, loyalty and love that the film's heart lies."
0,Fresh,"The longtime aficionado of Kaufman's work might suspect there's more up his sleeve, only to find themselves disappointed."
0,Fresh,"The movie, for all its sincerity, becomes clinical and repetitious, though its unsparing vision of the fragility of identity can give you a shudder."

0,Fresh,A radiant Vanessa Redgrave heads an almost perfect cast in this unabashedly romantic movie
1,Rotten,"[Captive State is] off-brand Blomkamp, a movie that is reminiscent of that director's work without quite rising to his level of execution...an adequate piece of sci-fi entertainment with occasional whispers of greater possibility."
0,Fresh,"The movie doesn't have three brain cells to rub together, but the premise carries it a long way."
1,Rotten,"There's a great story at the heart of Matej Minac's documentary ""Nicky's Family,"" if only it were allowed to be told unvarnished."

0,Fresh,"Some of the writing was uneven, but the direction of all four pieces in XX was competent, and the acting impressive was throughout. I really enjoyed the interstitial animated pieces by Sofia Carrilo."
1,Rotten,"As messy in conception as in its bloody mise en scène, it's the first misstep in her career."
0,Fresh,"Sometimes dull and mostly uninspired, it's much less a satisfying reboot like ""Batman Begins'' than a pointless rehash in the mode of ""Superman Returns.''"
1,Rotten,"Von Trier's previous sorties into torturing the audience ...were structured around issues of faith, God ... and the human condition. This time around, however, the thrust is either incoherent or so complex as to require a sharper mind than my own."
0,Fresh,Comradeship remains a hopeful and progressive testament on solidarity from the revered Pabst.

0,Fresh,"Writer/director Armando Iannucci hits home so brilliantly in what is essentially a big-screen version of TV's The Thick Of It. The Sneak cannot overuse the word ""funny"" enough to describe In The Loop. It is funny, funny, funny."

1,Rotten,"Through each storyline pivot, the focus is lost, and it never reclaims any footing it may have had in the first place."
1,Rotten,"This period drama shows how awful it was to be a working-class woman at that time... [but] scenes dramatizing the political organizing and protests are less effective, bogged down by pedantic dialogue and historical generalizations."
0,Fresh,Kid Movie...Shmid Movie. This flick is funny!
1,Rotten,"Set and filmed on location in bustling Hong Kong, the tight urban street and winding alleyways suit the film perfectly, but this is not enough to save Push from the Oscar season garbage dump."

1,Rotten,'The Rise of Skywalker' is the Weakest and Most Unengaging Installment of the New Trilogy
0,Fresh,silly in a memorable way.
1,Rotten,"The whole film is as graceless, lurid and unnecessary as a Stallone painting - but without the winning naivety."

1,Rotten,So incompetently crafted that it makes the Saturday-morning cartoons seem like Disney classics.
0,Fresh,Enough Said is a lovely coda to an actor whose career was cut short to soon. 
0,Fresh,"Writer-director Oliver Stone, who shows an uncanny knack for anticipating public interest in the subjects he chooses, explores the much-publicized inside trading scandals of the mid-1980s."
0,Fresh,That rare remake that paves its own way without exploiting or cheapening its predecessor.
1,Rotten,It is likely to test the patience of many viewers.
1,Rotten,"As much as I would like to applaud a movie for challenging kids not to take what adults say to them at face value, Smallfoot just left me cold."
0,Fresh,The film's surreal pacing and meandering plot require viewers to hang on tight or risk being left behind. Suspension of disbelief won't cut it -- you'll need to actually demolish it if you want to keep up with the humour.
1,Rotten,"Despite its relative bravery in choosing not to embrace the Grand Guignol, Splice is a little too hit-or-miss to truly work."
1,Rotten,"A wasted opportunity: put the two leads in a movie that didn't lazily rely on its high concept to do the work, and you'd really have something to laugh about."
1,Rotten,"a totally weird path, but one that's easy to mentally traverse despite the strangeness"

0,Fresh,"has quite a bit to impart about the trauma of betrayal, but also the power of forgiveness"
1,Rotten,"Let's hope Branagh was well-compensated, at least. To quote his favorite author: No profit grows where is no pleasure taken."
0,Fresh,...a powerful bit of agitprop...
1,Rotten,M. Night Shyamalan's 2016 film Split takes abuse-as-character to a logical and absurd extreme.
0,Fresh,...the film does remain watchable throughout - mostly due to Ford's ingratiating performance.
1,Rotten,"While an intriguing political thriller, it disappointingly lacks the atmosphere of Roman Polanski's previous masterpieces."
0,Fresh,"Featuring a few beautiful scenes that will probably warm the heart of the most hardened cynic, Dolphin Tale 2 makes for some wholesome family fare."
0,Fresh,"Oldman's Star Shines Bright in ""Darkest Hour."""
0,Fresh,"It's a movie in which you can feel the spirit of the material infusing the filmmaker both as an artist and as a human being, and what results is that thing that occurs when even the simplest of songs sends sparks to the soul."
1,Rotten,...there were also moments when I was actually bored.
0,Fresh,"The movie still feels like a play, but Ron Howard's version is smooth, skillful, superbly acted (Frank Langella's turn is Oscar-worthy) and it commands attention to intelligent arguments and intriguing personalities."
1,Rotten,What happens to these not-so-interesting people isn't nearly as compelling as writer Amy Fox and first-time feature director Chris Terrio intended.
1,Rotten,"It's...familiar plotting and by-the-numbers characterization that sinks this earnest, gay-contoured take on the evergreen making-it-big melodrama."
1,Rotten,"Also last but not least, our sympathies for Patrick Stewart, who lends his voice to the poop emoji. Yes, you heard that right."
1,Rotten,"Guy Ritchie's remake is mediocre, time filling fodder and that's about the best compliment I can give it."
1,Rotten,"Strangely self-serious, and without covering the prerequisites of top-shelf nastiness that contemporary horror requires, this giant crocodile movie turns out to be neither fish nor fowl."
0,Fresh,Dujardin won an Oscar a few years ago without saying a word. He tops that performance here.
1,Rotten,It's the same movie except Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen battle a sorority instead of a frat.
1,Rotten,This bleak look at the hardship imposed by a monstrous parent and his downfall won't be worth a detour for most audiences.
0,Fresh,The storytelling techniques work well enough to keep the film engaging - though having characters read out messages as they type them gets annoying pretty quickly - and Scott keeps the pacing breezy and relatively light.
0,Fresh,The Thief is a beautiful movie about terrible things that happen to a widow and her young son.
1,Rotten,"Boring, nonsensical horror flick."
0,Fresh,"It has it all: great battles and special effects, a touching human tale, dramatic twists, wit and humor, stunning scenery, super-cool gadgets, a clear place in the Marvel mythology."
1,Rotten,"Midway through, Rapp loses momentum, failing to hone in on just what kind of movie he wants to make, and Winter Passing languishes in that no-man's land between tiny, meandering, indie drama and plotted, pointed family melodrama."
0,Fresh,"May be the most intellectually demanding motion picture of the year. Some will find their mind satiated. Others will leave angry. In one way or another, all will be baffled."
0,Fresh,"Great Streep, iffy movie."
0,Fresh,The perfect family film for the festive season.
0,Fresh,"Nothing of what follows will be this surprising, or surprising at all, but that's not to belittle a tender film that goes beyond twinkly silver-haired romance ..."
0,Fresh,The result is a tightly plotted thriller that looks like The Shard but occasionally sounds like The Gherkin. It gets away with it.
1,Rotten,"Seems to beg for a 'used' label, not primarily because it's based on an old TV show, but because it stubbornly embraces the tired tropes of every dumb action movie Hollywood's ever made."
1,Rotten,This one's strictly for the kiddies.
0,Fresh,The film absorbs elements of documentary and improvisation to produce a remarkably organic whole.
0,Fresh,The movie avoids Alien space monster clichés brilliantly and the soundtrack contains more of the 'Boo!' effects than I've heard since Halloween.
0,Fresh,"Genuinely heartwarming, totally cheerworthy, bursting with warm and generous performances, and just a whole damn lotta fun. (And I hate professional wrestling.) Florence Pugh absolutely rocks it."
0,Fresh,Buster Scruggs is full-blooded bliss splashed across an American frontier as mad and savage as decades of storied nightmarish incivility. It's bleak. It's bloody. It's bounteous. Probably great!
0,Fresh,"Although the tone of the film drifts precariously toward the self-serious, writer/director Chris Kraus redeems himself with snatches of dark jailhouse humor and a quiet attentiveness to minute gradations of human feeling."
0,Fresh,A pleasingly gauzy bit of nostalgia that feels softer and less cynical than anything I've previously seen in a [Shane] Meadows film.
1,Rotten,"Suffers from both a curiously passive central character and the faith-based dramatic flattening that seems to be a hallmark of producers Mark Burnett and Roma Downey ... The plot still has enough juice to work, but only just."
0,Fresh,"It doesn't tread much new ground, but that's beside the point. The lack of a black princess in Disney's repertoire was as appalling as it was glaring. This otherwise excellent film makes a solid effort to remedy that."
0,Fresh,The film is merely heartwarming without inspiring the rousing spirit of activism it depicts.
0,Fresh,Not as bad as you'd expect. Good for a rainy day.
1,Rotten,I cannot help but think that maybe [Travolta's] laughing that he was able to sucker people into pouring millions of dollars toward making such an unspeakable waste.
1,Rotten,The film itself is not as impressive as Whitaker's performance.
0,Fresh,A low-budget film keenly attuned to the weird little behaviors human beings unsuccessfully hide from each other.
0,Fresh,"Apatow finally changed up his bathroom humor act and resorted to a violent stoner movie, which works quite well! McBride steals the film with his hilarious performance that even outshines Franco's out of whack character."
0,Fresh,"The birth of Parinya's gender struggle is Freudian to the nth degree, but the confusion is evoked as a magical-realist pageantry of clashing cultural and sexual signifiers."
1,Rotten,"At least Hoult is trying to do something different, but his effort can't prop up the feature, which slowly loses focus and timing, ending up an uninspired mess."
0,Fresh,"There's probably not an adjective in the thesaurus that hasn't been deservedly laid at Dench's feet, and Coogan is right there with her."
0,Fresh,I liked the feeling of adults having adult conversations about adult things.
0,Fresh,"Sincere try, but even with censorship issues, the 1946 version was better."
0,Fresh,"It's the best movie Oliver Stone has helmed since the 20th century. While it lacks the emotional wallop or technical prowess of his revered projects from the 1980s and '90s, it at least finds him shakily getting back on his feet."
1,Rotten,"Cutesy, cuddly pap."
1,Rotten,It's a mishmash of ideas that aren't bad. They just aren't that good either.
0,Fresh,"[Langella's] sometimes halting but always beautifully articulated line deliveries impeccably convey a man for whom words are, literally, everything, including a last line of defense."
0,Fresh,"Fassbinder uses dramatic and visual excess to push everyday events to extremes, achieving a degree of political and psychological truth not accessible through mere social realism."
1,Rotten,"Usher, who has a squinty charm, is forced to display an infinite polite chivalry that would have shamed Sidney Poitier."
0,Fresh,An enjoyable but less than totally absorbing linear adventure.
0,Fresh,Tangled is a delightful rendition of a well-known fantasy that can be enjoyed by Disney animation and fairytale fans of all ages.
0,Fresh,This is an uneven adventure that's saved by the spectacle of its towering title character and the various beasts with whom he shares his island home.
1,Rotten,"When the swerves hit, preposterousness obliterates cleverness."
0,Fresh,Ghost is a real genre-bender of a film...
0,Fresh,"The paper-thin plot is just a figleaf for the singing and dancing, and of that there's lots. These kids can do it, and that more than anything else makes the mediocre script worth the trouble."
1,Rotten,"The animation quality equals that of the 1990s CGI TV series ""ReBoot,"" which was great...for the 1990s."
1,Rotten,It is all too simplistic and obvious and increasingly the preachy tone becomes irritating.
1,Rotten,"The actors hit their marks and say their lines; the movie looks polished and professional. And it's completely empty, unable to interrogate its subject in any way that matters."
1,Rotten,It's not The Rock's fault.
0,Fresh,A nasty treat for those with strong stomachs.
0,Fresh,"There's a timeless charm to The Old Man and the Gun, easily obsessed in the breezy chemistry of its two elegant stars."
1,Rotten,You can't cheat death. (But apparently you can cheat audiences over and over.)
1,Rotten,"Far from the worst of the X-Men films but it might be the most disappointing. Such a sour note for an ambitious, occasionally significant franchise like this to go out on."
1,Rotten,While the original kept you awake all night as you left the lights on and spooned your +h Pound Puppy-the sequel induces a sound slumber in seconds.
1,Rotten,"A somewhat drab and unimaginative telling further dents this dull melodrama of already rather limited psychological insights, and pat conclusions and catharses."
1,Rotten,"Frankly, your children deserve better."
0,Fresh,"A film that plays like a passive checklist of Reddy's Wikipedia page, it's a nostalgic and wistful biography sadly lacking any real depth."
0,Fresh,"Isle of Dogs puts form ahead of narrative, which is fine, because it's always a pleasure to observe the intricate affairs of Anderson's minimalist movie realm..."
0,Fresh,His assembly of a beautiful montage of Parisian scenery that precedes the opening credits sets the unique tone Allen chases to perfection.
0,Fresh,Eastwood... blurs the line between law enforcement and the way the Mob conducts its business to provide extra food for thought in a compelling and well-paced tale.
0,Fresh,The mesmerising Garca and sensitive direction by Lelio light up this delicate yet spiky drama. Terrific stuff from both Chileans.
1,Rotten,Spider revisits too many worn-out tuffets.
0,Fresh,"If you like that kind of banal, rustic and sophomoric humor (and I have to admit, I kinda do), it might be worth a buck or two at a discount theater."
0,Fresh,"The Academy might as well hand over the animated feature Oscar to Brad Bird right now, since it is hard to imagine any other film coming close to his glorious new film Ratatouille in this or any year."
0,Fresh,"The usually lovable Anne Hathaway takes a dark turn as the spoiler at a long wedding weekend, and helps deliver a close-up, gut-wrenching tale of family ties."
0,Fresh,What works best about Cruise in American Made is that it's a role seemingly scripted for him.
1,Rotten,"There's a huge difference between conveying the numbing, dehumanizing and mindlessly repetitive nature of factory drudgery in a movie, and subjecting your audience to the same by involving them visually in that unbearable tedium."
0,Fresh,"The absurdly funny Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is at once a glorious send-up of NASCAR culture and a goofy celebration of the redneck, red state, red-blooded American culture that spawned it."
0,Fresh,Anomalisa is an impressive technical feat and another Kaufman film that grows like a virus in your subconscious.
1,Rotten,"Although passable, Nancy Drew would feel right at home on the Disney Channel or Nickelodeon, which means the real mystery is how it ended up with a widespread theatrical release."
1,Rotten,"Zhang is more interested in ceremonies than combat sequences. Ranks of soldiers in exotic uniforms march into position atop battlements, while both feast and funeral are played out as spectacles."
0,Fresh,"... the scene in the bar, which is heard from two different perspectives, is remarkable. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,Richard Jewell squanders its chance to tell the whole truth...
1,Rotten,An insufferable comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"[Cyrus is] believable as Ronnie partly because she, too, is 17 and at a crossroads in her life."
0,Fresh,"As far as cinematic adaptations of video games go, Rampage is one of the better ones."
0,Fresh,"Page gently matures the girlish Nell, creating a figure of increasing psychological strength, while the more high-strung Eva, who cannot cope without music to dance to, falls into a despair that Wood makes desperately real."
0,Fresh,Elling is a light but self-sufficient comedy.
0,Fresh,Spielberg has done and said a lot more about war in this film than any other film in history ever has.
0,Fresh,Pete Davidson gives a genuine and brilliant lead performance in another Judd Apatow hit. One of my favorite films of the year.
0,Fresh,"It serves up its cautionary tale with a schlocky blend of dark humor, breakneck action, and unsettling body horror."
1,Rotten,A thoroughly depressing teen farce in which Internet voyeurism has replaced human intimacy and where privacy is *so* 20th century.
0,Fresh,"Through the use of music, animation, handheld camera footage, and razor-sharp editing, Zagar creates a brilliant cinematic equivalent of Torres's tome, a task much harder than you might imagine."
1,Rotten,"Cena's stiff manner barely matters in 12 Rounds, in which he plays a cop rather than a fighter, because this is all about big explosions."
0,Fresh,"Even if you don't care all that much about fashion, McQueen is very much worth your time."
0,Fresh,All the elements of the story fit impeccably together for a humorous and occasionally wrenching examination of relationships.
0,Fresh,Sharkwater is fascinating both as political statement and beautifully filmed documentary.
0,Fresh,"One of the best films of the year, it speaks to the heart and models a working-class hero whose riches have nothing to do with money."
0,Fresh,"""The Story of Qui Ju"" reaffirms Zhang Yimou's stature as storyteller and sociologist extraordinaire, and as a visual artist of exceptional delicacy and insight."
1,Rotten,"""All I See Is You"" is halfway through before something resembling a plot kicks in, and even then this limp, shape-shifting psychodrama proves unable to sell it with anything approaching coherence."
1,Rotten,"Mostly, it's just a frustrating whole comprised of some pretty promising parts."
0,Fresh,"Some pacing issues aside, Birds of Prey is a neon-blood-soaked, funny, violent, anti-hero caper. It manages to be authentic without being heavy-handed, and happily obliterates the male gaze in a technicolour firework display."
0,Fresh,A daring and gleeful rearrangement of film grammar and a zinging ode to the imagination.
0,Fresh,"Populated with unlikely occurrences and oddball characters, it plays out, to put it most complimentary, like a dull, slower moving After Hours."
1,Rotten,"It's a paradox--it's at once exhilarating yet exhausting, thrilling yet boring, masterful yet banal."
0,Fresh,"Like Moonlight and Get Out, this is a non-traditional, multi-genre film with impressive cinematography, a smart screenplay with some creative twists - and brilliant performances from the lead players."
1,Rotten,"The In-Laws, like too many movies these days, takes a clever little idea and all but pounds it into the ground."
1,Rotten,"An overlong, joyless, and inconsequential affair, full of dead air, and possessing only a few moments of jaw-dropping bad taste."
1,Rotten,"The movie would have been better if it had been a documentary with authentic Eskimos, rather than having actors dressed up as indigenous peoples. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,It might entertain a rowdy teen boy but is likely to make pretty much everyone else roll their eyes.
1,Rotten,"Song to Song unfolds in and around the rock scene in Malick's adopted home town of Austin, but you sense it wouldn't be noticeably different if it had been set at a bacon factory or an ice rink."
0,Fresh,"The directors are smart enough to understand that no matter how strongly you believe in a position, that belief is probably more shaded than a one-word ""Yes"" or ""No."""
1,Rotten,"This teen comedy with a ""be yourself"" message is slickly artificial, grinding painfully through extremely well-worn plot mechanics and essentially failing to follow its own message."
1,Rotten,"Now and then, Blood Glacier seems so damn goofy that it's tempting to view it as a stealth comedy."
0,Fresh,"If it is a swansong for YA, it's a solid one."

0,Fresh,All three talented actors pull from within to demonstrate the innermost heart and soul of each and everyone of us.
0,Fresh,"It also allows Soderbergh and writer Paul Attanasio, in a smart, well-paced adaptation, to explore a moral complexity that never found its way into movies of that era."
0,Fresh,"A potentially disposable, tongue-in-cheek First Blood pisstake turns out to be a deeply effective, surprisingly touching tale of family and childhood friendship. If you only see one Rambo movie this year, make sure it's this one."
0,Fresh,EDEN LOG is visually stunning - it's a bleak trip into a world that both mesmerizing and terrifying.
1,Rotten,"There's a lot of valuable information here, but for all the archival footage on view, dance is rarely allowed to make its effect."
1,Rotten,A Million Ways to Die's endless parade of toots undermines its actors. The writing also manages to find less-scatological ways to disrespect women and minorities.
0,Fresh,"Powerful story of trans woman's grief; language, sex, nudity"
0,Fresh,"It could be argued Nyong'o is giving one of, if not the, best female horror lead performances ever, basically having to play both Michael Myers and Laurie Strode at the same time."
0,Fresh,"For mature audiences who have forgotten how to smile, it takes up where The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left off."
1,Rotten,Steven Soderbergh's guilty-pleasure for sexually frustrated housewives fails to accomplish its modest thematic aspirations.
0,Fresh,A tangled tale of crime and punishment that mines the Lone Star lore of guns and killing.
0,Fresh,"An original and brilliant combination of comedy, action and sophisticated political comment."
0,Fresh,"Cube gives a layered, subtle portrayal and it is a pleasure to watch Curtis bloom along with Jasmine."
1,Rotten,"The filmmakers just can't resist sentiment, and seem happy to wallow in corny humour, predictable sappiness and heavy-handed moralising."
1,Rotten,"Nothing that happens here is particularly touching, exciting or funny."
1,Rotten,"Even though it stretches to nearly two-and-a-half hours and concludes with an extended gun battle, by the time ""Divergent"" ends, it still seems to be in the process of clearing its throat."
1,Rotten,"Make sure to catch this latest iteration of the Jules Verne novel on a screen projecting it in 3-D format because without all the fun visual effects of stuff 'comin' right at ya,' this journey's center will not hold."
0,Fresh,"There are specs of brilliance, imagination, and penetrating moments from John Huston and Peter Bogdanovich that make the film all the more exhilarating. Needless to say, the film is a conundrum."
0,Fresh,"Regardless of its box office performance, Prometheus has a long life ahead of it."
0,Fresh,"Important for what it teaches about revenge, justice and forgiveness. But you'll have to ignore the goofiness."
1,Rotten,"Snyder's films lavish attention on men who are principled brutes and on women who are sexy, strong and secondary. He's driven by big ideas, but he never seems to consider the problems of macho justice."
0,Fresh,The thrilling stunts and hyperkinetic action scenes are the undisputed stars of this surprisingly entertaining film.
1,Rotten,Shows all the symptoms of a franchise that has passed its sell-by date.
1,Rotten,Stick It is a melodrama that doesn't know when to turn off the waterworks.
0,Fresh,"Cranston plays Trumbo as a magnificent thorn in the side of political right. His magnanimous personality, keen powers of persuasion and gift of the gab kept him safe for a while."
0,Fresh,"If ""The Trip to Italy"" begins shakily, it ends with expansive bliss ..."
1,Rotten,"Screenwriter Mark Jacobson has done little to make this love triangle clearer than mud. The script is one trite cliche after another, and Pesci is little more than a caricature of himself in past roles."
0,Fresh,An admirable cat-and-mouse tale that puts forth a lot of clichs and executes them with B-movie intensity.
1,Rotten,"This one had the most potential, and in that way it is the most disappointing."
0,Fresh,A lovely film. A bucolic romance with a western soul. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Both elegy and unintentional suicide note, the film is one of the most devastating archival collages playing this year's Tribeca festival."
1,Rotten,Burn After Reading is a movie about stupidity that left me feeling stupid.

1,Rotten,"If ever a film demanded to be viewed on a phone, it's this one."
1,Rotten,"Quickly gets bogged down in a flaccid romance that seems about as genuine as Bob Dole in a Viagra commercial, and has even worse dialogue."
0,Fresh,"It's fascinating and entertaining, but rather dull as well."
1,Rotten,"Flatliners is moderately entertaining hocum at times, when it doesn't reach too far. Roberts is the best of the adequate bunch -- only her fans should make this a must-see."

0,Fresh,McKay wrote and directed a terrific script and assembled a superb cast.
0,Fresh,"With revelations at every turn, director Rowan Athale and writer Eric Garcia prove themselves dedicated to unpredictability, with each scene designed to have you guessing how it will plug into the increasingly bizarre story."
1,Rotten,This feast is more like an artfully arranged appetizer plate.
1,Rotten,'Shrooms' director Paddy Breathnach still hasn't the foggiest idea of how to make a horror.
0,Fresh,"Stop the presses! Wait, am I stopping them because Val Kilmer has made his first good film since Tombstone, or because writer Shane ""I Am Everything Wrong with Hollywood"" Black totally knocked his directorial debut off the wall for extra bases?"
1,Rotten,"..a handsomely mounted production with a flippant rockabilly soundtrack and hollow emotional core. Incendiary as it tries to be, ""The Killer Inside Me"" left me pretty cold."
1,Rotten,"To mangle the old cliche, politics' loss is not cinema's gain."
0,Fresh,"Give Deja Vu enormous credit for solving the main problem that has afflicted time-travel movies for decades; the most recent entry in the rewriting-reality genre is tense, well-acted and smart."
1,Rotten,"In the hallowed frames of 42, the legend is front and centre and still inspiring. Too bad the more interesting man is nowhere to be seen."
0,Fresh,"For the kids, the action is always lively and, for the rest of us, the dialogue has a witty and even caustic edge."
0,Fresh,This is mega-budget entertainment at its most fun and fantastic.
0,Fresh,"Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and David Carradine are simply more fun to watch than Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox."
1,Rotten,"Like that opening sex scene, presented just muddily enough to seem both slightly lurid and tastefully grave, Elles comes off as equally simplistic and indistinct."
0,Fresh,"Anyone who knows about ballet will find much to recognize in the lives of these young women, but for those who do not, the film will be a revelation."
0,Fresh,"Hugely derivative, but highly entertaining."
0,Fresh,"Harrowing, controlled and diabolically self-assured, Joshua leaves filmgoers teetering on their own emotional precipice, wondering just where pathos ends and pathology begins."
0,Fresh,"The film's great calling card is it's uniqueness - some might call it freaky or a novelty, but in any case, it's not a film we've seen before"
0,Fresh,"Proudly retro and coyly innocent, it's the perfect movie for a tweeny sleepover."
1,Rotten,A futuristic gore fest that spills oceans of sticky stage blood but misses in a rather anemic attempt to pierce the heart.
1,Rotten,Har'el still seems tied too tightly to her work as a music video director
0,Fresh,No one blows up your life quite like family.
1,Rotten,"The filmmakers ... have a wrongheaded expectation that we'll be endlessly fascinated by this abusive jerk's china-trashing Gordon Ramsay tirades and eventual, too-easy mea culpa. Sorry, not to our taste."
0,Fresh,It is almost ten years since Amma Asante made an award-winning directorial debut with A Way Of Life. The long wait for her second feature is amply rewarded with Belle.
1,Rotten,Endless running and hiding and running and fighting and running and running...
1,Rotten,"It's all too much, despite a bravura performance by McAvoy, who sinks his teeth into the rich and unusual opportunity to portray so many unhinged villains"
0,Fresh,Perhaps the funniest thing about Kill Bill: Volume One is the realization that this ode to ultraviolence and Uma Thurman's feet is probably Quentin Tarantino's most personal film.
0,Fresh,"Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom is a bad movie, but it is mostly a good bad movie in that it is fun and often stupid enough to be hilarious."
1,Rotten,"This tepid, watered down, sanitized chick flick of strip club ladies getting some kind of twisted revenge on the men they entertain misses the mark entirely."
0,Fresh,"The journey that Sen invites us to take is one of discovery, as he metaphorically digs in the dusty earth to find the clues that allow the mystery to be unravelled"
1,Rotten,...mostly a big bore that delivers on few of its promises...Cutler's inadvertent focus on Coddington suggests a conceptual change during filming stuffed into a pre-conceived marketing campaign.
0,Fresh,A Prophet is one of the must-see foreign language films of 2010.
1,Rotten,"Given how much of Pan is frustratingly wrongheaded, the whole thing should have been given the hook long before it ever hit theaters."
0,Fresh,It Happened One Night is one of the easiest movies to love and one of the hardest to think of as a work of art.
0,Fresh,"Who's been murdering newlyweds, turning a beachy paradise into a tropical hell shared by three pretty couples? You'll probably guess, but that doesn't take away from the slicked-up genre charms of this A Perfect Getaway."
0,Fresh,"It's a buddy-cop action comedy of the sort that you have seen approximately infinity times before. It is also, of course, a good Ice Cube movie."
1,Rotten,Has so many deliberately designed details that the movie feels like it was created in a film festival laboratory.
1,Rotten,This is possibly the most joy-sucking film of 2011.
0,Fresh,"Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have proven once again they can write smart, clever dialog. They assembled an incredibly talented cast, underscored by a great soundtrack to make this a unique movie experience."
0,Fresh,"I liked Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, I just wish I loved it."
0,Fresh,"It's less about battlefields and weaponry than it is about personality conflicts and the agonizing frustration that boils inside people who want to put positive changes into effect, but are too entangled in red tape to do much of anything."
0,Fresh,Chapman and Macneill have a truly chilling character whose evolution will be both fascinating and frightening to watch unfold.
0,Fresh,"Feel free to take a walk down memory lane with the Ghostbusting girls, confident that they haven't committed any major sacrilege against your fondest cinematic memories. Just know they haven't done anything to add to them either."
1,Rotten,A sumptuously designed visual feast that has no real personality or soul of its own
0,Fresh,"Anderson's mannerisms have been irritating in the past, but pitching a film at children has restored his sweet-natured charm. This is hip - but with heart."
0,Fresh,Michael Haneke's most intimate and painfully truthful film - an exploration of what love means at the far end of life.
0,Fresh,"This is not a sports movie. This is a movie about a man involved in sports. This is Jim Ellis' story. This is a story of heart, conviction, motivation, determination, pride."
0,Fresh,The Diary of Anne Frank is a film that paints an intimate picture of life during the Holocaust.
1,Rotten,"The story involves tricks and illusions, bluffs and double-bluffs, turnarounds and reverses, to the point where the unpredictable becomes weirdly predictable. Basically, you know that whatever seems to be happening probably isn't."
1,Rotten,"It's even less interesting than ""Centurion."""
0,Fresh,Hoffa shows DeVito as a genuine filmmaker. Here is a movie that finds the right look and tone for its material. Not many directors would have been confident enough to simply show us Jimmy Hoffa instead of telling us all about him.
1,Rotten,Hardwicke's latest is undeniably generic.
0,Fresh,"Internal Affairs is, for the dim movie season that is traditionally January, an unusually bright light."
0,Fresh,"It mostly succeeds in its own glittery, aggressively winsome way..."
0,Fresh,Filmed with such grandeur and intimacy that sometimes attempting to figure out how they made the incredible shots almost spoils them.
0,Fresh,Effective enough as a thriller and an indictment of sexism in its most brutal form.
0,Fresh,"Walking a fine line between darkly compassionate comedy, biting reality, striking low-budget fantasy and harsh psychological honesty, this modest but most disarming offering from funnyman Birbiglia is one of those pics that unexpectedly grows on you."
0,Fresh,"The Fight is a documentary about how the ACLU is working hard to make sure ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" doesn't become just ""the pursuit"" under President Trump."
0,Fresh,Plenty of startling moments from Bret Easton Ellis' novel will shock and wow you.
1,Rotten,The most lurid and frequently obnoxious sex drama seen in quite some time.
0,Fresh,"Like Blue Ruin before it, part of the beauty of Green Room is that it feints like it's going to be a festival indie before becoming a balls-to-the-wall action thriller that treats introspection like leprosy."
0,Fresh,This is one hellova movie and there's no doubt that Kingsley is due for another Oscar nomination.
0,Fresh,"This appears to be the movie that its makers intended, but it still feels like a little more depth could have provided much more impact."
0,Fresh,Stretches the boundaries of offensiveness in ways that both make us laugh and make us think.
0,Fresh,"Spare and contained, with a timeless quality that makes it seem less a product of an individual human imagination than a collective memory..."
0,Fresh,This is no less than a meditation on the infinite possible variations that a human life can take.
1,Rotten,"Should this universe get expanded on the creators' terms, I'm game for more - but would prefer it not be yet another variation on monsters in the dark with a token blonde."
1,Rotten,Don't get me wrong: There are a lot of laughs in The Boss. The problem is that the space in between them is stagnant and shapeless.
0,Fresh,"Jacob's Ladder only belongs to the horror genre insofar as it understands these conventions well enough to simultaneously borrow from and transcend them. In the process, it becomes something else altogether."
1,Rotten,"Too many narrative illogicalities make the 86 minutes seem long, despite two excellent performances and an intriguing premise."
0,Fresh,"While [Alita: Battle Angel] falters in its storytelling and treatment of characters, it's so damn badass and fun that it's worth suffering its flaws."
0,Fresh,Frank Oz has made a career of making comedy out of on-set tensions and his actors' personal anxieties.
0,Fresh,In 3:10 to Yuma director James Mangold has made himself a grand Western.
0,Fresh,"The film is so full of riches, so perfectly constructed to gain the maximum effect with the minimum of fuss, that it can be enjoyed on many levels."
0,Fresh,"Weird, yes. And wonderful."
1,Rotten,"Perry doesn't have any delusions of artistry, and potentially, at least, that's refreshing. But any points he earns for lack of pretense are immediately gobbled up by his lack of subtlety."
1,Rotten,"Great work by Dern, but I don't understand the director's need to denigrate Midwestern and/or lower-class people, and depict them as a tribe of slack-jawed morons."
1,Rotten,"Kinberg obviously knows these characters well, and he's spent more than thirteen years bringing them to life on the screen; so why don't we actively care more about them?"
0,Fresh,Its extraordinary power lies in the interweaving of the fantastical and the everyday.
1,Rotten,"Vaughn is stuck playing the straight man to a collection of stooges, and he looks utterly bored doing it."
1,Rotten,Five posh First World War sprogs are despatched to Uncle Kenneth Branagh's Gothic pile in a Devon nook. It's a ghastly film
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the film is often stately and sluggish with some very daytime-soapy moments of emotional revelation."
0,Fresh,"""Look at me!,"" Harry screams in anger early in the film. A command I highly recommend."
1,Rotten,"It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does. The film's inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned, it's downright irritating."
0,Fresh,"It's vicarious fun. And, with gas prices this summer, who's going to be able to afford this sort of road trip?"
0,Fresh,"A wholly empathetic film that tries to bolster its audience and characters, granting the audience permission to latch on and find humility and hope as Jared, Nancy and co., do."
0,Fresh,"The entire ensemble, but especially Ms. Redgrave, convey the flights of feeling that entangle their lives, the sudden changes of fervor that make life both exciting and anxiety-ridden."
0,Fresh,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes wisely weaves a tale of the flaws in human and simian natures. It also manages to say a thing or two about the hollowness of most summer blockbusters.
0,Fresh,"The women are drawn so fully, and so artfully, that I had to give the film a conditional pass."
0,Fresh,"Captain Marvel does the job it was meant to do, and I can understand how some people might like it more than others."
0,Fresh,"From a beginning that merely sketches the outlines of Cornelia's upper-class existence - she could be a contender for ""The Real Housewives of Bucharest"" - ""Child's Pose"" takes on more emotional substance as it develops."
0,Fresh,"The attention to detail in this film is exquisite, from the gold flakes on Belle's ballroom gown to the Fantasia-like theatrics of the Be Our Guest feast. All of the acting heavy hitters truly bring those inanimate objects to life."
0,Fresh,"Rob Reiner directs a high-achieving cast led by Woody Harrelson, who grabs his role as Lyndon Baines Johnson by the ears."
0,Fresh,Its scenes involving the perilous business negotiations offer more genuine intellectual excitement than any CGI-stuffed chase.
0,Fresh,"An enjoyably frenzied pulp thriller, not unlike the scripts for an entire season of TV's 24 being fed through a shredder over at The West Wing."
0,Fresh,"Up until the rote ending, an elegant and witty take on the werewolf story."
1,Rotten,"The skilful combination of old and new footage, almost seamlessly spliced together, still provides riveting material for viewers in a more cynical age."
1,Rotten,"Ironically, the filmmakers seem to think the audience for this movie about super-smart people is super-dumb."
1,Rotten,"As the film frequently informs you, these are bad people doing bad things to bad people. Many times. Over and over. Again. And again."
0,Fresh,"Dynamite ticking-bomb-thriller follow-up to the smash Da Vinci Code, about a cataclysmic device set to destroy the Vatican, will most certainly have explosive results at the box office."
1,Rotten,Everyone on view is so fundamentally decent and goody-goody that no real tension or unresolvable conflicts ever surface.
0,Fresh,The visually innovative documentary is a testament to the healing power of storytelling.
0,Fresh,"After the Wedding ends up feeling far weightier than it first appears, with its plot contrivances and unlikely coincidences generating such a messy range of emotions, they end up feeling a lot like real life."
1,Rotten,There was doubtless stupidity on both sides during the war; there's certainly no lack of it in The Devil's Brigade.
0,Fresh,"This hugely entertaining horror fable for all the family might suffer from pacing problems, but it's also a true original that still stands out from today's CGI-heavy crowd."
0,Fresh,"The Boxtrolls attempts both style and substance, and does a pretty good job achieving it."
1,Rotten,"We get some watchable flurries of hunt-'em-down suspense between the interminable kvetchings of the human prey, but the only salient reason to see this is the creature design, by those HR Giger-inspired wizards Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr."
1,Rotten,This ambitious and well-researched movie often trips over its own feet while translating its knowledge into a dramatic tale.
1,Rotten,"The story loses credibility as it goes along, as the body count escalates, and Robinson's solutions to life-and-death crises grow increasingly far-fetched. Well before it ends preposterously, ""Black Sea"" has taken leave of its senses."
0,Fresh,"The rest of the film doesn't work, but there's enough monster combat here to make it all worth it. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"On the heels of the threadbare Tuxedo, Shanghai Knights confirms there may be a chink in Jackie Chan's armor."

1,Rotten,How dare Luke Scott tease us with a captivating premise and then assault our eyes with such nonsense.
1,Rotten,"You're left wondering 'What if?,' as in 'What if the filmmaker had found a way to reconcile his two storylines into a cohesive whole?'"
1,Rotten,"As a movie, there's plenty here to respect. As entertainment, however, this is tough one to enjoy, all of which makes Criminal a vexing spectacle that's hard to watch all the way through to its end."
0,Fresh,Surprisingly entertaining and fun.
0,Fresh,[Eddie Redmayne and Alecia Vikander] give The Danish Girl its heart and soul.
0,Fresh,"The movie is also just plain out fun, and I feel like a lot of other horror films could take a lesson from it."
0,Fresh,"The unusual casting selections may require a brief period of adjustment on the part of the viewers, but in the long run, help cement the idea that the film is only a guesstimate of what happened, not the real deal."
0,Fresh,Quite possibly the greatest romantic comedy since Some Like It Hot.
0,Fresh,A masterpiece that HAS to be the front-runner for this year's animated Oscar. It's actually the rare 'toon that even deserves consideration for Best Picture.
0,Fresh,"Its Noah's-Ark-like coupling aside, the movie is at times awkwardly charming and generally innocuous: the stepsister isn't the baddie, and female friendship isn't an impediment to a happily ever after."
0,Fresh,"In some ways the film is like an amusement park ride. You see the curves and twists coming, but if you're going fast enough, they're scary anyway."
0,Fresh,"There are a handful of actors working today whose mere presence justifies whatever film they are in. Kurt Russell is at the top of a very short list for me, and has been so for decades."
0,Fresh,"John Wick has a more identifiable ancestry: the chic, sleek and widely imitated South Korean gangster film. The copy is not as effective as the original, but at 101 minutes, it's at least efficient."
0,Fresh,"Despite the false notes and grinding bleakness, the film's insider savvy makes for pungent drama."
1,Rotten,"The best satires draw blood, this one just pours it all over the screen."
0,Fresh,"Mind-boggling, electric, and hugely-entertaining, this is one of the best surprises this year."
1,Rotten,There is so much wrong with White Fang that it's easier to point out the good.
1,Rotten,"Full of heavingly gorgeous images that envelop a viewer before smothering them, its maddening elements eventually become too much to bear."
1,Rotten,"All the blood and nudity mark Turistas as an exploitation film, of the horror-thriller variety -- but who knew exploitation could be so boring?"
1,Rotten,Fans of the evangelical-Christian film genre ... should demand higher production values instead of blindly supporting a movie just because they appreciate its themes.

0,Fresh,"Good for little ones, watchable for their parents."
0,Fresh,A solid thriller!
1,Rotten,"Glass disappoints, but is not unwatchable. It's not in the same league of Unbreakable and Split. James McAvoy continues to be sensational as The Horde."
0,Fresh,"Clint Eastwood has always proven to be a good, reliable storyteller and, here, he tells a good, reliable story."
1,Rotten,It's a crazy quilt made of bits from all of Shadyac's work.
0,Fresh,Quentin Tarantino does it again. Again.
0,Fresh,A visually exuberant film with a seductively perverse story that takes us from the exciting curiosity of the beginning to a growing and sustained perplexity. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Comes across like a bad 'Saturday Night Live' political sketch, dragged on for way too long ... a lot of great talent wasted."
1,Rotten,...Zwick never really solves the problem of how to make a houseful of semi-likable characters into cinema.
0,Fresh,Woman in Gold is a David-and-Goliath story.
0,Fresh,"John Hillcoat makes manly movies. 'Triple 9' is a masculine motion-picture for men, at the multi-plex-more so in the man-cave. Don't spend the moolah; wait for it on Netflix."
0,Fresh,"Not only is this movie loaded with amazing acting, especially from Lakeith Stanfield, but it's filled with scenes that are equal parts out-of-this-world and incredibly relevant."
0,Fresh,"To lazily but wholly appropriately use a very hoary old clich, Pan is fun for the whole family."
0,Fresh,A lively and agreeable work of fanboy art - a first-rate film fashioned from secondhand materials.
0,Fresh,"A thrilling, often weepy tale of female empowerment."
0,Fresh,The genius of Titanic does not lie in the story itself. It lies in how the story is told.
1,Rotten,Perhaps more problematic than the film's derivative nature -- with plot points and dialogue borrowing somewhat from Sex and the City and rather heavily from Woody Allen -- is the fact that the film is just not funny.
1,Rotten,"While providing a total immersion in music and politics, its ultimate effect is a whirlwind of images and assertions that leave few lasting impressions."
1,Rotten,Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong. They cheapen the overall effect.
1,Rotten,"Might have worked a little better on stage, and with a few different actors."
0,Fresh,Ferrell totally gets the anchorman of the 70s vibe and pulls off even the lamest lines without breaking a sweat
1,Rotten,A funny thing happened on the way to this DVD review...
1,Rotten,Right now my greatest fear in life are the words Tomb Raider 2.
0,Fresh,"The truth of the matter is that the film Toni Erdmann is a family drama but one laced with enough humour that there is room to interpret proceedings as a situational comedy, however, that would undermine the heartbreaking pathos within."
1,Rotten,"Identity Thief is supposed be a fun time, but robs you of it the whole 111 minutes you're sitting there watching it."
0,Fresh,"For the most part, a faithful recreation of the Blind Swordsman's mystique. Old fans should not be dissapointed, and new fans should seek out the source material post haste."
0,Fresh,"In short, Lynch as Republican."
1,Rotten,This is what your children will want to see this weekend. Don't let them.
0,Fresh,"Every visual element contributes to defining the characters and moving the story forward, while still looking effortlessly cool."
0,Fresh,"[The film] is able to move emotionally, from the rage of an idle summer to the icy winter...From the rhythm of an eighties song, to the soft, sharp and hurtful melody of Sufjan Stevens. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"I figure Brody chose his own hip-jutting, fashion-runway postures, little realizing at the time that he was about to punch a big-time ticket out of this indie palookaville."
0,Fresh,"The Safdies deserve respect for surviving their childhood, if not for making a film about it that refuses to amuse or indict."
0,Fresh,"If Eastwood intended to expose how the government could so abuse a simple, everyman, ""Richard Jewell"" marginally achieves that goal."
1,Rotten,"The only defense for Domino, the first-ever movie in a blender, is that director Tony Scott is pioneering a new form of cinema, in which the audience can never focus on a single object for more than a half second."
0,Fresh,[Joel Edgerton's] crafted a masterful thriller and sleeper hit in The Gift.
0,Fresh,"This time, everybody really does love Raymond."
1,Rotten,"It sometimes plays like a bizarre parody. It can be pretty entertaining once you've retuned your expectations, although it lurches into appallingly offensive territory in the form of some of Banning's take-down quips."
0,Fresh,An unusually thoughtful documentary about one of the modern era's most audacious art thefts.
1,Rotten,"Alas, much of the dialogue is the silliest sort of fantasy mush, and a good deal of the picture appears to have been shot while the lighting guys were out to lunch."
1,Rotten,"If you programmed an algorithm to figure out how The Lawnmower Man might be retold by Snake Plissken at the conclusion of Escape from L.A., you'd still wind up with a more recognizably human effort."
1,Rotten,"If I'd wanted to spend so much time watching people sleeping, I could have been a train conductor, flight attendant or nurse in a different life."
0,Fresh,It's assured filmmaking and proof that school isn't always the best days of your life.
1,Rotten,Watching Hawke investigate strange goings-on night after night without turning on one light in the house becomes unintentionally comical.
1,Rotten,"The various elements of 25th Hour are invariably provocative, but the husk of the story isn't up to the challenge."
1,Rotten,Well over $20 million was spent to create a film full of sound and fury but without an inkling of intelligence.
1,Rotten,"Fiennes and the screenwriter, Abi Morgan, have mounted an accurate re-creation of Victorian England, but the affair isn't much of a story-at least, not as realized here."
1,Rotten,This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material.
1,Rotten,Baywatch doesn't know whether it wants to be satirical or sincere.
1,Rotten,"Watch the documentary. This, it just 'movied' the whole thing."
0,Fresh,"When a character is in danger, you do feel that danger...there's something about the craftsmanship in this one. That feeling of security is gone, but the movie has a lot of humor too."
0,Fresh,"Half-baked but occasionally hilarious, National Lampoon's Vacation gets a reasonable amount of mileage out of depicting the disaster-prone journey of a ""typical"" family of four, the Griswolds of suburban Chicago."
1,Rotten,"(Director Oliver) Stone and his co-writers seem to be reaching for something important to say, but they fail, and we 'll never know what it is."
1,Rotten,"Even with the last world war as its backdrop, this story is one cold affair."
0,Fresh,"Overall, the film is good, especially due to Mulligan who should likely receive some award nomination love come that time of year. (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - for Parents also available)"
0,Fresh,"Extract isn't an instant classic, but it bumps along agreeably, its humor culled from serial bad decisions, mock-romantic discontent and lots of spirited overacting ripe with good intentions."
1,Rotten,"Not that I'm opposed to some good ol' shoot-em-up violence, it's just hard to get your bearings as 'The Family' shifts frantically back and forth between giggles and gasps."
0,Fresh,"Shutter Island is, infantile as it sounds, akin to the sensation of settling onto a toilet seat that is shockingly, unexpectedly and uncomfortably frigid."
0,Fresh,"The Exorcist is what it purports to be, no less than one of the best horror films, one of the best films, of all time."
1,Rotten,"By right Bratz should have had no potential at all. Yet it is still disappointing to see the handful of clever ideas and heartfelt themes smothered by corporate, focus-group filmmaking."
0,Fresh,"Will not be to every taste, but for a few of us it's a treasure trove worth re-visiting, whether in small dips, or in another deep-dive."
1,Rotten,"Although it promises much, the film ultimately fails to deliver the substance, with the stream of deadly bullets making a goddamn mess but never quite hitting the artery"
0,Fresh,One of the many remarkable things about The King's Speech is how this subtle film's central relationship speaks to the divisions between people.
0,Fresh,"In many ways, it's steadfastly adult, a picture that admits, with every frame, a desire to hang on to everything we value about traditional modes of movie storytelling, instead of just trying to figure out what will win big at the box office."
1,Rotten,An erratic episodic comedy about just how funny a fetish can be.
0,Fresh,Hammer's fifth of seven Frankenstein films might be the best one in the series.
0,Fresh,"NASCAR enthusiast or not, it's a universally touching and charming film with the power to capture the heart of any viewer."
1,Rotten,"At best, it's unnecessary. At worst, it's vaguely insulting."
1,Rotten,Not a thriller so much as an extremely violent swimsuit calendar.
1,Rotten,Another assembly-line vehicle!
0,Fresh,"I know how nearly every shot was done by this point, but that hasn't dimmed what is to me the essential magic of the movie."
0,Fresh,Crude by the director's later standards but still an interesting melodrama into which he poured many of his early ideas.
1,Rotten,"Directed, with visible earnestness, by Patricia Riggen, Under the Same Moon blunts the hard edges of immigration with a thick coating of preciousness."
1,Rotten,"If you've grown tired of the vampire genre, it's hard to see this tale providing much in the way of reinvigoration."
1,Rotten,"As much as [De Palma] beautifies this mess-the movie's so sleek, you'll worry that the cast is gonna slip off the damn screen-it's still a mess."
0,Fresh,"Beneficiado por entrevistados com vasta experincia em uma indstria pouco conhecida do pblico em geral, o documentrio traa um retrato alarmante e informativo sobre a atividade de mercenrios no Iraque e em outras regies do planeta."
0,Fresh,Its simplicity and unique approach to the subject matter undeniably makes it a sci-fi spectacle in a class of its own.
0,Fresh,Its skillful balancing act of paganism and Christianity in its evocation of medieval Celtic spirituality is both fascinating and enchanting.
1,Rotten,"With its stereotypical characters and creaky plot turns, this passage to India feels even longer than its running time."
0,Fresh,Pain and Glory quite rightly asks its audience to appreciate Almodóvar while he's still mining his soul for melodrama every few years.
1,Rotten,The fatal irony at the heart of The Giver is too hilariously blatant to ignore: here is a dystopian teen drama about the perils of sameness that feels exactly like all of the other movies in its increasingly crowded genre.
1,Rotten,A very interesting romance with Yvonne DeCarlo exposing her sheer beauty.
1,Rotten,Have we ever before seen such big-ticket escapist entertainment about the awesomeness of something that so recently killed so many of us? Doesn't it usually take longer before everyone's eager for candy spun from trauma?
0,Fresh,"Unlike the popular space race films that have come before it, not a millisecond of First Man feels like typical hero worship."

0,Fresh,"What [director Claire] Denis seeks is to capture the interstices of love, the conversations in which intimacy is filtered, not by exposing them, but by hiding them. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,The only farcical aspect of it is that it was greenlit in the first place.
0,Fresh,"""Screened Out"" is guaranteed to hook you once you start watching."
0,Fresh,This incredible cinematic masterpiece takes you on a high-octane acid trip that gloriously assaults your senses... probably one the best action movies you'll ever see.
1,Rotten,"Cheesy '70s horror with domestic abuse, stereotypes."
0,Fresh,"Campbell gives the best Elvis impersonation to ever be seen on film. The movie is campy, but Campbell's performance is not, and that's a very important distinction."
0,Fresh,"The peculiar story 'structure' and pacing may test the patience of those expecting a more traditional cinematic story, but those who can understand what director Gus Van Sant is trying to do here won't be disappointed."
0,Fresh,It lobs a grenade at slasher-movie sadism by making us care about the characters as more than just body-bag fodder.
0,Fresh,"Happily, The Big Sick makes a welcome recovery from all these potential setbacks to be that rare thing, a genuinely feelgood comedy centred around an absolute bummer of an event."
1,Rotten,A rancid propaganda film with video game aesthetics.
1,Rotten,[T]hese adaptations of Nicholas Sparks' books ... have so many repeated motifs and scenarios that it's already becoming difficult to differentiate them.
0,Fresh,Stevie is gripping in its intimacy.
0,Fresh,"While this is by no means among Burton's best work, looking overedited and messy with too many characters for its flimsy script, it nevertheless has the potential for an entertaining night out."
1,Rotten,It just becomes dreary and repetitive.
0,Fresh,This irresistible Japanese film celebrates the spiritual uplift of boundless desire.
0,Fresh,"Aster's blend of beauty, violence, horror and humor leads to a climax that is both disturbing yet exhilarating."
1,Rotten,"An ugly, unwanted epilogue [to Connery's Bond], in which the character who was so iconic and perfect is reduced to a self-conscious joke."
0,Fresh,"There are inevitably reminders of Ealing comedies around and we are never quite certain whether it is all tongue-in-cheek, as the actors suggest, or a bit more spiky than that, as Wheatley's work implies."
0,Fresh,Gladiator is a triumphant reinvention of the sword-and-sandal epic that fell out of favor decades ago.
0,Fresh,"Activism proves tough on people who've thrived at their political patrons' blessings, and one character cruelly chooses a path of least resistance when the chips are down. A cataclysmic conclusion depicts political clamps on expression and emotion."
1,Rotten,"Everything about A Good Day to Die Hard, from the gratuitously destructive car chases to the obligatory series in-jokes to Bruce Willis's weary, half-hearted central turn, feels like an obligation."
0,Fresh,[Allen's] most entertaining picture since Bullets Over Broadway or maybe Sweet and Lowdown.
1,Rotten,"""Split"" doesn't do enough to overcome its weaknesses, bouncing between a grungy horror exploitation flick, a psychological thriller and a supervillain origin story."
0,Fresh,Demented!
0,Fresh,"In its final moments, as throughout, High Life is simultaneously hopeful and foreboding, distant and deeply moving."
1,Rotten,"Familiarity quickly breeds contempt, with Bullock rather obviously just along for the ride."
0,Fresh,The first half is terrifying -- or was when I was younger. The second half has a bad special effect spider.
0,Fresh,"A guy on a motorcycle careening through a cinema, wielding a katana blade and lopping off heads to the sound of 'Killers on the Attack.' It doesn't get any better than this."
0,Fresh,"I enjoyed Into Darkness immensely, and I can't wait to see it again... but I'm not sure I could call this a summery popcorny sort of film. It's too grim for that."
1,Rotten,"A film that, while returning to the founding, chase-picture premise of the franchise, appears to have been algorithmically conceived and directed by an AI filmmaking-chip that somehow made it out of the Skynet lab back in 1991."
0,Fresh,"Unfriended: Dark Web is a captivating, intricate - and we might as well go ahead and say it: ingenious - summer thriller that presupposes the nagging fears of those of us who can't do without our cell phones and other little electronic pacifiers."
0,Fresh,The best 'monster under water' pic since the original Jaws!
0,Fresh,"The minutes, hours and days blend together and the movie achieves something profound in the malaise."
0,Fresh,"Audiard's storytelling has an easy swing to it, his dialogue is garrulous and unsentimental, and the narrative is exotically offbeat."
1,Rotten,"If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright, then Blood Work is for you."
0,Fresh,"No matter the medium, RZA is a world-builder who has conceptualized the contours of the rich, bloody, dense universe he created down to the most insignificant details."
0,Fresh,"The ever-appealing Fanny Ardant and the enigmatic, pug-faced character actor Dominique Pinon have many subtle delights up their sleeves, and newcomer Audrey Dana is a revelation."
1,Rotten,"""Arrival"" is the sort of superficially profound movie that initially seems deep and weighty but stops making sense the moment you put down the bong."
0,Fresh,"Even if you're not a fan of Sparks movies, Forever My Girl offers several appealing elements."
0,Fresh,Ideas were flying around like bullets. And so were the footballs.
0,Fresh,"Brimming with exploitation antics, grindhouse sensibilities and, heh heh, exploding bunnies, Doomsday conjures a future thrown back to the dead-end styles and amoral excesses of the eighties - and no future could be bleaker than that."
0,Fresh,...joke-heavy and bullet-riddled and studded with some of the most crackling dialogue heard since 'The Front Page.'
0,Fresh,What Carol captures more specifically than the thrill of a romantic encounter is the act of remembering only to forget.
0,Fresh,"Here is a movie that takes its comic book roots and embraces them with such glee, the result is perhaps the quintessential Spider-Man film."
0,Fresh,"There are a couple of minor detours, but on the whole the movie never loses its way."
0,Fresh,"Weird as these boys are, and as their story is, Moselle's film is nothing but affectionate, and I found myself falling for their rather sweet unworldliness just as she obviously did."
1,Rotten,A crowd pleasing film from an already crowd pleasing director that feels without subtance. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Tris is no Katniss Everdeen, and Divergent is a better film for not trying to impersonate a similar trilogy. It won't excite the world to the extent of The Hunger Games but this more humble offering is nevertheless exciting, fun and satisfying."
1,Rotten,"Low-budget features command an automatic sympathy, but Wang quickly uses up his credit by wasting precious footage on unfocused atmosphere and failed improvisation, relegating plot and theme to an insistent voice-over narration."
1,Rotten,"Bullock is good, the script is not."
0,Fresh,"All Is Lost is very much Redford's triumph. His turn isn't pure disappearance so much as a brilliantly human example of cresting and plummeting, cresting and plummeting."
1,Rotten,The film feels fatuous and irritatingly complacent. Everybody's calling attention to the barrage of familiar clichés without doing much to subvert them.
1,Rotten,The new version just makes you feel like you've been watching a lame late-night rerun while stuck in a thunderdome.
1,Rotten,"Visually stunning and with flashes of inspired genius, Elysium shows promise but is let down by an uneven structure, weak characterisation and an over-reliance on extended fight scenes."
1,Rotten,Goldie fumbles.
0,Fresh,"In a Valley of Violence may ultimately present an unflattering view of humanity, but West bracingly restores the compassion that even Tarantino himself seems to have let slip through his grasp in his own recent Westerns."
1,Rotten,Transformers: Age Of Extinction will remind you of every reason why you love and hate Michael Bay.
0,Fresh,"The film is a veritable grab-bag of traits that may appeal to different viewers. As a whole, the film is likely to provide faults as well as triumphs."
0,Fresh,"Director Frankenheimer provides a steady hand, faltering only in one or two forced scenes intended to convey Johnson's growing alienation both politically and personally."
0,Fresh,"...it's a pretty neat trick to blend comedy with a story that's moving and relevant; it helps to have a smart screenplay, a strong cast, and an overall good vibe. Those qualities make 50/50 one of the bright spots on the fall movie map..."
1,Rotten,"Admirable in its different-ness, but it's sadly unmemorable and unsurprising. And Dr Doom looks weird. Really, really weird. And not in a good way."
1,Rotten,"The viewer is informed of a world of chaos, obsession, and irresolution, but has no cinematic means of accessing or understanding it."
0,Fresh,Powerful drama that takes cultural differences between family members seriously.
1,Rotten,Instead of anything clever or original as one might expect from Harold Ramis; we're subjected to gross-out jokes. Note to Mr. Ramis; the Fountain of Comedy Youth is probably not located in a sewer.
1,Rotten,Stay in and play Monopoly instead.
1,Rotten,"While Baruchel is fun to root for and watch flail about like a pipe-cleaner in the wind, this movie encourages a sick desire in me - to see Michael Cera and all the runners-up in the Mr. Puniverse Contest knocked down a peg..."
0,Fresh,"Like Tom Hardy in BRONSON, Matthias Schoenaerts gives a riveting, magnetic star making performance in this twist-turning gangster tale with a highly unusual backstory."
0,Fresh,"Dealing with a real-life event, Christopher Nolan has shifted out of cerebral overdrive and rediscovered a welcome directness and simplicity."
1,Rotten,Egoyan has made his Showgirls.

0,Fresh,Supple and technologically sophisticated entertainment.
0,Fresh,"Yes, Cradle 2 the Grave is predictable. Yes, it's admittedly dumb. But if you don't walk away from this one with a smile, you probably don't like action movies."
1,Rotten,Audience members probably fluttered their eyes in disbelief at this convoluted tale.
0,Fresh,"Keanu knows exactly what kind of movie this is, and doesn't pretend for a second that it's more important than it really is. It's a solid kick-ass martial arts movie, nothing more. I miss movies like this."
0,Fresh,"Absorbing, often electric with the energy of the playing field, Invictus is packed with feel-good ""teachable moments"" without the sugary aftertaste."
0,Fresh,"Unbeatable entertainment from India, and proof that the often derided Bollywood film industry is entirely capable of beating Hollywood at its own game."
0,Fresh,[T]his is a comedy about the here and now. Let's hope it's not about the future.
1,Rotten,What we are seeing is the most rational irrationality-and all sheer artifice anyway.
1,Rotten,An empty triumph of overkill set design and weirdo casting.
0,Fresh,"Brosnan, in his debut, turns in a great performance as 007."
0,Fresh,"Saturday afternoon matinee fun. Think Conan the Barbarian clashing with the gods of Clash of the Titans who are conquering Mars, Gladiator style."
1,Rotten,"Are the French especially prone to this kind of unintended silliness? ""Sky"" almost seems determined to prove they are."
0,Fresh,"I ceased smiling like a big dummy only during the two points in the film which had been engineered to make me cry, at which point, voil, tears."
0,Fresh,District B13 speaks the international language of brilliantly choreographed mayhem ... and could be the action movie to beat this year; we'll see if any other director comes close to equaling its delirious rush. The picture is 85 minutes long and
0,Fresh,Few directors tap their damaged past as brilliantly as Meadows. This is England is by far his most personal and powerful testimony.
0,Fresh,"Satire implies the provocation of laughter, even if it's harsh or mocking. The truly disturbing Get Out seldom raises so much as a smile."
0,Fresh,"[O]ne of the best things about Russell's pictures is the fact I don't want them to end, because I could spend hours more with the characters. That holds true again for Joy..."
1,Rotten,"Nuns acting like drunken sailors: funny in Boccacio's time, maybe, but forced humor today."
0,Fresh,"Intense drama about Orthodox Jews has mature themes, sex."
1,Rotten,Final destination? Video store bins.

0,Fresh,"Enough originality, clever set-ups and witty humor to keep anyone entertained."
1,Rotten,"If you're a kid, you'll probably like it."
1,Rotten,It never reconciles the meticulous intelligence needed to build the weaponry and the monstrous stupidity needed to use it.

0,Fresh,Superior Hammer horror classic.
0,Fresh,Beautiful to look at and easy to digest.

0,Fresh,Behind the film's brass knuckles are tender fingers.
1,Rotten,"A film that fancies itself smarter than it is, but ultimately comes up short in all areas."
1,Rotten,"With its belabored gags, misfired pop-culture references and garish visuals crammed together like so many disjointed body parts, this manic kidpic cranks up the annoy-o-meter early on and rarely lets up."
1,Rotten,[T]he movie portrays its issues so stereotypically that they simply exist to mechanically stoke Western audiences' fears.
1,Rotten,At least it isn't offensive.
1,Rotten,Little in this film suggests 'director' Jeff Byrd and writer Wayne Conley possess any facility -- or familiarity -- with irony or any other comedic device.
0,Fresh,"Bergman's superbly shot wintry images, much like those of a silent film, print themselves indelibly on the mind, while the Knight's search for a God who never answers foreshadows the pessimism of the director's later work."
0,Fresh,Polished Oscar bait with an award-worthy performance by Gary Oldman.
1,Rotten,Every moment of this Stephen King adaptation is phony.
0,Fresh,"Maybe it's not the 100-percent truth -- maybe it's half, or more, invented. But it's a damn good guess, and a ridiculously entertaining one."
1,Rotten,"Schamus and his fellow screenwriters have taken the most pompous elements of superhero comics -- the humorless archetypes, the italicized declamations -- and inflated them until they nearly burst with the strain."
0,Fresh,"Retains its central theme of the importance of family in a brand new colourful, happy adventure in 3D. Sid the goofy, buck-toothed Sloth (John Leguizamo) remains my favourite character"
0,Fresh,"This is basically a high-toned soap opera, but it is not overly serious. It is largely a comedy of manners. There is plenty of humor and high spirits in this story and the acting is excellent. The production values are first-rate."
1,Rotten,"The animation is still strong - there are some interesting and refreshingly uncuddly depictions of the spirit world from whence Kai springs - but, mainly, KFP3 is too much of a good thing."
0,Fresh,"A thriller, character study, and, to a lesser extent, coming of age romance. Yet it seamlessly balances all these elements to craft a story that grips as powerfully with its visuals as it does emotionally."
0,Fresh,"The romantic comedy has become such a wasteland of physical humor, predictable plots, and nauseating manipulation that Definitely, Maybe is more remarkable for what it doesn't do."
0,Fresh,"That A-list cast of ""retired, extremely dangerous"" spies is back, coasting through another amiable but uninspired action-comedy."
1,Rotten,"Never working up anywhere near the tension or the interest it thinks it has, The Statement is pedestrian almost from beginning to end."
1,Rotten,SOUTH OF THE BORDER points to the need of a good contemporary study of South American political movement rather than actually filling that vacancy.
0,Fresh,There's plenty to admire about both Taron Egerton and Hollywood's latest musical biopic. So why aren't we cheering like we should?
0,Fresh,"...it'll be with us years later as shattered pieces from its fall, making sense for the future of how we talk about racism, and the human monster that hides within it."
1,Rotten,"Despite its bawdy convictions, Kiss Of The Damned is an empty blood bank looking for willing donors to buy into its sultry showmance of perverse wonderment"
0,Fresh,"Toplined by Johnny Depp, who's in great form, Rango is a thematically witty, visually striking animated Western, a movie that could be enjoyed by younger and mature viewers in different ways."
1,Rotten,"As I was an infantry soldier in Afghanistan, the situational comedy related to Fey being in danger, or experiencing some mild hardship was just too slight. I kept wanting to say to the film, ""Hell, that's nothing..."""
0,Fresh,"The script excerpts the writer's poetry and prose sparingly and to good effect, Dillon's gravelly delivery full of an instinctive, deep feel for language."
0,Fresh,"In the end, it's just good, comprehensive storytelling, a film that justifies the legend rather than hypes it."
1,Rotten,"It's by-the-numbers, big-screen video gaming. Hooh-ra!"
1,Rotten,"The only thing to ""catch"" in this film is perhaps a cold--from sitting in the theater with the 'tweener set."
1,Rotten,"'Bullitt' is still remembered after 40 years for its car chase that only lasted 10 minutes. 'Getaway' is a 90 minute car chase and it will be forgotten by the end of the year, if not sooner."
0,Fresh,"This film is like a good read, as disarming in its predictability as it is in its assorted surprises and colorful ambience."
0,Fresh,The pacing is the key element here by which the film engages our sympathies for these characters without sinking into melodrama
1,Rotten,"A perfectly acceptable, perfectly bland, competently acted but by no means scary horror movie."
0,Fresh,"Brawl In Cell Block 99 takes a bit to get started, but when it does, it's a punishing spiral into the depths of exploitation madness too gory to believe."
0,Fresh,W. humanizes Bush in ways that will baffle critics of both the president and the filmmaker.
0,Fresh,"Helped along by an amazing cast of mostly first-time actors, ""Omar"" feels very fresh, due to its attitude, its approach, and the fact that it offers no solutions."
0,Fresh,"The dry film, more boring than it had a right to be, nevertheless was sincere and won an Oscar for Best Picture."
0,Fresh,The Paul Williams songs and Miles Goodman score are just lovely.
1,Rotten,"The Disappointments Room could have been an interesting film, but instead it was a befuddled mess with a title that makes for a great pun. The disjointed story is enough to make you want to walk out of the theater."
0,Fresh,Shadow of the Vampire is at once quite magnificent and extremely silly.
0,Fresh,The 9/11-style attack on London at the film's beginning is followed by backstory upon cover story and bright rhetoric soars and false flags are planted. They darkly wave. Political opportunity is not wasted on ready opportunists.
1,Rotten,Goes out of its way to prove that tastelessness does not equal comic inspiration.
0,Fresh,"it is a vacuous trawl through horror's more sensationalist tropes... but that is just another way of saying that this is popcorn cinema at its most unapologetic and unpretentious, guaranteed to delight gorehounds and to bring young lovers closer together."
0,Fresh,"The film does maintain a powerful mood throughout, a kind of stringency, and the fate of the humans fades into insignificance as the film draws to a bleak close."
1,Rotten,Quest skirts dangerously close to being the thing it parodies: a second-rate space opera.
1,Rotten,Not a thing about this story withstands two second's worth of scrutiny.
0,Fresh,It's engaging as it weaves personal interviews with a treasure trove of archival footage and images. You really get to understand the history and the struggles these women face every day.
0,Fresh,"Written and directed by Argentina's Damian Szifron, this brilliant black comedy will make you laugh or drive you crazy. Maybe a little of both."
0,Fresh,It's a high-concept premise that's initially employed to impressively engrossing effect by filmmakers Caroline Labrche and Steeve Lonard...
0,Fresh,Anyone looking for a bit of adult drama on the big screen in the midst of summer's comic-book heroes should consider A Better Life.
1,Rotten,The boy wants to dig for mystery! The girl wants him to stay home and do taxes! No amount of thoughtful dialogue is going to redeem that setup.
0,Fresh,Not just a riveting crime drama but also an excellent showcase of Tom Hardy's talent.
0,Fresh,"Dear Lemon Lima is a quirky beauty of a film with its cotton-candy colors, Miranda July-esque sensibility, and its embracing of alienation as a source of creativity."
0,Fresh,"It's an experiment that mostly works, but there are moments when it's clear that the task of finding new areas of ""Star Wars"" to play with is a bit too much for director Gareth Edwards to handle."
1,Rotten,"There are the makings of a great comedy here, but you will not find more than scattered hints of it."
0,Fresh,Ozu's most charming foray into comedy since his silent days.
1,Rotten,Shot like a typically ugly Adam Sandler effort and so clumsily stitched together that it feels as if large plot chunks litter the editing-room floor ...
0,Fresh,"There's something weirdly effective about the artistic desperation, which includes inserts of chalkboard animation and to-the-camera testimonials."
0,Fresh,"Laugh-out-loud funny, emotionally engaging and superbly acted, this is a welcome return for one of Britain's best-loved comic characters."
1,Rotten,"Has enough arch élan, aspirational costumes, and irreverent soundtrack to provide some pleasure but ends up feeling surprisingly dull despite a premise that promises something more."
0,Fresh,"Fast Color really is a lovely, quiet movie... Lorraine Touissant steals the show as the matriarch of the family and Gugu Mbatha-Raw is as magnetic as ever as the lead."
0,Fresh,"One of the most lovable characters in movies is Lionel Barrymore's Vanderhoff. He's a smart, carefree guy who magically changes people's lives and gives them hope!"
1,Rotten,"A good-looking period piece folk parable with a fine climax, but lacking compelling performances or genuine horrific suspense."
1,Rotten,"Most of this stuff isn't worthy of the Farrelly brothers, let alone the Coen brothers."
0,Fresh,It'll make you miss him all over again.
1,Rotten,The film's a failure.
1,Rotten,...not even Robbie and stylish visuals can prevent this film from being a retread of just about everytrope of the hitman genre.
1,Rotten,"This movie is awful, but I had a really fun time watching it."
0,Fresh,[Adopt a Highway] demonstrates an acute awareness of emotional honesty.
0,Fresh,"a fun movie that doesn't make you think too hard, but has plenty of little jokes for those who pay attention,"
1,Rotten,"A lot of scenes of characters running from one place to another, things exploding for no reason, and empty dialogue exchanges about saving and/or destroying the world."
0,Fresh,"Arriving for the last month of the Pierson family's sojourn, James artfully captures the flavor of their yearlong stay."
0,Fresh,Don't let a premise that sounds as boring as a corporate board meeting keep you from catching what may be the year's best movie.
1,Rotten,A stellar cast and compelling final twist is not enough to redeem the languid pace or uncomplicated mystery behind Secret in Their Eyes.
1,Rotten,"The Oath appears to crave several things at once, all diametrically opposed."
0,Fresh,It's an amiable enough alternative to the summer's special effects blockbusters. Just don't expect a wild time.
1,Rotten,"The film is aiming for tough edges, but it's essentially very vanilla."
0,Fresh,Gaspar Noé is going to make you dance all night. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"The perfect final image to encapsulate the film: A kid in a wheelchair, lobotomized by brain surgery, sitting in an empty pool surrounded by unlikable skateboarders."
0,Fresh,...bold and elegant...
0,Fresh,"A thoroughly engrossing tale of conflicting agendas and thwarted ambition. In its verve and verisimilitude, the film recalls such classics of political cinema as Z and The Battle of Algiers."
0,Fresh,Forte and Peake excel in a notable debut from Green that marks her out as a director to watch.
1,Rotten,"Much like this hero, who is confused and lacks a center, Stone's epic story does not have a core to its vision, too often drifting aimlessly through time and space."
0,Fresh,"If Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was Burton's big picture for 2005, this is his miniature."
0,Fresh,The Bourne Supremacy offers cool thrills and explosive action.
0,Fresh,Mary Queen of Scots may span a few years of the queen's life but actress Saoirse Ronan delivers a commanding performance as Scottish royalty.
1,Rotten,"David Tennant [plays the role] with conviction and a nice Glaswegian drawl, but the film is a dodgy business that makes things up -- including a pregnant girlfriend (Elisabeth Moss) -- for no good reason."
0,Fresh,The end result is a passable thriller that could (and should) have been so much better...
0,Fresh,"The film bears comparison to Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon and Prince Of The City for its sense of place and time, and to Coppola's first Godfather for its depiction of a man who places himself at a moral crossroads in defence of his family."
0,Fresh,"Ash Is Purest White is a soul-flooding marvel that will make you feel so many things all at once, which is just one of many reasons it's so remarkable."
1,Rotten,"This here is a violent Southern soap with delusions of respectability, and it's a pity it tried to put on such fancy airs."
1,Rotten,"With obvious international marketing pressure to make his next movie, y'know, a little less Thai, director Prachya Pinkaew has followed up his brilliant Ong Bak with an ineptly edited, badly scripted and atrociously dubbed pudding."
1,Rotten,"It's like an art-house 'Human Centipede.' While it hints at some interesting ideas, it just comes down to a crazy doctor."
1,Rotten,A textbook example of a director prizing himself over his material.
1,Rotten,An uneven adaptation that doesn't know whether it wants to be a thriller or a satire of social media.
0,Fresh,One of the undisputed classics of modern international film.
0,Fresh,"Doesn't redefine the rom-com, but it's a fine example of the genre."
0,Fresh,This edgy psychological horror frays the senses as intensely as anything experienced inA Quiet Place.
0,Fresh,"The end result is a nerve-rattling entertainment flavoured by vigorous, deeply felt polemic."
0,Fresh,"The true strength of The Christmas Chronicles is not in its conventional plotting, but the relentless sense of silliness and fun it brings to the format."
0,Fresh,"With Life of Pi, Lee takes on a not-so-crouching tiger to bring audiences a wondrously enthralling adventure fable."
0,Fresh,"An absorbing, fascinating and ethically complex film that questions whether an artist's personal life should be open for exploration."
0,Fresh,A tense urban drama about two gutsy undercover cops who enjoy their improvised lives of danger and surprises.
0,Fresh,"There's fun to be had, but there's also a few chapters worth skipping through."
0,Fresh,"Campanella uses the twin genres of the thriller and the romance, as well as twin narratives of punishment eluded and love unfulfilled, to give vividly palatable form to his themes of memory, justice and loss."
0,Fresh,"""Ant-Man"" is far too restrained to stand out amongst its peers, too careful to leave a lasting mark of its own. Its pleasures are real, but nearly as small as its hero."
0,Fresh,"It begs us to let go. And when you do, you realize that Gilliam's vision coalesces more as the movie progresses. Filmmakers are dreamers, after all, and reality sucks, so who wouldn't want to be caught up in delusions of grandeur every now and then?"
0,Fresh,"The result is an entertaining mess: lively and stylish, but frustratingly inconsequential."
1,Rotten,It's a frustrating complication of a movie with a sprawling story and grand ambitions -- and some truly grand acting -- that stumbles almost as often as it soars. Bummer.
1,Rotten,"Despite Denzel giving it his best shot, Roman J. Israel, Esq. never passes the bar."
1,Rotten,"After an hour and a half of mechanical 10-minute action cycles that start with, ""Maybe we're safe now, for the moment,"" and end with ""Aaaah! Run!"" the pattern gets as wearying as the level of emotional brutality."
0,Fresh,"It's the texture Mills brings to his characters that completely sells ""20th Century Women,"" securing a rich understanding of personality to go along with his more artful take on the flow of life."
0,Fresh,"When it hits, like a hysterically raunchy dry humping scene, Bad Teacher is a funny overachiever, though with a bit more effort it could've have won gold stars."
0,Fresh,'Rage' ends up as a bloody cautionary tale about how revenge served hot can backfire. It also reminds us that violence breeds violence. Not a bad message in today's world.
1,Rotten,"There's nothing new about the film, including its basic problem: a cast of talented actors cut off at the knees by stilted, cliched writing."
0,Fresh,"Solidly effective addition to Britain's social realism tradition, elevated by excellent performances by the young leads and some unexpectedly poetic touches."
1,Rotten,The Art of Racing in the Rain doesn't offer anything new and it won't become a memorable movie. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"What you saw in 1974 is pretty much what you get here, an audience pleaser that isn't a particular laugh-riot but will certainly keep you in the game."
0,Fresh,A major reason Nolan has become one of the premier filmmakers in the industry is because he never casts an actor that isn't completely deserving of the role.
0,Fresh,It will be a classic for years to come.
0,Fresh,"Some of the characters come from life, others are invented. The sterling actors in ""Pride"" draw no such distinction."
0,Fresh,"..A film that is entirely made up of foreshadowing, about this skinny, pale, portrait artist, before he would be the mad icon we think of him as today."
1,Rotten,"Less a cleverly spun story than a disjointed collection of shockeroos, surrounding a few ghoulishly effective moments with overcooked plot twists and in-your-face vulgarity."
0,Fresh,"It's enjoyable to listen to them bicker then bond, not because of what they're saying but because of their gifts as performers."
1,Rotten,"There's a lot happening here, perhaps too much."
1,Rotten,"Wilson does his callow good-guy routine (if you close your eyes you'd swear he was his brother, Owen) and Thurman looks as if she'd rather be stalking prey in Kill Bill."
1,Rotten,Turgid and pointless.
1,Rotten,"When the movie slows down to catch its breath, there's very little of the heart and soul -- and wry wit -- that make the Riordan books so beloved."
0,Fresh,"Werner Herzog isn't interested in patriotism as product placement, like other directors might be. Though uncommonly somber, ""Dawn"" is still an engrossing prison-break film. It's not ""The Great Escape."" It's ""The Sheer, Dumb Luck Escape."""
0,Fresh,"What makes it so effectively terrifying is not an urban legend that could spark an ill-advised, teenage-led hunt nor an array of ominous visuals; it is far simpler than that. It is the thought of finding yourself in Ripley's position."
1,Rotten,Makes you hate the day. Isn't Garry Marshall (76) too old for a fluffy romantic comedy for teens? Lots of stars get paid for 3 days of easy work.
1,Rotten,"Despite a great cast and an interesting premise, Proof feels more like an outline for a movie than the real thing."
0,Fresh,"Carolla is winning in The Hammer, which evokes Rocky and just about every other lovable-loser sports movie while showing enough comic originality to hold interest throughout."
1,Rotten,"Clement is better-suited as a foil to Conchord-like absurdity, where it works as a droll counterweight."
0,Fresh,A work of consummate skill which kicks into high gear when the focus turns from widespread civil unrest to the very specific.
1,Rotten,"When you make a film with Melissa McCarthy, Maya Rudolph, Joel McHale, and Elizabeth Banks, and there's maybe one mild chuckle spread out amongst the four of them, something is wrong."
1,Rotten,"Without Poots, ""Mobile Homes"" would be a rough sit."
0,Fresh,"Park Chan-wook focused on a female character and created a unique amalgam of black humor, blasphemous irony, extreme violence, which at times, is turned on children, and liberating humanism, chiefly depicted in the final sequence of collective revenge"
0,Fresh,"With good management of that personal will called ""suspension of disbelief"", The Girl in the Spider's Web is an enjoyable action film and, so, we can value the prized work of [director] Fede Alvarez. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"An overworked, very old and very tired warhorse. Glossy, ponderous, predictable."
0,Fresh,"Though it does get ugly, it's also paradoxically beautiful in its raw sincerity."
0,Fresh,The film benefits from a phenomenal central performance by Lopez de Ayala.
0,Fresh,"an ""attack of total altruism"" embedded in a slightly simplistic movie, fronted with terrific actors."
1,Rotten,"While these characters were amusing the first time around, Phillips and his screenwriters don't bring much new to the party."
0,Fresh,"If Up has a fault, it's merely that it's following in the footsteps of Wall-E, which was possibly the best animated film of the decade."
0,Fresh,'It's unfortunate that what should be an emotionally-engaging film is so completely unaffecting'
0,Fresh,"As a lavish spectacle, this historical epic takes us back to the great days of King Vidor or Joseph L Mankiewicz, when sets were framed by incidental stars."
1,Rotten,"Would I recommend The Night Sitter? Only if you're playing a gag on a friend and want to subject them to a really bad time, but other than that, save your precious time and do anything else."
0,Fresh,"Adonis and Rocky make one of the year's best cinematic pairings, their transition from strangers to acquaintances to partners to friends to something so much more absolutely exquisite."
1,Rotten,"If [basketball] must be mocked it deserves to be mocked well, and Semi-Pro, unfortunately, isn't up to the challenge."
1,Rotten,It more resembles a spindly kid running around and screaming for two hours before a hastily applied Hollywood ending shuts him up.
0,Fresh,"It might not become a classic you return to every December, but ultimately it remains a reliable Christmas romance that still manages to summon butterflies in your stomach where it counts."
0,Fresh,A pretty decent movie that even non-Trekkies would probably enjoy.
1,Rotten,"...an innocuous, thoroughly forgettable comedy..."
1,Rotten,"Jaws the Revenge, the fourth in a series of monster shark epics, is dead in the water."
0,Fresh,"You may feel trapped in a Saturday Night Live skit part of the time; the silly plot doesn't hang together well, and too many bawdy jokes misfire. Nevertheless, a sweetness pervades the film, which provides a generous view of human nature."
1,Rotten,Overall...pretty terrible-a cheekily self-aware 'Mystery Science Theater'-ready bit of madness that's nevertheless interesting for its ingenious low-budget pictorial pizzazz.
0,Fresh,"Francis Ford Coppola returns to form with his richest, most enrapturing film since Apocalypse Now. The black-and-white cinematography alone is as intoxicating as a bottle of the director's finest red."
0,Fresh,"The result is an affectionate, suspenseful and moving look at ingenuity, fandom and friendship."
0,Fresh,That such an incredible human being ceased to exist because of the stupidity of some overly boisterous troops will make you shake your head in sorrow and disgust.
0,Fresh,"Furthering its genre irregularity, it employs no narration to guide the viewer, and each shot is carefully static and composed. Its central scene, even, is a fabricated element in what is largely a non-fiction film."
1,Rotten,"For the filmmakers, it's all about pandering. And for this group of outstanding actors it's a colossal waste of their time, like a molecular scientist working at McDonalds."
0,Fresh,The Impossible is a magnificent survival drama. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,The story of the polyamorous trio who created D.C.'s iconic Amazonian hero doesn't skimp on the kinky sex - or the sense of female empowerment. You'll never look at Wonder Woman in the same way again.
1,Rotten,It's the stuff Mystery Science Theater 3000s are made of.
1,Rotten,"A cynical, perfunctorily directed, guileless, sexless and artless re-tread of the novel - the worst kind of fan, and potential franchise, service."
0,Fresh,"Follows a rather predictable, well-worn path, but the sheer joy of performing on the actors' parts sells the film as a whole."
0,Fresh,"A riveting piece of suspense and action, and one of the strongest horror films in recent memory."
1,Rotten,"Earnest, old-fashioned and undeniably dull."
0,Fresh,"Penn's direction is amazingly sharp and intuitive, full of masterful touches that give an epic dimension and scope to the parable."
0,Fresh,"Vanity Fair is an ambitious film that seems at times to mistrust its own reach, but for all its flaws, makes for a worthy start to the painfully long awards season."
0,Fresh,The type of Hollywood action film that had all but disappeared and is a refreshing entry to the genre. [Full Review in Spanish]

0,Fresh,Glen Close and a passel of young talent collide in a pot-boiling web of personal crises in the artistic bowels of Manhattan.
0,Fresh,Bad choices and immoral acts go unpunished in dark comedy.
0,Fresh,"Imagine the rowdy comedic timing of a Preston Sturges romp mixed with the subversive glamor of Ernest Lubitsch's patented ""touch."" Yet, beneath the glorious pomp and circumstance lies a very real conflict of cultural identity and family."
0,Fresh,"See Toni Erdmann, and once you have, check out Ade's previous film, Everyone Else, which is also terrific."
0,Fresh,"It would be trite to say ""Shoplifters"" steals the audience's heart. It's also inaccurate, because Kore-Eda and his charming ensemble cast of rogues put in the hard work to earn the audience's respect and affection."
0,Fresh,"The apex of noir style, offering up electric visions of sin, salvation, and sexual mania."
0,Fresh,"While it all feels like a step down from the grandeur of Leone's spaghetti Westerns, that's part of the point, and part of the charm."
0,Fresh,"Created by Disney, lauding Walt Disney, about the creation of a Disney classic, it has much the same effect as a trip to Disneyland: It's a heartwarming, sweet, kind, and fantastical ride that works best if you never wonder what's behind the curtain."
1,Rotten,Merchants of Doubt's lack of independent opinion and poor probing of its skeptic subjects makes this doc rather inconsequential.
0,Fresh,Everything but the enchanted kitchen sink shows up in the sprawling fairy tale Stardust.
0,Fresh,"Hard to Be a God, to say the least, can be seen as a flexible metaphor for the unchanging state of both Soviet and post-Soviet Russia."
1,Rotten,"Stylized visuals add some spice, but they cannot overcome the formulaic and obvious screenplay, which is of no help to a film that is structured as a mystery."
0,Fresh,Come to camp but skip the swim lessons.
0,Fresh,"A documentary that exposes bigotry, fear, and anger as toxic forces in a dying village in Bulgaria."
0,Fresh,An enduring film property with an unforgettable catch phrase ('Klaatu barada nikto')...[and] socially conscious themes. [Blu-ray]
0,Fresh,"Writer-directors Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz keep the tension building throughout and there is a general air of disturbing creepiness, although there are diversionary slips in the script that are a slightly too obvious."
0,Fresh,"It may be a Hollywood comedy, but it's one that feels beautifully alive."
0,Fresh,"... the film is bursting with astonishing old footage, hip tunes, vivid interviews and you-couldn't- make-it-up anecdotes."
0,Fresh,"Whannell delivers a refreshingly modern take on H.G. Wells' story by incorporating technology, twisting the origin of the classic villain."
0,Fresh,"From its opening frames, Hereditary digs its claws into you and doesn't let go."
0,Fresh,"Restraint is this movie's mystery and its miracle. No matter how gruesome it is, mercifully, it's always holding back."
1,Rotten,The film's focus is too easily distracted by celebrity and turns less documentary and more fawning love letter to an industry already in love with itself.
1,Rotten,"The City of Angels stays more interesting throughout than a couple of other characters do, including a wishy-washy, hotshot lawyer (Colin Farrell) and a rights activist (Carmen Ejogo), popping in and out again as a possible love interest for Denzel."
0,Fresh,"Nadine Labaki's extraordinary neorealist film left me gutted, and grateful to be allowed such an emotional response."
0,Fresh,Bloody brilliant.
1,Rotten,Pure cotton candy -- entirely non-nutritious but too sweet and pretty for young people to resist.
0,Fresh,"It's clumsy at times, and amazingly lucid and potent at others."
0,Fresh,"It smartly captures his dynamic personality both through the words of those who knew him, and more importantly, through his enduring music."
0,Fresh,"It's as if someone snuck a hefty slug of bourbon into your cherry cola; all of the sugar and flavor and fizz you expect from a well-made comic-book movie are there, but there's something a little more grown-up going on behind them."
0,Fresh,Testosterone at its most tragic.
0,Fresh,"Although he's the youngest Spider-Man, Holland has a classic farceur's energy and focus (he's a Brit, after all), and his Spider-Man is never a cartoon."
1,Rotten,"Howard and Mac play well off each other, the kids are fine and the film makes the points it wants to make. The only thing more you can ask is that it not be a paint-by-numbers approach, as this is."
0,Fresh,It's an effective film mostly because it has a sense of humor and Travolta is convincing as the unlikely hero fighting against political corruption.
1,Rotten,Rubber Suit City once again. For 'Zillians only.
0,Fresh,"Some killing, but most violence is PG-13."
0,Fresh,"Anytime you have a rattlesnake attached to a machine gun and voiced by Bill Nighy, you can sign me up. Cleverly written, not for kids and not in 3D. Go see it. Now."
0,Fresh,"Tips the scale as an ambitious middleweight...If it doesn't quite go the distance, it still may blow you away with a powerful combination of grit and realism."
0,Fresh,The Sea Inside is a heartbreaking triumph. And Alejandro Amenabar is poised to become one of cinema's great talents.
0,Fresh,"Based on events that would shape the city and the lives within it, the film is suitably small in nature in its intimate look at one persons tragedy and then following triumph."
0,Fresh,It's an oddball movie about a bunch of oddballs.
1,Rotten,"This movie takes absolutely zero chances. It's one of those safe, middle-of-the-road movies that conservative Uncle Fred (who sees 2 movies a year) can recommend to you during Thanksgiving. Thanks Fred!"
0,Fresh,Gast's presentation is super-slick and surprisingly dynamic for a film concerned with still images.
0,Fresh,"The picture can be squishy and obvious. Yet it works, thanks to Gavin Hood's straightforward, sensitive direction and his star's emotionally charged performance."
0,Fresh,"Despite traversing familiar territory, the two performers help to modulate the humor and pathos without resorting to clichés."
0,Fresh,"A frisky, fast-moving, funny Western in which a rifle is the apple of a cowboy's eye."
1,Rotten,"Shockingly, this flood is less an allergic reaction to any global catastrophe and more the result of what happens when a studio has too much cash to blow on a wild effects sequence."
0,Fresh,El humor y el absurdo en un drama ligero que toca temas con fuerza.
0,Fresh,"It's not until the heartbreaking denouement you realise how immersive Tokyo Story is, and how it snuck up on you and worked its way into your heart."

0,Fresh,"Often very funny, but it is also surprisingly moving at times."
0,Fresh,"It's a total tearjerker, with a powerhouse performance from Weaver."
0,Fresh,Dig Two Graves is a solid horror joint full of atmospheric tension and enough peculiarities to set it apart.
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, complacency overshadows creativity in the film, which seems to pander to mainstream expectations instead of taking risks."
1,Rotten,"Jerky motion, blurred action beats -- a clever conceit ruined by sloppy animation."
0,Fresh,"Tuschi collates the evidence masterfully - TV footage, documents, interviews with ex-colleagues - to substantiate what much of the world is already convinced of."
0,Fresh,"A fluffy, comedic sequel to CLOSER... breezy, delightful and bitterly hilarious."
1,Rotten,A moderately entertaining slice of sci-fi action that doesn't really work as idea-driven drama.
0,Fresh,"A tiny, lean, stripped-down tale of survival unleashed into a wasteland overrun with blockbuster giants, it plays David to the many Goliaths, offering a reminder that less is more in an age when more is always mistaken for more."
1,Rotten,Hush will always find a place at sadists' film festivals.
1,Rotten,"Although Hector goes to places that are actually on a map, in reality each trip is a journey to Clicheland, where stereotypical characters do stereotypical things, for Hector's observation, excitement and, sometimes, disappointment."
0,Fresh,"One is always in good hands with Thompson, even in this kiddie franchise...for the kids, there's not only the sobering reminder that they're works in progress but also lots of...fairy-tale magic, with a touch of Babe's farm charm."
0,Fresh,"Purists may have a field day with All Is True, and it does have a tendency to lag, but I found myself thinking about it days after I'd seen it."
1,Rotten,"There's an old saying: 'I wrote you a long letter because I didn't have time to write a short one.' In the case of Mad Money, I'll write a short review because the movie won't sustain a long one. (It barely sustains itself.)"
0,Fresh,The story itself holds a sense of stark reality and raw emotions mixed with a sense of flight and fantasy.
0,Fresh,"On paper, Ira and Abby sounds like a sitcom (in fact, it sounds like Dharma & Greg). But intelligence and fine acting shoves it up several notches."
0,Fresh,"""Maybe even Jack Nicholson couldn't do a better job than Murray playing this improbable hero - something that probably isn't going to be forgotten come Oscar time."""
0,Fresh,"McKay's script (co-written with Charles Randolph) bounces from dark hilarity to genuine pathos (McKay doesn't neglect the people this affected the most), and the attention to detail is admirable."
0,Fresh,Classic '50s sci-fi flick is campy fun.
1,Rotten,"It was filmed in and around the World Trade Center, and the subsequent cuts, reshoots and sleights of hand designed to obscure that fact prove devastating."
0,Fresh,"With the exception of Mulligan, whose sharp-edged performance begins to overpower the otherwise muted, rather mannered film, it feels too neatly mapped as a whole."
1,Rotten,"A mediocre third-generation copy of an idea that wasn't very new to begin with, and the addition of a supposedly rational explanation to the mix proves more hindrance than help."
0,Fresh,"This is clearly an impressive piece of work, but it borders on self-indulgence and its appeal is not that broad."
1,Rotten,"It's a mindless, occasionally entertaining entry into the genre but it brings nothing fresh or innovative to the table. It's too bad because the first film was so good and Fresnadillo looked like a promising choice to take over."
1,Rotten,"An improvement on its predecessor...a workmanlike job, if an uninspired one."
0,Fresh,Some good country music and some people you care about make this film likable if nothing flashy. But Bridges's characterization is first rate.
0,Fresh,Borat hunts for neo-Nazis!
1,Rotten,"All Headshot needed to do was stay lean and mean, and yet the only-there-as-an-excuse-for-the-violence plot still feels like it's getting in the way."
0,Fresh,The Lady in the Car With Glasses and a Gun is like a movie-shaped sudoku puzzle: an irresistible time-suck that's more fun to puzzle over than it is to solve.
0,Fresh,"Seriously funny and very much of-the-moment, Long Shot showcases strong on-screen chemistry between Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron while raising the bar on the romantic comedy."
1,Rotten,Oddball is a confused political critique disguised as a mediocre Australian family film.
0,Fresh,"It takes a while to get used to the fractured narrative, but once done it is easy to put your mind on autopilot and go with the offbeat characters and events."
0,Fresh,An entertaining and inventive ride tailor-made for the summer movie season.
0,Fresh,"Tom Hooper's film is a handsomely made, well-acted story that, for the most part, wins hearts by transforming a potentially mega-watt historical story into a low-key dramedy and mismatched buddy movie."
1,Rotten,"Oh, how painfully incompetent this movie is."
0,Fresh,"Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Palme d'Or winner Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives is a unique and mesmerising piece of filmmaking, but it won't be to everyone's taste."
0,Fresh,A mood of utter chaos rarely makes you feel like everyday citizens are this close to snapping.
0,Fresh,"First and foremost it's great fun, secondly it offers pretty strong feminist role models..."
0,Fresh,as intriguing and compelling as it is frustrating
0,Fresh,Surprise! Love and Basketball is a movie that deftly combines a basketball obsession with a heartfelt love story.
1,Rotten,"It's all very ambitious -- and thought-provoking. But, at only 92 minutes, one wishes the script had been further developed and the film executed with more clarity."
1,Rotten,"'Fantastic Four' could have been hot, but in the hands of some studio blockheads, the premise is stretched so thin that it disappears."
0,Fresh,"As Vera, the rebellious, moneyed young woman whose dream of graduating from Oxford is deferred when the war breaks out, Alicia Vikander is such a ferociously intuitive performer that you can't take your eyes off her."
0,Fresh,"Isn't quite as on-target as [Guest's] previous efforts, but his talented troupe again delivers more giddy laughs than just about any other comedy out there."
0,Fresh,"While it isn't a terribly exciting conclusion to a richly-textured saga, it's the little moments along the way that make El Camino a heartfelt final chapter in a great character's story."
0,Fresh,"A monster movie-disaster film hybrid that doesn't take itself too seriously. The combination works beautifully making the piece wildly enjoyable and surprisingly believable, too."
0,Fresh,Hits the high notes even though the tone of sorrow and frustration does not vary.
0,Fresh,"Reflecting on life inevitably leads a person down twisting, unforeseeable paths. Desplechin captures that sensation with deft, chaotic skill. His film may be fundamentally messy, but there's real beauty in his contemplative clutter."
1,Rotten,Lurking somewhere inside the high-concept sloppiness of Accepted is the kernel of a solid comedy.
1,Rotten,Suffers from a flat script and a low budget.
0,Fresh,"The adaptation of Turow's novel does a good job of presenting the evidence as needed, and no more than is needed, while allowing time for the characters to establish themselves."
1,Rotten,"The ensemble dramedy ""See You in Valhalla"" could be the death knell for dysfunctional family reunion movies. It's that bad."
0,Fresh,"Thanks to Vaughn, Favreau, and the stray sharp lines that pop out of everyone else, the film at least offers the lively sound of egos that still know how to swing."
0,Fresh,[Schlesinger] displays the best sense of Victorian time and place since David Lean in Great Expectations.

0,Fresh,"Essentially, this is a Scandinavian version of The Hangover, but maybe the planned American remake won't pretend to be something it's not."
0,Fresh,Costa-Gavras tells this heartbreaking tale of lost opportunity with an emotional restraint that makes it all the more powerful.
0,Fresh,"The...world-class band, the techno tricks and state-of-the-art effects, especially the Humphrey Bogart chase sequence, are stunning. It would have been a hell of a show."
0,Fresh,"Not the best of the most recent Disney upswing, but certainly an entertaining achievement."
0,Fresh,"Dylan Haggerty has written an eleventh-hour candidate for the funniest movie of 2007, that Gregg Araki has directed his finest film since 1997's Nowhere, and that Faris, flawless, rocks their inspired idiot odyssey in a virtuoso comedic turn."
1,Rotten,Where the film fails is in its commercial proclivity to centre the narrative trajectory around a fairly asinine updating of the Pip/Estella love-match into a soppy romance.
0,Fresh,Grabs for the gut by stoking primal understandings about our loving but tragically distant relationship with the wild.
0,Fresh,"AVATAR is not the kick-ass, mind-blowing James Cameron movie I was hoping for, but it's a perfectly serviceable sci-fi adventure that's well worth seeing"
0,Fresh,"Even if you don't think capitalism should be scrapped, we can agree that there are numerous abuses of the system that need to be stopped, and Moore does a great job of trying to document them."

0,Fresh,Passionate -- but mostly unremarkable -- filmmaking.
1,Rotten,"""Director Marc Abraham has difficulty connecting all the dots of what turns out to be a frustratingly episodic film. """
0,Fresh,"Fun and forgettable, Scream 4 is simply another piece of popcorn in the sequel snack pack."
0,Fresh,"But despite the script's imperfections, Please Stand By is harmless, enjoyable film that loves the kind of characters that are often overlooked by Hollywood (those on the spectrums, those at the extremes of fandom)."
0,Fresh,"Yael Hersonski's A Film Unfinished reclaims history, teaches a lesson about the reliability of images and raises unanswerable questions about complicity."
0,Fresh,"There are a lot of big, heady themes woven throughout the story, none of which are ever fully developed, but rather are left as tantalizing, ambiguous nods toward deeper philosophical wells."
0,Fresh,"But as much as his style and personal experience fuel the story, Melancholia doubly thrives as a vehicle for its actors, especially Kirsten Dunst."
0,Fresh,Touching story about how the spiritual practice of enthusiasm works wonders in the life of a man in prison.
0,Fresh,Is Sin City the most accomplished mediocre movie in recent history?
0,Fresh,"Unusually grim (for the multiplex) and ritualistic, with nice supernatural flourishes and an outcome that will surprise those unfamiliar with the original story."
0,Fresh,"Storytelling is important to Gadsby, and the biggest point she makes in the special is that we've been telling ourselves stories the wrong way."
0,Fresh,"Quinn is excellent as Seth. He's smart, he's sexy, and he lends a special spirit to his square-off with the Lord."
0,Fresh,"The contemporary music sequences are a distraction from the heart of the movie: truly astounding archival footage of speeches, marches, and demonstrations."
1,Rotten,"Asking serious questions about such movies usually is pointless, but how stupid do director Dewey Nicks and writer David H. Steinberg think women are?"
1,Rotten,"Mostly, we get a string of tame set-pieces, one-dimensional characterizations, odd continuity gaps, and heavy-handed attempts at feel-good sentiment."
0,Fresh,"If you're interested in engaging storytelling amidst some of the most visually striking cinematography and visual f/x work I've experienced, then I highly encourage you to seek out Monsters."
1,Rotten,"The acting throughout Thriller is distractingly bad. The actors each say their descriptive lines, wait a beat, and then their scene partner says the next descriptive line. There's no flow and no chemistry."
0,Fresh,"This Aussie thriller is all about characters -- interesting characters, and several of them could hold a movie on their own."
0,Fresh,"Chuckle, if you can, during the first few minutes; because after that laughter catches in the throat as the clammy hand of terror tightens its grip."
0,Fresh,"Remarkably elegant film from Ethan Hawke about his friend, classical pianist and sometime-composer Seymour Bernstein, is one of early delights of 2015."
1,Rotten,"At times the plot seems to exist merely to string together all these dance scenes ... Unfortunately, Five Dances feels more interested in the art than the artist."
0,Fresh,"Take Braveheart, Gladiator and Apocalypto, leave them to simmer in an iron-age pot and you've got The Eagle, a sword-swooshing slice of historical action that's plenty entertaining, if a touch familiar."
0,Fresh,"Extremely sophisticated in its visuals and in its narrative... if you get the chance to see Big Bad Wolves, eat it up."
1,Rotten,"In a way, Highwater is the antithesis of The Endless Summer, the film made by Brown's father, Bruce Brown, more than four decades ago."
1,Rotten,"If 'shrill & obnoxious' equalled 'funny', then we'd have something."
0,Fresh,"Director Jay Roach (who did, um, the Austin Powers movies) keeps the tone determinedly light, but the acting helps bring home how serious the stakes are."
1,Rotten,A funny frankenstein that's worth seeing just to point and laugh at.
0,Fresh,"Skyscraper is an unabashed genre film, perfect for filmgoers looking for spectacle over the story...even if it demands it's audiences to overlook one too many flaws."
0,Fresh,"The result is a devastating film, and an important one."
0,Fresh,"Winstead is good, Paul is great and Ponsoldt's film is solid, even going so far as to deliver a genuinely poignant final scene."
1,Rotten,"... For the most part, the twists and turns... are neither creepy nor fascinating."
0,Fresh,Phoenix delivers a mesmerizing performance and catapults into one of the best interpretations of Batman's most famous archenemy and an equally Oscar-worthy performance.
1,Rotten,should once and for all spell the end of Larry the Cable Guy's horrendous run of Hollywood hokum.
1,Rotten,"The film attempts to dodge already well-covered territory ... by going back further than the other films have, but then proceeds to suck all the fun out of it."
1,Rotten,The film has the same weaknesses and strengths as the novel. And its greatest weakness is that the main character is the least interesting and just about the least sympathetic.
0,Fresh,"The writing's clever, the humor's sharp, and the acting is outstanding all around."
0,Fresh,"A visual treat in every way, ""Hellboy II"" delivers on all cylinders."
0,Fresh,"Brilliant, brittle dialogue, three amazing female actors and a setting of the English court of Queen Anne (her reign was 1702-07) are enough to make this sumptuous, cynical and gorgeous film a worthwhile Oscar contender."
0,Fresh,Imagine Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry remade by a troubled Buddhist. The film is calm yet corrosive.
0,Fresh,"In keeping with the audience it is aimed at, the film is self-consciously cynical and insolent, and at the same time fundamentally romantic and seeking to be liked. The combination works surprisingly well, thanks to good ensemble acting."
0,Fresh,Dumb title? Certainly. Perfectly proportioned? Nope. True-to-life? Certainly not. An enjoyably quirky indie comedy? You bet.
0,Fresh,"Despite getting a critical hammering in the States, it turns out that romantic drama Labor Day isn't all that bad."
0,Fresh,"Arkadin was, according to one of his business rivals, ""a phenomenon of an age of dissolution and crisis."" The world of Mr. Arkadin aptly reflects such an age."
1,Rotten,"How is it remotely possible, that a film of such awkward amateurishness even be allowed to hit the screen?"
0,Fresh,"He does things his way, and he makes no apologies for having a snout. In fact, he's kind of smug about it."

0,Fresh,"An electrifying, horrifying and witty study of society and class wrapped up in a sci-fi action movie."
0,Fresh,"Thankfully, the cinematic adaptation bears a strong resemblance to the great early Simpsons episodes, with a consistent script, nonstop jokes, and lots & lots of Homer."
0,Fresh,"The last half more than makes up for what I thought was a draggy first half. I hesitate to call it ""Hitchcockian,"" because I think it's even better than that."
1,Rotten,"entertaining, and that's about the extent of it."
0,Fresh,"A moody, neo-noir-style psychological drama with thick, intertwined veins of tragedy, romantic obsession, legal consequence and revenge."
0,Fresh,"Christopher Nolan's existential sci-fi heist flick is always riveting, if not always comprehensible."

0,Fresh,Brings the original's watercolor illustrations to uncanny life with a harder edge than its gentle source material.
1,Rotten,"It tries for scale and scope, striving to say profound things about sexism...commenting as much about today's times as those of the film's period. A lot of it rings true...but it is done with a heavy hand."
0,Fresh,A jaunty film exploring all the wonderful ways to appreciate dogs.
1,Rotten,A town terrified of the shadows yet too stupid to turn on some lights.
0,Fresh,It's worth overlooking Lord of War's flaws.
1,Rotten,The best that can be said about the big-screen Bratz is that they are not nearly as appalling as their toy-shelf twins.
0,Fresh,"This exquisite pastel-colored, eye-popping example of hand-drawn animation is still very Japanese, aimed most specifically at children around the world -- but with a storytelling sophistication that adults will savor."
0,Fresh,"A gritty film noir about petty crooks on the US/Canadian border, Hammer builds a persuasive sense of desperation."
1,Rotten,"There are a few amusing moments, helped by subdued performances from Affleck and Gandolfini, but this is no Bad Santa despite its obvious ambition to play similar holiday tricks."
0,Fresh,"Sweetheart blends Survival Horror and Monster Movie tropes to create a small but effective supernatural thriller, resting upon the shoulders of Kiersey Clemons superb performance, delivering a crafty one girl show."
0,Fresh,"For the most part, this film is a fitting tribute to a great champion of films and filmmakers. It is an interesting look into Ebert's life, warts and all, and it packs a real emotional punch, like life itself."
0,Fresh,The thunder that follows the Superbad lightning.
0,Fresh,Oscar-winner Hopkins and Oscar-nominee Gosling snipe and bark and jaw and play with one another like two boxers sizing up their opponent right before unleashing a lethal right hook.

0,Fresh,"I read just now that this is the first sequel to any of his own films that Washington has agreed to star in. Having seen it, I'm not surprised."
1,Rotten,...a palpably needless vanity project that one endures more than one enjoys.
0,Fresh,"Docu about teen sentenced to jail; mature themes, violence."

1,Rotten,The film generates zero tension from what is implicitly marketed as a seismic battle of super heroes.
1,Rotten,"The cartoon is stuffed with exhausting visual mayhem. Some jokes land, but most kids over 10 will roll their eyes."
0,Fresh,High-end family entertainment.
0,Fresh,"A beautifully brutal work that pulls zero punches, gives zero damns, and willfully mucks around in the muddy moral waters that comprise war."
0,Fresh,"It's an incredibly intimate portrait, and one that feels more universal for its refusal to court a grander significance."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately unexciting remake of the 1984 junk-culture cult classic about a bunch of American teens who fight back after America is invaded by Communists. Yes, Communists... This could have been fun."
0,Fresh,"Certain plot points might seem far-fetched, but only until you think of similar things that have already happened, similar liberties that have been happily surrendered by users of popular networks."
0,Fresh,This is fairy tale stuff right out of the Brothers Grimm .... Think Dr. Seuss by way of Edward Gorey.
1,Rotten,White Boy Rick feels like a lot of misplaced bluster; a valley of flat peaks.
0,Fresh,The Cat's Meow is a purr-fect return to form for director Peter Bogdanovich. It's rich in the same flavor of his earlier films.
0,Fresh,"""[An] effed up tale of friendship for the ages."""
1,Rotten,"One can see splashes of Taymor's visual style..., but unless one is familiar with Shakespeare's play beforehand, ""The Tempest"" will be a confusing muddle, at times downright tedious."
0,Fresh,Edgy and Intriguing...the performances are rock solid
0,Fresh,"Eye-filling and lively, but it was better on the stage"
0,Fresh,"Down-to-earth personalities and the honest, simple, funny dialogue are spot-on."

0,Fresh,"Duvall does wonders with his underwritten supporting part, bringing wit to the gaming table."
1,Rotten,The answers are far more appealing than the questions.
1,Rotten,"Though its running time is brief and a lot of the writing is sharp, the tug-of-war between a onetime literary lion and his wide-eyed No. 1 fan lacks the necessary tension to make the drama's outcome matter."
0,Fresh,"More than the sum of its terrific parts, this beautifully crafted tale about the pain of love deftly reconciles two disparate stories - with stellar results."
1,Rotten,"Fine acting aside, this is a story that should have remained untold."
0,Fresh,"""Beyond the Visible"" bristles with the excitement of discovery and also with the impatience that recognition has taken so long. It refreshes the eyes and the mind."
1,Rotten,"Stultifying from start to finish, this mess of a movie is supremely incoherent -- plot-, dialogue- and character-wise."
0,Fresh,"It's not as clever and absorbing as 'Match Point' or 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,' but it's still smart, sophisticated and entertaining. 'Irrational Man,' the latest from Woody Allen, isn't a whodunit. It's more of a whocangetawaywithit"
0,Fresh,"The film is at once heartfelt and funny, farcical and sincere, and packed with performances that pull off that difficult balancing act. In short, it's a masterpiece."
1,Rotten,In Secret probes these troubled minds from an arm's-length remove.
0,Fresh,"Beyond its value as a documentary, it's a statement of principle."
0,Fresh,"In this live action movie, with talking animals and a good deal of clever computer-generated imagery, Julia Roberts does the talking for Charlotte and only confirmed arachnophobes such as myself will resist her charms."
1,Rotten,"One of the 10 worst films of its decade. It's quite possible I have never before seen a motion picture that held so much contempt for everyone and everything -- for its audience, for its characters, even for the film medium itself."
1,Rotten,"The problem is Gaiman's story, which keeps accumulating otherworldly mythology but doesn't establish a clear line of action in the home stretch."
0,Fresh,"After seeing 'Shrek the Third' I thought I was done with this movies. I thought wrong. They brought back the story. And now they can put the series to bed, happily ever after."
0,Fresh,"A funny, gentle and honestly sentimental movie that is easily one of the best of the year in any category, and very possibly the best movie about sport ever made in this country."
0,Fresh,"Three years ago, (Derek)Tsang made ""Soul Mate,"" an enchanting tale about female friendship that offered an engrossing look at modern, urban China. Yet that film isn't quite adequate preparation for the emotional wallop of ""Better Days."""
1,Rotten,Even a top Israeli dance troupe can't rescue this undercooked and umpteenth retelling on the heroic 1976 raid on Entebbe to rescue hijacked airline passengers.
0,Fresh,"The thought that these animals are digital creations, crafted via CGI from human actors' motion-capture acting, does not occur until close-ups reveal humanlike expressions. Otherwise, the scenes seem to show living, breathing beings in their habitat."
0,Fresh,"The movie has some of the braggadocio of its white-trash hero, building to its competitive climax as if it were a gladiatorial sporting event, and it carried me all the way."
1,Rotten,"The digital animation ranges from competent to clunky, the jokes too often feel tossed-off and random, and the movie too often descends into dullness, only to be yanked back from the abyss by the goat."
0,Fresh,"Idealistic, fresh and entertaining,Rushmore is unpredictable fun in a world where roles are reversed and are privy to watch the result."
1,Rotten,"It has all the elements for a crackerjack neo-noir about an apothecary who foolishly attempts to fill a prescription for murder. But there's something missing, namely a script that's little more than a formulaic potion."
1,Rotten,Stuber: An illogical buddy comedy with hopes of confronting toxic masculinity that often swerves to avoid blindly hitting plot holes.
0,Fresh,"There are enough wild car chases, cool explosions and funny moments to keep your attention, and some of the stunts will make you flinch."
0,Fresh,"While never sacrificing any of the hard-knock authenticity and specificity of his characters and their milieu, he has crafted a deeply felt film that can speak to and empower just about any audience."
0,Fresh,"The irony here is that everyone who is disappointed with this film, everyone who didn't get what they expected, are those that would be clowned by Andy consistently. So a lot of people are going to dislike Forman's film. So what?"
1,Rotten,"It's not a totally unpleasant way to spend an escapist evening, but considering the talent involved, 'MiB3' should have been more out of this world."
1,Rotten,Science fiction blasphemy: Not even explosive set pieces or endless Terminator-on-Terminator fistfights can distract from the nonsense.
0,Fresh,"The story is astonishing enough on its own, and The Imposter succeeds in enhancing its immediacy and intensity."
1,Rotten,Makes a mockery of the movie that coulda/shoulda been.

0,Fresh,"Matchett, Schiff and Naga all contribute solid support, while Krause is downright exceptional as the nondescript accountant suddenly falling into media-fueled paranoia."
1,Rotten,"It was immediately apparent that there was a slick formulaic surface clinging to this cinematic road trip. And for me, that was a turnoff."
1,Rotten,Almost everything about The Family Stone is so schematic and prefabricated that it should come with its own easy-to-follow blueprint.
0,Fresh,"While it is definitely geared more towards the social media generation, anyone with bittersweet memories of school life will laugh and wince in equal measure."

1,Rotten,Saying that The Cradle of Life is better than the original is on par with saying that sudden painless death is preferable to expiring by a long and painful disease.
0,Fresh,Is Morgan Freeman the greatest American actor?
0,Fresh,"The words of ""Stronger Than Me"" reverberate through this devastating film... we can't help but wonder if things would have turned out very differently had Winehouse's family, friends, lovers, collaborators and business partners been a little stronger."
0,Fresh,A very short and cheerfully scruffy comedy-thriller by the Duplass brothers.
0,Fresh,"As unexpectedly enchanting as its title is initially perplexing, ""My Life as a Zucchini"" is short but oh so satisfyingly bittersweet, an example of the kind of movie magic that's always hard to find."
1,Rotten,It is quite possible to hate Cats and deplore Sex and still enjoy this movie.
1,Rotten,"...the film loves itself so much it renders itself beautiful, but utterly shallow."
1,Rotten,"If Honey were three minutes long, and had no dialogue, it'd be completely entertaining."
0,Fresh,"A film so rich in texture, depth of emotion, and subtext that it feels a bit wrong to review it after only a single viewing."
1,Rotten,"The hero of ""Sinister"" is almost unaccountably dumb. So, unfortunately, is the movie."
0,Fresh,Totally satisfying!
0,Fresh,"[The characters] seek an appreciation for what they've endured-[not excuses]. Their pain isn't the product of the other's joy, but a universally shared point of connection."

0,Fresh,"Intermittently strong, often darkly humorous but ultimately uneven."
1,Rotten,The Intruder is an unintentionally hilarious cartoon of a home invasion thriller
0,Fresh,It cannot fail to move and disturb with a story so compelling you can't turn away even if you know the outcome. Maybe especially if you know the outcome.

1,Rotten,This film wastes a lot of good actors.
0,Fresh,"It's simply one of the best science fiction films in recent memory, and (thankfully) one that is completely and totally human...and often disturbingly prescient."
0,Fresh,The American version of Human Capital (directed by Marc Meyers) is not as stylishly filmed as director Paolo Virzì's Italian version ... All of the actors do a very good job with their roles.
1,Rotten,"This third installment could easily be dismissed as too little, too late, if only it weren't in fact too much, too late."
0,Fresh,A smart if slow-boiling suspense thriller!
0,Fresh,"...an impressive, nuanced drama that tugs at the heartstrings in witty, poignant fashion. Essentially, Abe & Phil's Last Poker Game is a nice farewell for Landau's long and distinguished career"
0,Fresh,"Noah manages the miracle of Crowe shouting at the heavens without looking absurd, not to mention the miracle of bringing the Bible movie back to life, and making it watchable and contemplative."
1,Rotten,Terminator Genisys fails to provide what this series has needed for a full quarter-century: the soul of a new machine.
0,Fresh,"The Koran is part of the battleground for the film's moral compass, and while it may overshoot the average multiplex goer's comfort zone for a spy movie, it engages on a serious level"

0,Fresh,"That rarest of cinematic treats, an entertaining and stimulating movie, with a superb script, rich characters and a cracking cast."
1,Rotten,"... sorry, Charlie, this crowded ""Angels"" episode plays more slick than shrewd."
1,Rotten,The script that Nicholas Klein has conjured from Bono's idea is a quicksand that sucks down a solid cast.
1,Rotten,"The movie would rather jolly along an action audience than play fair with its material, and so we're treated to the standard obligatory bankrupt action dreck: kinetic energy on autopilot."
0,Fresh,"The most explosive, intense Star Trek yet, and it's so relentless you don't have time to worry about what's missing."

1,Rotten,The film is not as good as the Eric Clapton music in the background.
1,Rotten,"Shyamalan's plotting is spotty, especially in the less-than-satisfying finale, but his textural touches are strong."
1,Rotten,"A collective of narrative and stylistic cliches, ""Rebel in the Rye"" is lousy with hagiography, stripping Salinger of any danger, allure or mystery, and making him instead just another insufferable poet-philosopher in your MFA class."
0,Fresh,No one can play mean better than The Divine Ms. M.
1,Rotten,Director Kevin Macdonald can't begin to approach the paranoid genre mastery seen in the films of John Frankenheimer and Alan Pakula.
0,Fresh,"Inside the arena, it's a fantastic action movie, but outside, it's starchy and pretentious."
0,Fresh,"Even though fails to create a deep psychological study of a character as attractive as Jesus, Garcia's film is an honest meditation about loneliness, the dilemmas of freedom, obedience and filial responsibility. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"It provides such an insight into the darkest, deepest-darkest inner workings of the comic mind."
0,Fresh,The characters here are refreshingly complex.
1,Rotten,"So preoccupied with score-settling, it is frankly rather embarrassing, like that obnoxious relative at Thanksgiving dinner who insists on revisiting each and every perceived slight."
1,Rotten,Pandorum isn't all that bad. It's a perfectly middle-of-the-road genre flick not quite worthwhile enough to wholeheartedly recommend. And the creatures know kung-fu.
0,Fresh,"A surprisingly touching, if not particularly original, dramedy ..."
1,Rotten,"This could be interesting stuff, but [director Jan] de Bont just has his actors say the lines and move on to the next stunt."

0,Fresh,"Chet Baker's life played out in much the same way, but he came to terms with the fact that he was born to be blue. His self-awareness over his self-fulling prophecy shows in his music as he uses his trumpet as an extension of his own emotional turmoil."

1,Rotten,"Initially intriguing detective tale of ancient Rome hops genres into fantasy, with a strange manic-preacher-dream-boy seduction of its pragmatic protagonist."
0,Fresh,"Boyle's film is dynamic and alive, a celebration of life instead of a contemplation of death...It's absolutely one of the year's best."
1,Rotten,"It's ambitious, sharply observed and spectacularly well-acted like so much of Sayles' canon. But it's also overstuffed and underdeveloped."
0,Fresh,Redmayne's enviable acting range makes Newt Scamander a far more engaging and emotionally- accessible character than Harry Potter ever was. Heavens to Hogwarts!
1,Rotten,"Linklater's willingness to experiment ... is laudable. But I'm not sure he's reinventing animation here, or even adequately serving that older-than-children animation audience."
1,Rotten,"It's not good enough to like, but it's not bad enough to dislike either. It's simply an adequate two hours of mildly entertaining professionalism that scales the heights of so-soism."
0,Fresh,"We aren't accustomed to seeing older women partnered with younger men, which is, at least for its novelty, a more interesting and uncharted dynamic, and one elegantly captured in Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool."
0,Fresh,"It is not an easy thing to place us into the lives of people we've never had real-life contact with, but this is the stuff that fuels Granik's creativity, and Leave No Trace is a fresh reminder of her talent."
1,Rotten,It's that age-old question of many worthy movies: whether the mere documentation of an important event (à la Gandhi or Schindler's List) automatically makes it a great film?
1,Rotten,"While it's unnerving and grisly, it's never very scary, relying on jolts and effects rather than storytelling."
0,Fresh,"An emotional, irremediably human and essential work. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"Like far too many modern horror films, All the Boys Love Mandy Lane flaunts its knowledge of classic genre fundamentals but fails to do anything very clever or surprising with them."

0,Fresh,"Genuinely scary and suspenseful because it leaves room for imagination and doesn't rely on gore or use a ""found footage"" device."
0,Fresh,"It makes its points without too much breast-beating, caching its polemic within a tough-minded entertainment."
0,Fresh,What's disarming about this sequel is the psychological depth director Sam Raimi and his team have brought to the franchise.
1,Rotten,A clumsily melodramatic movie that tells us too much too soon and forces us to sit through endless morose vacuousness.
1,Rotten,The pettiness is strong with this one.
0,Fresh,"the kind of brilliant comedy that will have you gasping, laughing so hard you'll have tears in your eyes."
1,Rotten,Stuff blows up and glass shatters when Blade is in the room. He's like Shaft with worst theme music.
1,Rotten,"Neither nimble enough to reflect the times nor passionate enough to be inspiring, the election year comedy relies on broad-side-of-a-barn caricatures and out-of-the-mouths-of-babes platitudes."
1,Rotten,takes what should have been a mesmerizing slice of urban historical grit and grinds it into roughly two hours of standard issue cinema
1,Rotten,"MacGruber! Did they really make a movie out of that one-joke ""SNL"" character? MacGruber! Can a 90-second sketch become a funny feature film? MacGruber! Well, it's no Wayne's World but at least it's not It's Pat. MacGruber!"
1,Rotten,A step away from Springtime for Hitler -- a classic awful.
1,Rotten,They're saying Rent was of its moment. They're saying that moment has passed. So the point of making the movie is . . . ?
0,Fresh,"""Bad Words"" has a dark, nasty streak a mile wide, but there is something ever so slightly redemptive at its core, that makes it more than just an exercise in unpleasant behavior."
0,Fresh,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 may well disappoint fans who loved the first half’s dynamism, but in its way, the new movie has the subtlety of Tarantino’s Jackie Brown."
1,Rotten,It fails to provide the sorts of human inter-connections and deep revelations for which director Mitch Davis seems to be striving.
0,Fresh,"It simply aims to keep us on the proverbial seat edge, and it mostly succeeds, even if Gajdusek's twist-filled script has more turnovers than a closely fought football game."
0,Fresh,"Beatty and Annette Bening charge their roles with energy, and the supporting cast includes such talents as Harvey Keitel, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, and Elliott Gould in sturdy performances."
1,Rotten,"It's a strong idea that isn't executed as it should have been in order to produce a wholly engaging piece, and though clearly created with care, The Rainbow Experiment ends up less enthralling than its titular incident."
1,Rotten,An '80s coming-of-age comedy with more energy than ideas.
0,Fresh,"""I like your name,"" said David Bowie when he first met Mick Rock. ""It can't be real."" Well it was, and Rock would more than live up to it."
1,Rotten,"Not a very good movie, but it has some sincerely positive ideas, and those ideas almost make up for the fact that it's not a very good movie."
1,Rotten,"It's pointless to nitpick a film this ostentatiously loose and loutish, but in the film's execution much of that spirit just comes off as lazy and careless."
1,Rotten,At which exact point The Spirit hits rock bottom is a matter of debate.
1,Rotten,"The movie's story and meaning are not mysterious but deliberately impenetrable, faint gestures in all directions, absent of artistic integrity, intellectual rigor or emotional significance."
1,Rotten,"Sad nonsense, this. But not without cheesy fun factor."
0,Fresh,"Like the heroine at its center, Wonder Woman the movie rises with powerful grace above the noise. It's not perfect, but it's often good, sometimes great and exceptionally re-watchable."
0,Fresh,"Reichardt in no way pushes her material, instead giving the viewer the space to live in this space with the characters, observe them and listen to them, and then draw one's own conclusions about thematic import."
0,Fresh,Burt Lancaster is superb in his finest performance.
0,Fresh,"Like its subject, this unpretentious feel good movie aims for and hits a more generous definition of the term ""winner""."
0,Fresh,"A psychological thriller that emphasizes the psychology over the thrills. It's a smart, heart-twisting picture."
0,Fresh,This film is a reminder that the smallness of life can feel huge when we're in the middle of it.
0,Fresh,A satisfying and faithful capper to a series that was made by true-blue horror buffs as a love letter for true-blue horror buffs. Job well done.
0,Fresh,"""The Matrix"" is in its DNA, and like ""The Matrix,"" ""John Wick"" elevates action not by apologizing for it but embodying it, and embedding in its thrills meditations on the nature of existence."
1,Rotten,"An experimental film that's lost sight of what the experiment was supposed to be, a thematic treatise playing peek-a-boo with its themes."
0,Fresh,"It brings a light touch to modern romance, and the fact that commitment phobia, so long a male prerogative, is now being claimed by women."
1,Rotten,"While the efforts to bring Pokemon to life are successful, the human thespians sometimes struggle to keep up with their furry, feathered and scaly co-stars."

0,Fresh,"The four lead actresses are better than ever...costume designer Patricia Field, the 'fifth Beatle' as it were, has outdone herself."
1,Rotten,"Hammer does a fine job in his largely solo role, so it's a shame directing duo Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro choose to saddle him with several hallucinatory/real visitors during his ordeal."
1,Rotten,"It's a mild-mannered film, strange considering the ferocious nature of tennis itself, the sport that supposedly holds ""Break Point"" together."

1,Rotten,"If you're a WWF fan, or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I., you'll probably like Rollerball."
1,Rotten,"The first ""Independence Day'' was a lot of fun, with a great lines and cutting-edge special effects. It was much imitated, so the sequel plays like a faded, eighth-generation copy with a cast that's shooting blanks when it comes to humor."

0,Fresh,What is seductive about Appaloosa is its easygoing rhythm.
0,Fresh,"It's touching, funny and tragic and much like Tom Hanks as Gump or Michael J Fox as McFly, Zemeckis struck gold here with Carell - who can't do much wrong at the moment."
0,Fresh,"Buoyed by luck, comedy and state-of-the-art special effects, it has not only survived the journey intact, it's also washed down its decks, ready for a whole new cycle of movies to begin."
0,Fresh,A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.

0,Fresh,"Far from being a cautionary tale, Her highlights how technology itself can not only fulfill our emotional needs, but also clarify our relationships with the people it's meant to connect us with."
1,Rotten,A would-be sophisticated frolic so droopy and inane that the plot holes and dull performances almost obliterate the gorgeous visuals.
1,Rotten,"Stoned on cinema, Soderbergh retreads the paces of Stanislaw Lem and Andrei Tarkovsky ... appropriat[ing] certain settings and images to mostly failed effect."

0,Fresh,Its sincerity is admirable.
0,Fresh,Nolan is the star of this explosive mood piece that soars on the wings of its visuals and sound and makes it truly a visceral experience.
0,Fresh,"But despite its unabashed fondness for clichs and tired tropes, Shot Caller mostly succeeds in its aims because of Waugh's sober, matter-of-fact approach to the material."
0,Fresh,"Jawdropping and jawbreaking stunts performed by professional snowboarders open Lucy Walker's latest documentary, but it is the aftermath of accidents that form the powerfully disturbing core of the film."
0,Fresh,"Finding Dory doesn't quite reach the heights of Finding Nemo. But it's a lovely experience for those riding the Pacific Ocean currents for the first time, and a nostalgic one for those of us returning."

0,Fresh,"Not only is TS2 better than the first outing, it is better than most movies released this year."

1,Rotten,Has not a hint of the charm of [the 199 film] which Robin Williams starred in. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"The directorial instincts of Villeneuve lean toward the lurid, though he seems to think he's making a grand and brooding statement about the human condition. Prisoners is a compelling but unpleasant film, captive to its own schlocky hubris."
1,Rotten,"Southland is ridiculous in much the same way the Austin Powers movies are, but it's played straight."
0,Fresh,"Niccol smartly contrasts the bland, blond beauty of computer-colored Simone ... with the brunet vividness of Keener."
0,Fresh,The Boy and the Beast is an effervescent anime and one of the most exquisite feature-length animations of recent memory.
0,Fresh,Whiplash quick and twice as exciting.
0,Fresh,An intriguingly stripped-down sci-fi thriller about artificial intelligence that's fully attuned to its more blockbuster elements yet pleasingly cerebral at the same time.
0,Fresh,"Not all the puns go over, but the film is fun and, actually, slightly message-driven."
1,Rotten,"At its core Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers has an interesting narrative, although it refuses to recognize it."
0,Fresh,It is a fiercely watchable film.
0,Fresh,"For all its talk of death, The Farewell Party, featuring a terrific ensemble cast, is a story about life. Always honest, graceful and funny it explores with deep compassion its characters familial and romantic relationships."
0,Fresh,"In the face of this pretence of cool cynicism, the film's eventual nod to sentiment and pathos doesn't seem maudlin or ridiculous. Credit should go to Reynolds, who brings to bear the sincerity and vulnerability he's expressed before in his rom-com roles."
0,Fresh,To say that Arctic is a very intense survival thriller wouldn't be an understatement because this is a film that takes us along for a worrisome ride from start to finish.
1,Rotten,Of course we all know how it's going to end and the film's crushing predictability could be ignored if it raised more laughs -- but this is all over the place.
0,Fresh,Steve Carell and Keira Knightley make for one of the most unlikely and yet one of the most touching romantic couples of the year.
0,Fresh,Moverman gets away with a protagonist who it's impossible to root for by making sure we care about the fallout of his meltdown.
0,Fresh,"This is the best of the fatalistic dramas scripted by Prévert and directed by Carné, a doom-laden romance, heavier on atmosphere than tension, and made memorable by the performances."
1,Rotten,An incredibly slight comedy that earns points because it's clean and has a good message. It's just not terribly funny.
0,Fresh,"One of the pleasures of Rob the Mob, director Raymond De Felitta's serio-comic crime drama, is watching Pitt and Arianda as the rambunctious, lovestruck pair who can't believe the scam they've stumbled upon."
0,Fresh,Victoria & Abdul is Dench's show.
0,Fresh,An amused and affectionate look at the writer who formed a crucial link between the New Journalism of the 1960s and today's blogosphere.

0,Fresh,"Revealing fast food docu has some language, animal violence."
1,Rotten,"The question is, could someone turn these full-frontal-dudity snapshots into a satisfying, cohesive movie? Answer: no, but not for lack of trying."
0,Fresh,"This may not be the definitive movie about Ned Kelly, but it's a skillfully-made picture with plenty of thrilling drama."
0,Fresh,RV works up an ingratiating sweetness that partially compensates for its blunt predictability and meager laughs.
1,Rotten,"I've got to give credit to this new version for being entertaining in parts, even though it still can't justify its own existence."
0,Fresh,Shelton ... understands both genders and can write for them.
1,Rotten,Paris 36 is an indigestible hunk of gooey French cheese.
0,Fresh,"Moreover, Layton stylishly smashes true crime into the film obsessions that powered the man-child posse. Part The Thin Blue Line, part The Taking of Pelham 123, it's an all-American tale of self-destruction through delusion."
0,Fresh,"Two very entertaining hours -- something that Hollywood comedies these days fail to deliver to the audience, with or without references to certain bodily fluids."
1,Rotten,I thought this film was a mess.
1,Rotten,"...the film's performances, dialogue, and storyline all [suffer] from an unmistakable vibe of incompetence."
0,Fresh,"A movie about the late great director poses a question too great to ignore: how does one truly capture the idea of Hitchcock in a span of only 99 minutes? The answer is you can't, and here is a movie that, thankfully, knows that."
0,Fresh,"Nobody can orchestrate this robust silliness better than Steven Spielberg, who brings effortless visual panache to the proceedings, even when he can't entirely hide its mercenary nature."
1,Rotten,Violet Tendencies betrays both its camp roots and its grown-up goals.
0,Fresh,"One of the most violent films I've seen from a female cinematographer. But Anna Foerster adds lots of lovely, brilliantly-lit visual touches and handles the Die Hard-style action as well as any man."
0,Fresh,A damning indictment of the White House which concludes that 9/11 was less a failure of intelligence than a willful failure to act.

0,Fresh,"This is powerful stuff, and all the more so for its straightforwardness."
0,Fresh,"A funny, creative, fast-paced, and well-shot horror satire. They do exist."
1,Rotten,So sugary sweet and packed with magic-realistic miracles it plays like an Oprah Winfrey-produced miniseries on crack.
1,Rotten,The art-house version of a summer blockbuster: All style and no substance.
0,Fresh,Alex Gibney moves into an elite class of filmmakers with this timely tale of tormented whistleblowers.
0,Fresh,"Small and subdued, yet at the same time epic in scale. Shyamalan tells the story of superheroes, but in a contained and human fashion."
1,Rotten,"Formerly a fun, dumb, R-rated, Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, this is now a PG-13, CGI Cheese Whiz exercise in remaking a famous-title with a second-tier cast."
1,Rotten,"An informative, if largely deferent, biographical documentary that tritely explains the ascendancy of Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao."
1,Rotten,Potential is a terrible thing to waste.
1,Rotten,Fails to elicit any ounce of intrigue or passion in a cold fish of an espionage film that fails to deliver on both.
0,Fresh,"The story is told in sharp, abbreviated sequences gathering speed steadily toward their explosive climax, makes The Man Who Knew Too Much one of the neatest melodramas of the year."
0,Fresh,"Holland makes breakthrough, and rest of cast is excellent; film not so much. Hey, ho, let's kind of go?"
0,Fresh,"Bigelow brings Detroit home, showing how this historical scar on the American Dream deserves to be far more than an abhorrent footnote."
0,Fresh,It's hard to describe too much of this plot both because it's filled with surprises (some of the things that may strike you as ridiculous are in fact not what they seem to be) and partly because it's preposterously baroque.
1,Rotten,The fight choreography in Dracula Untold looks about as coherent as if you'd driven by the set at 40 mph and chucked the camera out the window.
0,Fresh,Achieves the perfect cartoonish look but makes some fine points about racism through its silliness.
0,Fresh,The film offers bitter food for thought at a time when the Middle East is going through yet another frantically incendiary period.
0,Fresh,"As exhilarating, captivating and enjoyable as a summer romance in an exotic city."
0,Fresh,"So if you're like me, and you can happily just spend a few hours sighing and squeeing about cute and snarky imaginary fuzzballs, then you won't hate this movie."
0,Fresh,"""Kong: Skull Island"" is big action film, with big ideas with a deep ensemble that becomes something more than big dumb fun."
0,Fresh,"Relaxed, affable look back at the golden age of Jewish resorts of New York's Catskill Mountains."
1,Rotten,"There's nothing wrong with asking viewers to fill in some holes. But ""Sound of My Voice"" leaves you dangling, reaching out for something that's just not there."
1,Rotten,Looks like a so-so TV movie that kept getting zeros put on its budget without the gags being added in equal measure.
0,Fresh,"Sharp, funny and stylish, but still, something doesn't quite fit..."
1,Rotten,"Although there are some fun jolts and gruesome shocks to be had, Friend Request struggles to find anything new to say, feeling instead like something you'd half-remembered from a decade ago."
0,Fresh,[Spring] probably represents the purest and most transcendent distillation of the Buddhist faith ever rendered on the screen.
0,Fresh,"Overall, Blood Fest is a blast. It has a plot that is astronomically unfeasible but it doesn't matter because you're having so much fun with the film. As a horror fan, it's a must see."
0,Fresh,"Hardcore, flawed and uneven, contains moments of pure revelation."
1,Rotten,"When you find yourself focused more on the fact that Mara's character never ditches her high heels, even when running around a forest, it's a bad sign."
0,Fresh,Gruesome but oddly riveting.
0,Fresh,"If t's a mostly agreeable rom-com you're after, one underpinned by a fresh soundtrack celebrating many of the greats in American music then The High Note might just be for you."
1,Rotten,"The film stymied my every attempt to like it until I was forced to conclude that despite the pine-fresh smell it emits by virtue of its release date, it's just not very good."
1,Rotten,"While the intentions are fun, the results don't measure up."
0,Fresh,Makes concessions to nothing and nobody - it is about as pure an expression of the writer/director's sensibilities as you could ask for.
1,Rotten,"[Midway] builds up a lot of tension about that battle, but delivers nothing new."
1,Rotten,Ben Stiller's almost perverse adaptation of James Thurber's famous short story takes the figure of an idle daydreamer and turns him into a virtual action hero.
0,Fresh,"For 100 minutes, I didn't think about anything else at all. And sometimes that small relief is the best thing a movie can give."
1,Rotten,"Prospect is visually and audibly dazzling, with compelling character development but crash lands into an over-stylised and simplistic storyline."
1,Rotten,"The animation looks unfinished, with a kind of lifeless mechanical sheen replacing actual textures."
0,Fresh,"Thankfully, Torque knows what it wants to be ... and flashes a jocular self-awareness about its genre affiliation."
0,Fresh,Wonderful sports comedy full of inspiring moments and exciting basketball action.
0,Fresh,The Death of Stalin isn't about Stalin or what happened in 1953. Instead it's about the dark side of power and those who execute it. [Full Review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Murphy is fresh, as usual, but Metro is not."
1,Rotten,"Tonally incoherent, vacuous and structurally a bleedin' mess."
1,Rotten,"The writing here is rarely funny, and often trite and predictable."
1,Rotten,"By Americanising the hero and grotesquely distorting the plot, they can only alienate the fan-base and confuse the newcomer."
0,Fresh,"This is Bond like you've never seen him and a dynamite Daniel Craig, never better in the role, nails Bond's ferocity and feeling. Skyfall is smashing, just smashing."
0,Fresh,Not since the Jehovah's Witnesses came by has opening the front door seemed so terrifying.
0,Fresh,A warm summer treat amid the gunfights and explosions that reminds us how beautiful a child's innocence can be.
1,Rotten,"Sweet, charming...and not particularly funny for even a moment."
1,Rotten,"Documentary of a spate of child kidnappings/killings in Staten Island, New York, in the 1970s, tied thematically to the titular Hudson Valley boogeyman myth."
1,Rotten,"As Balthazar, Cage doesn't disappoint. He's just manic enough to keep the character from becoming too predictable. More's the pity, then, that a pro like him has to cede so much screen time to his character's young protege."
0,Fresh,Director Kiyoshi Kurosawa has an expert eye for making the benign and banal feel ethereal and incorporeal in his ghost story...
1,Rotten,"After enduring this flagrant emotional blitz, you may feel like throwing a penalty flag."
1,Rotten,"Even if you factor out Davidson's limitations as a performer, the film suffers from the usual flaws that have become all too familiar in Apatow's work -- it goes on way too long."
0,Fresh,It's a double miracle: a stupendous comedy and a great argument for mass sterilization.
0,Fresh,"With the release of Finding Nemo, the creative team at Pixar has redefined what is known as being 'on a role.'"
0,Fresh,"The film will linger in the mind long after its devastating conclusion. You leave the cinema breathless and disquieted but also with a sense of having had something important revealed to you. In a very strong field, this is the year's best film so far."
1,Rotten,Running With Scissors fails to make the cut.
0,Fresh,"A haunting, visceral trip through the mind of a man on the edge of his own sanity."

0,Fresh,The fact that it manages to blend dark comedy and suspense while also being accompanied by unforgettable crisp visuals makes it stand out from most films released within years.
0,Fresh,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse truly embraces what it's like to read a comic book, by making its characters and the tone of the film feel like part of a comic book itself."
0,Fresh,The perfect Mother's Day movie?
0,Fresh,"While Tom remains a lot of fun, he's just not the irreverent Young Turk he seemed three decades ago."
0,Fresh,"It's a totally wild ride, full of gun battles, explosions and fisticuffs, liberally sprinkled with the tongue-in-cheek comedy we've come to expect from Mr. Willis."
1,Rotten,"The costumes and wigs are splendid, and the songs are still up to snuff. But this homage to a showman is more famine than feast."
0,Fresh,"Stallone doesn't pander to audiences with unearned sentiment. He believes in his story, in the inspirational element that has sent thousands of folks running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art over 30 years."
1,Rotten,"White Noise has its merits, including persuasive acting by Michael Keaton -- too bad this unchilling chiller won't give his sagging career much of a lift."
1,Rotten,"Ben Hernandez Bray's ""El Chicano"" seldom amounts to anything more than a crude prototype for the kind of Latinx-driven superhero movies that Marvel and DC should already be making by now."
0,Fresh,"One wallow does not make a summer, but the combined forces of Ludwig's music and a chorus of celebrity erudition should help to take your mind off the April cacophony elsewhere."
0,Fresh,"The skating routines are a lot of fun to watch, filled with great choreography and backed by great tunes."
0,Fresh,"Solidly good and very enjoyable. But the film has flickers of greatness, most of which are when the film takes on the form of buddy comedy with Larson paired with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. Jackson and Brie have a hilarious rapport."
0,Fresh,"A jangly, noisy, compulsively restless thriller on a par with the Bourne movies, shot through with political critique."
0,Fresh,"This absurd romantic comedy, about a couple of thirtysomething rakes who sneak into bridal parties to meet women, is often laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to the considerable charms of its four leads and a few gleefully tasteless sex jokes."
1,Rotten,"Impeccably filmed, sexually charged, but ultimately lacking in substance, not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act."
0,Fresh,"The lavish set design and warm love story, the earnest performances and the movie's unflinching, optimistic tone could make Brooklyn one of the finest films of the year."
0,Fresh,"Don't Breathe is physically punishing in its relentless ratcheting of tension, an absolute masterclass in horror film making with virtually not an ounce of fat on it."
0,Fresh,"Ballet and Robert Altman should be the most mismatched of dance partners. But, amazingly, the two are perfectly in step."
0,Fresh,"Intense and provocative, it's a gripping and emotionally draining drama that is, by necessity, difficult to watch at times."
0,Fresh,The film doesn't just have its cake and eat it. It makes you want to upgrade that cake to a chic Ladure macaroon.
0,Fresh,The perfect high old time for audiences in the mood to be tossed into the spin cycle for a pulse-pounding thrill ride.
0,Fresh,Superbly acted by all involved.
0,Fresh,"My favorite of the three most recent Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith mixes all of the best elements from its predecessors."
0,Fresh,"The direction by Kathryn Bigelow, who won Oscars for Best Film and Best Director in her previous film ""The Hurt Locker,"" is fierce and focused..."
0,Fresh,It's such a potent and courageous wreck of a movie that it's worth more than most 'successes.'
0,Fresh,"'22 July' requires more hot-blooded outrage and consternation. If I wanted a dispassionate retelling of this heinous crime, I would have read newspaper articles."
0,Fresh,"A ""smart"" thriller - the title itself is intended to convey that this is an ideal summer popcorn movie - but it's a little too tricky for its own good."
0,Fresh,"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil can best be described as Disney's Game of Thrones. It's the infamous ""Red Wedding"", but with fairy tale characters. Angelina Jolie returns to theaters in a much darker and violent sequel."
0,Fresh,"Yes, there are a few too many gags about his advancing years, but [Arnie's] return to being the Terminator is a welcome sight."
0,Fresh,"Perhaps a bit too leisurely paced, the film unspools as an engaging, if not enthralling, look at the realities of racism and cultural identity."
1,Rotten,"Swimfan, like Fatal Attraction, eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub."
0,Fresh,"Adopts the classic epic approach of David Lean, but its heart and soul have far more in common with anti-war, anti-establishment films such as Richard Lester's How I Won the War and Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade."
1,Rotten,"Too banal to be offensive, it's certainly one to miss"
1,Rotten,"If you didn't know Li was a world-class WuShu champion, you'd never guess it - all his action scenes are edited within an inch of their lives."

0,Fresh,"The movie generates a decent amount of good will, and after a couple of hours under the hood, Howard gets it running."
0,Fresh,Sean Baker's beautiful heartbreaker scratches just below the cheery lilac and bubblegum pink to expose the layers of privation festering in this sunshiny state.
0,Fresh,"A touching, tender love story and a respectful, fully cinematic biography of an underappreciated talent, whose scandalous tastes eclipsed her star power."
1,Rotten,"El universo literario de Gabriel García Márquez como sólo Hollywood podía hacerlo: vistoso, prolijo, insípido, superficial. Ni siquiera Javier Bardem logra rescatarlo del olvido."
0,Fresh,"It's a fascinating and somewhat obscure and laudatory slice of Marshall's professional life, and that's all, and that's fine. But there's room for another Marshall picture."
0,Fresh,"The Edge of Seventeen promises to become, for many, a new favorite film."
0,Fresh,The set pieces make this well worth watching while director Goro Miyazaki shows he's truly his father's son.

0,Fresh,A stately and elegant horror film.
1,Rotten,"Vox Lux won't help Portman's career much, but a misstep for the right reasons is not something to deride."

0,Fresh,"Ajami is not pretty and it's not heart-warming - the threat of violence is always looming - but it is emotionally gripping, and it puts you right in its midst."
0,Fresh,"Shane Black excels at writing witty, self-referential, pop-infused banter, and there is no actor working today who is better suited to delivering it than Robert Downey Jr."

1,Rotten,"A story about an abusive boyfriend's attempts at wrestling a girl from her friends, family and one prospective healthy love interest, and her burgeoning realisation that her man is a monster."
1,Rotten,"Tomcats seems obsessed not by offering viewers a good time, but by trying to out-gross its predecessors."
0,Fresh,"As entertainment, it gives good value: it's light, quick and diverting. Morgan Freeman, predictably, gives it heart, gravitas and the appearance of wisdom; but it's Carrey who keeps all the balls in the air with refined mania."
0,Fresh,A film of our times that captures the spirit of a generation that isn't prepared to wait their turn or pay their dues and instead will make the opportunities for themselves or tear it away from the less ambitious.
0,Fresh,"Luc Besson's original cut feels more like a journey than just a joy-buzzer jolt of action, and the deeper, braver, darker story he set out to tell - a fractured and fractious fairy tale. When people rave about ""The Professional,"" they mean ""Lon."""
0,Fresh,"Cronenberg's direction is astonishingly good, particularly during two contrasting sex scenes that demonstrate the irreversible power shift in the relationship between Tom and Edie."
0,Fresh,"The first movie based on Michael Bond's Paddington Bear books was an absolute delight, and defying the usual laws of sequelitis, the second is equally charming."
1,Rotten,"The Damned United is a populist - at times, almost cartoonish - attempt to make comprehensible the story behind Brian Clough's ill-fated 44-day tenure at Leeds United."
1,Rotten,... ultimately the material just doesn't work.
0,Fresh,"Though the story is drawn in broad strokes and overloaded with melodrama, director Mat Whitecross' exuberant feature understands the communal joy and personal necessity of rock 'n' roll."
1,Rotten,"It doesn't matter that the storyline of Ridley Scott's A Good Year is different from that of its inspiration - Peter Mayle's book, A Year in Provence. But it does matter that the tone is flippant and that we don't fall in love with the central character"

1,Rotten,"Viewers who make it to the third act of The King of Staten Island will find that this Pete Davidson starrer actually has a heart beneath its smarmy exterior. Getting to that point, though, is a slog."
1,Rotten,"You won't like anyone you meet in this trifle, nor care whether anyone gets any bang for his buck."
1,Rotten,"Marcus makes little effort to illuminate Breitbart's character or motivation, so this high-pitched portrait ends up a little flat."

1,Rotten,"Will Smith, Fourth of July, superhero. It all seems to add up to a great combination. But they only made half a film."
0,Fresh,"For all its biting political satire, and cogent military analysis, War Machine is an antiwar movie that is profoundly pro-warrior."
0,Fresh,Angelina Jolie as Maleficent is a joy to watch.
0,Fresh,t's fascinating to watch some of the actors who have had real-life addictions (like Dick did himself) dive into their own convoluted rationalizations and philosophies during the film. It's almost like watching one of their 12-step meeting
0,Fresh,"Superlative performances are the reason to watch this engrossing, occasionally self-indulgent film that explores the female psyche and responses to age, self-image and changing times within the acting world"
1,Rotten,"If the Now You See Me movies were even half as clever as they thought they were, they would be tremendous."
0,Fresh,"For those that go into it only for the dancing, they will get more than enough to fill their appetites."

0,Fresh,"Kazan, who plays the seductive figment of Paul Dano's imagination, has written an endearing screenplay in whose daring concept the lines of fiction and real life are blurred"
1,Rotten,"The Hollars deals in weighty personal tragedies, and yet neither the treacly, offbeat humor nor the moments of more straightforward pathos tend to work for any real length of time."
1,Rotten,Charming and highly original but a little of it goes a long way.
0,Fresh,"It sounds like a downer but A Single Man is exciting, emotionally alive filmmaking, a potent cocktail of style and substance. And Firth thoroughly deserves the Oscar."
1,Rotten,A lowfat feast of stereotypes.

1,Rotten,"I wanted to love it, tried to love it and then went down in flames."
1,Rotten,Not likely to have the undying appeal of a film like Shrek or Toy Story.
1,Rotten,It is admirably unsparing and gloomily atmospheric. And I looked at my watch a bunch of times.

1,Rotten,"Well, everybody knows November means just one thing to most folks: a big, fat turkey. And guess who's the stuffing?"
1,Rotten,Gilliam's film is trapped somewhere between fable and comedy. It's as if he is so entranced by his own visual inventiveness that he completely loses sight of his storytelling.
1,Rotten,"I think GoodFellas leaves this for dead, absolutely for dead."
1,Rotten,"This ghost story starts off well, with an interesting setup and characters, but then it starts relying too much on cheap jump-scares and eventually lets the mystery slip away and fall apart."
0,Fresh,More entertaining than Wall Street 2 while saying infinitely more about the iniquities of those that claim to work for us.

0,Fresh,"Enthusiasm carries the day in this paint-by-numbers period tale, which is just charming enough to coast on its own clichs."
1,Rotten,"The film is as lightweight as the ganja-puffing is plentiful, little more than a vanity project that allows its subject to wax philosophical on his past triumphs, tragedies, and spiritual development ..."
0,Fresh,Daybreakers is a perfect panacea to audiences averse to the tweeny romanticisation of the undead by Twilight and its ilk.
1,Rotten,"An under-achieving film about how much women can achieve, featuring actors of such potential, seems more than a bit cynical even by Hollywood standards."
1,Rotten,A prime contender for 2011's biggest cinematic embarrassment.

1,Rotten,"A fluffy teen comedy, Accepted gets annoying fast."
0,Fresh,"A film that nearly screams its desire to please in every frame; in its very design, it demands your attention, has you tapping your toes before the opening montage is through, and frames its soft messages of tolerance so broadly that only Hitler could be"
1,Rotten,Self-important piffle ...
1,Rotten,Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters ends with the suggestion that there is more to come. That seems overly optimistic.

1,Rotten,"It's nice to see this story onscreen, but frustrating to watch it try to have it both ways on virtually every plot point."
1,Rotten,"The homogenized quality of much network fare is especially frustrating here, in what should have been, if not a heartfelt study of youthful angst, at least a horribly good time."

1,Rotten,"The film's lack of inspiration at every level - technical, narrative and comedic - is so crushing that, save for pre-adolescents, most will consider this a top contender for worst of breed."

0,Fresh,One of the year's more devastating film experiences.
0,Fresh,"As a fan of the series, I wished for a stronger sendoff with a lot less comic book splatter."
1,Rotten,"Timeline is a dreadful movie. It's a hybrid of science fiction and medieval war film that was made for $80 million, but it looks cheap and it feels small."
0,Fresh,"It is a good, honest performance and, for all that the movie itself is brittle, self-conscious and perhaps a little absurd at times, there is a vehement, urgent idealism."
0,Fresh,It has the ability to break your heart.
1,Rotten,Stillborn.
1,Rotten,The Last Samurai is either a deeply subversive film or a terriby misguided one.
0,Fresh,"Williams, it seems, can do almost anything. She is a protean actor of amazing range..a shimmering presence who is both tougher and more vulnerable than you would expect."
0,Fresh,"In its honest depiction of the horror of racism, Rosewood should be seen. That very honesty is also the reason no one will want to see it."
0,Fresh,A truly compelling portrait of a washed-up child star; even more compelling is the story of the peripheral people who suffer because of the misery of a washed-up child star.
1,Rotten,"Beineix's film is awash with the humour and cool of his debut, Diva, but lacks the cohesion to sustain its weighty ambition."
1,Rotten,Almost every set or action or line of dialogue feels like the substandard equivalent of something you've seen or heard being done better elsewhere.
0,Fresh,"Kubrick's showcase of abilities, both with the camera and his characters, are incomparably haunting."

1,Rotten,"This is a coward's picture that is about to spend a few months getting patted on the back, as if anybody involved risked anything to bring it to life."
0,Fresh,The film suffers because the story of Sarah and her bravery and loss back in 1942 are much more compelling and hard-hitting than the comparatively twee modern 'drama'.
0,Fresh,[Portman] plays the girl with gumption exceedingly well.

0,Fresh,"All of these moments are presented completely without cynicism or judgment, and their joyousness is infectious."
0,Fresh,"One could accuse Baumbach of repeating himself, but when the writing and directing is this sharp, who cares? The neuroses and contradictions here become relatable to anyone who's had a difficult time listening to or being heard by their family."
1,Rotten,[Brian DePalma] apparently considers ''money isn't everything'' an original and profound message.

0,Fresh,"Somehow now the energy seems infectiously giddier, the songs zingier, the camp higher."
0,Fresh,"Retaliation benefits from Bloom's mature, internalized performance [and] commanding physical and emotional presence... He deftly conveys the shame and confusion Malky feels; it is as heavy as the cross he carries from the church he is demolishing."
1,Rotten,"Note to fledgling directors: when making a movie, you don't have to do everything yourself. In fact, you probably shouldn't."
1,Rotten,Thank goodness for NPH. His appearance wakes up the film and makes things fun for a while.
1,Rotten,"Like other Irvin films, this noir saga (more of an urban Western) is burdened with a philosophical layer that's incongruous with the basic tale, though acting by Keitel, Dorff, and others is good."
0,Fresh,"John Krasinski, directing only his third feature from a script by Bryan Woods, Scott Beck and Krasinski, delivers a solid genre picture with a remarkably high concept"
1,Rotten,"Quickly paced and based on a novel, and creepy, idea, the film fritters away its potential by delivering only a modicum of horror and compounding that disappointment with some creaky performances."
0,Fresh,"The performances of Hanks, Gary Sinise, Mykleti Williamson and Robin Wright are worthy. What's missing, though, is a philosophical context in which to gauge what we're watching."
0,Fresh,"[Michael Moore] made his point by making a terrifically enjoyable, provocative film. Beyond that, he couldn't care less what anyone else thinks."
1,Rotten,The film production elements are iffy at best: The lighting is too bright. The costumes don't seem real. Skeeter's obtrusive wig looks like a mop. The musical score is not an asset.
0,Fresh,"After all the hype, it's impossible not to expect steam from this adaptation of E.L. James' mommy-porn bestseller"
0,Fresh,"Willis is a worthy replacement for Bronson, and it can be safely said: This new movie is way better than all the ""Death Wish"" sequels that Bronson kept churning out, the last when he was 72."

0,Fresh,"Jolie has chosen a complex subject for her feature debut as a writer and director, and although not perfect, it's not for lack of trying."
1,Rotten,"A clumsy cousin of Jordan Peele's Get Out, an allegory of racism in a horror film about entrapment that goes wide of the mark. The schematic writing, flat characterizations and level of brutality feel carelessly offensive."
0,Fresh,The film is one of the year's best.
1,Rotten,This is what happens when you combine THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS with SHREK. It should have been called DRECK!
1,Rotten,"[The Farrelly Brothers'] squeamish, childish fascination with bodily ickiness, when crossed with the iffy sexual politics of the original, yields a comic vision remarkable for its hysterical misogyny."
0,Fresh,A rare example of a sequel that is labor of love -- not one that worships at the altar of the Almighty Dollar.
0,Fresh,"If Aronofsky set out to make Trainspotting look like Teletubbies, he succeeded. Recommended only for those with extremely strong stomachs."

1,Rotten,"The jokes are uneven, the caricatures often overly broad, and the plot almost nonexistent."
0,Fresh,"Embattled and infuriating, Israel's submission for the Foreign Language Academy Award epitomizes the concept of male entitlement."

1,Rotten,David makes little sense as a character.
1,Rotten,"The book, with its themes of paranoia and totalitarianism, was acclaimed as a masterpiece. But the film, which also stars Robert Pattinson and was adapted by Coetzee himself, doesn't quite work."

0,Fresh,A beautifully crafted coming-of-age drama that also doubles as a 'Bedouin Western'.
1,Rotten,"Problematic is Rios' central performance... or non-performance. Her Magdalena is too phlegmatic to jibe with the tough, strong-willed individual the yarn calls for."
0,Fresh,It's a ride worth taking.
0,Fresh,"When Reeves, who seems to be challenging Cruise in the 'what, me 50?' do-my-own-stunts department, gets back in gear, he's like a ghost warrior, twirling, rolling, spinning, stabbing, firing on all cylinders so quickly he's gone before the bodies drop."
1,Rotten,[Julien Temple's] insider's point of view both helps and hurts the film.
0,Fresh,"Shot in HD and wholly embracing the technology, Piano Tuner makes bold leaps into visual domains previously untrodden by filmmakers, even the Quays, but incorporates plenty of their animation and their trademark density of decor. Absolutely entrancing!!!"

0,Fresh,"Ai's message is clear; the refugee crisis may take the form of faceless millions, but each pixel in that image of misery is a human being. It's a lesson worth remembering, and reflecting on."
1,Rotten,Much too tired and mean-spirited to be funny.
1,Rotten,"Although I laughed several times at the cast's low-key humour, this isn't exactly new or daring material when films are desperately in need of fresh voices."
0,Fresh,"[G]ets off to a bit of an uneven start, but finds its footing eventually... not the best of the series, and not the best of the new films, but it's still a worthwhile entry in the continuing saga..."

1,Rotten,Hoechlin is super dishy but he and Daddario have no chemistry together. Most of the time it is awkward and uncomfortable which is not what you want in this kind of escapist romcom.
0,Fresh,"Powered by Downey's charisma and state-of-the-art visuals, actor-director Favreau's vibrant franchise-starter makes RoboCop look like Dixon of Dock Green."
1,Rotten,"TV would be a better fit for these characters, one that doesn't raise the high expectations of a theatrical feature."
1,Rotten,Extremely sentimental and old-fashioned family entertainment that offers some gratifying diversion to non-discriminating viewers.
1,Rotten,This overwrought chase/final-countdown movie is as banal as the genre comes. It's not a well-made action film; it's just expensively made.
1,Rotten,"Polished and atmospheric, but utterly vacuous."
1,Rotten,"While the filmmakers obviously know their fan base/target audience and deliver the goods to them in spades, there's little here to recommend."
1,Rotten,"Amenta does neither the subject nor Atria justice with this acceptable, uninspired dramatization."
0,Fresh,It teaches a lesson we are always in danger of forgetting: that the greatest service we can do our country is to be true to our conscience.
1,Rotten,"While the 3D beasts are undeniably impressive, their human counterparts remain resolutely two-dimensional thanks to a script that mistakes tone-deaf jumps and starts for emotional arcs."
1,Rotten,"As a supposed summer blockbuster, this is a very eccentric film: The Cable Guy mocks its star as a pathetic jerk and comes close to telling its audience that we are, too."
0,Fresh,The concision with which Nashville approaches each subject is amazing. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Reluctant rebel moms in love. With much meaty food for thought, even if a bit philosophically tough and raw to chew on when at its most visually lyrical. And likely as much into shaking up narrative conventions, as subverting gender perspectives."

1,Rotten,A chance for Bale to show off his new lean look for what the filmmaker mistakenly thinks is art.
0,Fresh,"Mr. Anderson and Mr. Wilson are gifted artists, and I look forward to seeing them produce something that strives for more than just sustaining their own hype."
0,Fresh,"As the soundtrack moans in sympathy while the deep crimson colours dazzle in delirium, the entire movie comes desperately close to approximating the pell-mell emotional turmoil of sex itself. Not porn, sex."
1,Rotten,"Burstein either isn't aware of or has made a conscious decision to ignore the very ""non-fiction"" filmmaking that her subjects and their peers are likely most exposed to."

0,Fresh,"As a director, Larson comprehends the right about of comedy and never lets this story get so ridiculous it can't pull back into the realm of reason."
0,Fresh,"Morris was working in a dangerous middle ground between the traditional documentary and the fictional feature film, and his merging of various techniques paid off in a film of singular uniqueness in both its aesthetic approach and its real-world impact."
0,Fresh,The best of all 80s teen movies.
0,Fresh,The film lives and breathes through Clarkson. It's a stunning performance; Clarkson conveys as much in a look as many actresses struggle to reveal with overt histrionics.
0,Fresh,"Anyone who has ever been involved in amateur theater, or for that matter who has been involved with anyone involved in amateur theater, will applaud 'Hamlet 2.'"
0,Fresh,"The plot twists are easily guessed, and the film goes on for one predicament too long, but there are some good laughs."
1,Rotten,Ultimately too bland and safe.
1,Rotten,"The material seems too dark and violent for the target demographic, who could have difficulty finding a rooting interest in characters that possess more degrees of villainy than heroism."
0,Fresh,"The characters' behaviour rings true, the tension is strong and the oily darkness of it all looks good. Within his vaguely realistic constraints, however, Shults doesn't find a way to nudge the story to a satisfying ending."
0,Fresh,"In a world filled with distrust, 'Bridge of Spies' portrays the virtue of principle in a masterful film from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks."
1,Rotten,"You would think after all these decades of making these kinds of movies Disney would do a better job with this, but it really is terrible."

0,Fresh,"The boys are bright and funny, and when they do go out together - shades on, long hair flowing down rail-thin bodies - they look like a somewhat awkward but cool rock band you'd like to get to know. Moselle's documentary is the next best thing."
0,Fresh,"Alpha Dog operates without outrage -- not because the behavior of the people in the movie isn't horrifying but because the movie knows it is much too late to save those bouncing, happy kids we glimpsed in the opening seconds."
0,Fresh,"Sleek, stylish but superficial. Easy on the eye, even easier on the brain, it doesn't last long in the memory."
0,Fresh,A few good moments in this typically undercooked Brooks opus.

1,Rotten,"A big, gaudy, gimmicky comedy which continually promises more than it delivers by way of wit and/or bellylaffs."
0,Fresh,"There's something touching about the yearning for ordinary life and decency that, to judge by its ubiquity in films for the nominally innocent, plagues those who live and work in the realms of the unreal."
0,Fresh,"An eccentric, rather choppy, but highly watchable movie, and Orson Welles is quite alive in it. You can feel the intensity of his DNA in its sinister atmosphere of garish noir depravity."

0,Fresh,He always holds a card you don't see.
1,Rotten,Thoroughly inept in just about every aspect.
0,Fresh,"Though the subject matter inevitably seems a little sexed-up and contrived compared to recent docs like How to Survive a Plague, director Jean-Marc Valle rarely wastes an ounce of Matthew McConaughey's gusto."
1,Rotten,"If you're still determined to see a New York-based film about the romantic powers of the heavens this season, go rent Moonstruck. The writing is better, the story is better and it's only funny when it means to be."
0,Fresh,"The film gives a charming, funny, and many times engrossing account of Pekar which will surely please fans and garner some new ones and I liked it a lot."
0,Fresh,Many of the young actors are also quite good in a large ensemble that doesn't become the jumbled mess it could have.

1,Rotten,"Midler plays an extrovert with heart and brains, but the twists and turnarounds in this mother-and-child reunion arrive right on schedule; in the end, she's less a mother than a show-biz fairy godmother."

1,Rotten,"Something's missing. Although the movie is tense, it's not the white-knuckle experience you might expect, with the most suspenseful scenes coming across as manufactured."
1,Rotten,"The result, in both book and movie, is a Ship without buoyancy and with an alarming tendency to wallow in heavy seas."
0,Fresh,"It's just that the movie is so gosh-darned, I don't know, cuddly -- in a perverse, John Waters kind of way -- that it's hard not to like."
1,Rotten,"It would be fitting with Seidl's apparent project if Paradise (Love) was, in some sense, a documentary of its own making. But that doesn't make its facile ironies about still-pervasive, post-colonial exploitation and dehumanization any more enlightening"
0,Fresh,"Imagine a blend of The Muppet Movie, Mel Brooks, and Where's Waldo? and you're halfway to the carnival ride viewing experience Anderson delivers with this gem."

0,Fresh,A marvellous follow-up to 2004's Sideways - well worth the wait.
0,Fresh,"The film is remarkable for its depth. It's not drilling in a message about the hopelessness of poverty, nor is it stylising the lifestyle of those living on council estates."
1,Rotten,"Where many a movie falls into a vat of cheese is when it tries to show us ""the other side."" The angels' barracks turn out to look like the loft of an industrial-sized stable."

1,Rotten,"Exuberant, ambitious biopic that's engaging and entertaining yet strangely superficial. The razzle-dazzle fizzles out."
1,Rotten,"People are pumped with more bullets than those at the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan""; since they don't bleed, the MPAA considers this ""family-friendly,"" hilariously calling it ""frenetic gunplay."""

1,Rotten,"When all else fails, get the pensioners to swear."
0,Fresh,"Disturbing the Peace is a decent film that does its job as a bank heist film, the two leads do good work with Pierce being the standout, the rest of the cast is good, the film has a few issues here and there."

1,Rotten,Tyler Perry's latest soul operetta lives up to the mischief promised by its title. But that isn't nearly enough of the time.
0,Fresh,"The Disney animators have once again created a perfect dreamy, fantasy-like atmosphere that makes the mythical city of Agrabah and its residents seem warm and inviting."
1,Rotten,It's a bit too heady for its own good. And it doesn't help that the film is aloof and cold; it isn't exactly what you'd call enthralling.
0,Fresh,"This intelligently scripted and imposingly played costume noir revisits the conventions of Victorian melodrama to comment on modern attitudes to oppression, prejudice and morality."

0,Fresh,"From start to finish in ""Boy Erased,"" Hedges' performance is indelible."
1,Rotten,"Portman's performance in Hawley's debut film is its strongest aspect, but that isn't enough. The story feels jumbled, the supporting cast is underused and the film's visuals are more distracting than anything."
0,Fresh,"The standard action plot demotes District 9 from a potential game-changer to simply a very good film. And considering the painful summer movie season we've endured thus far, you can't ask for much more than that."

1,Rotten,"Despite a pair of spectacular characterizations by Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr., the film version of Dennis Potter's BBC miniseries plays a little offkey."
1,Rotten,Freaky Friday is blandness personified.
0,Fresh,"... magnificent on a purely sensual level ... The new version is shorter by about ten minutes and is divided by chapter headings, which make the film slightly less confusing."
0,Fresh,"He's amazingly frank about some of the people he doesn't like, and he breaks down when he talks about his friends and the people he loved. A surprisingly fine documentary."
0,Fresh,"It's hard to say whether it will linger in your memory very long, but it will keep you glued to your seat. Sorry Godzilla, but Kong has the edge for now."
1,Rotten,"By my count, the film manages at least five ties to wrench the audience from one false sense of certainty to another, but by number three, you just don't care anymore. In this case, familiarity just breeds tedium."
0,Fresh,"Lovely performances all round create small-town competitiveness, frustrations and aspirations."
0,Fresh,The final act is a delirious sugar rush of city-smashing spectacle. It's generic but 'Uprising' kicks the metal ass of any of the 'Transformers' films.
0,Fresh,"It has pace and variety and, best of all, it consistently has the courage of its imaginative and daring screenplay."
0,Fresh,This enjoyable comedic romp features all the elements that Bollywood is famous for.
0,Fresh,A magnificent movie.....you'll never forget it...Anthony Edwards is amazing
1,Rotten,It is getting very tiresome to see North American film productions insist that the only bad guys exist abroad. Al Capone was born in Brooklyn! [Full Review in Spanish]

0,Fresh,"As great as you've heard, and probably even greater."
0,Fresh,"The restoration eliminates nearly all the distracting cracks and splices and stabilizes images that were previously jittery, allowing us to admire them in all their complex glory."
1,Rotten,"However self-aware Spring Breakers' sleaze is, there's something creepy about it as a male perspective on young women."
1,Rotten,"Yet another unnecessary remake, this suitably scary haunted-house tale is likely to be loved only by those who never saw the original."
0,Fresh,"Delivers thrills, laughs and emotion in equal measure, thanks to a witty script, superb performances, thrilling action sequences and assured direction from Alan Taylor that gets the tone exactly right."
0,Fresh,"It comes within an inch of a really snappy disquisition (to use Morf's word) on the painting marketplace, but to avoid disappointment it's better approached as a gory romp."
0,Fresh,A delightful fable about the enduring value of literature.
1,Rotten,"You would think that in the current climate of constant comic book content, this movie would be even more successful than the ones that came before. Instead, it is far less so, a blaring, boring slog that should have been better."
0,Fresh,"It's a lot to tackle, but naturally, Spielberg has it all well in hand and he doesn't limit his spectacular casting to Streep and Hanks."
1,Rotten,"it's really nothing more than Charlie's Angels 2 all over again... with Clive Owen and a fetish prostitute instead of three young, hot chicks."
0,Fresh,The movie is brimming with life. The story is moving to the point where it's hard not to shed a tear.
1,Rotten,"The turgid, unnecessary and deeply stupid complexity of 'Smiley' will leave audiences frowning."
1,Rotten,There are about three good laughs in Starsky & Hutch.
1,Rotten,"Woodley remains grimly committed, and Naomi Watts turns in a serious performance as our new, slightly more complicated villain, but the rest of the characters barely exist."
0,Fresh,"It's a demonstration of a parent's most innate instinct: to protect their child, while also intimating that love and understanding is the ultimate protection."
0,Fresh,"It might be a bit too quiet and slow for some, and it has no real ""point"". For what it's worth it's pretty dope to see a film that has two men as friends, having conversations and enjoying one another's company"
0,Fresh,"We leave it deeply unsettled, as if we've time traveled back into our ancestors' worst nightmares."
1,Rotten,"""Eragon"" is based on a book by a 19-year-old with a script that seems to have been written by a 12-year-old."
0,Fresh,"This divorcee with a passion for belting out classic pop tunes and dancing is the star of her own life story, however modest its conflicts and ambitions are."
0,Fresh,"Award-worthy performances from John Hawkes, Helen Hunt and William H. Macy."
1,Rotten,Sunset Song is an overly studied tale of female perseverance set in rural Scotland that lacks the dimension of Davies' previous work.
0,Fresh,A perfectly cast comedy of manners that couches complex emotional questions in joyous farce and continues Gerwig's reign as the undisputed Queen Of Quirk.
1,Rotten,"At my screening, two guys sitting a few rows down from me smoked what appeared to be marijuana throughout the movie. I'm not condoning drug use, but they probably had the right idea."
0,Fresh,"The film attempts to honor both MacLaine/Harriet's obvious faults and blind spots as well as her bold second-wave feminism, and Pellington largely succeeds."
0,Fresh,"An exhilarating documentary that details the chaos, glamour and greed of the drug industry in Miami during the 1970s and '80s."
1,Rotten,"What could have been a bawdy feature about the repression of not only female sexuality, but also women's rights, is at times as tightly wound and restricted as the era it pretends to portray."
0,Fresh,"Of all the players, Uma Thurman channels the Bride to deliver a Medusa the children won't easily forget when it comes to bedtime."
0,Fresh,"Really, really funny!"
1,Rotten,"There are a few inspired scenes strung together by miles of filler on this road trip, and a pretty bull---- resolution ending."
0,Fresh,"Instead of portraying addiction as yet another bleak-as-night, Leaving Las Vegas, one-note affliction, Zemeckis and Denzel give us an addict that is as charming as he is belligerent."
1,Rotten,"A sleazy, uninspired, pathetically unfunny sex farce."
0,Fresh,"Packed with raw energy, but doesn't quite knock you out..."
0,Fresh,[Starbuck] is a heartwarming yet highly problematic film if taken from an ethical point of view.
0,Fresh,"Chuck & Buck won't make for the most relaxed evening's entertainment by any means, but it is funny and daring, and well worth the occasional shudder."
0,Fresh,You won't always love these characters. But you'll always love watching them.
0,Fresh,"At once desperately grim and unnervingly gripping, providing an exacting sense of the detail and procedure that went into death by hanging."
0,Fresh,"I think that this movie has enough ""jump scares,"" and interesting visuals to keep most people entertained."
1,Rotten,"Made for an audience of no one, Dark Shadows is a mess of campy horror, ""fish out of coffin"" comedy, and gothic melodrama."
0,Fresh,"As an actor, Eastwood has rarely taken on a character as complex as Frankie Dunn."

0,Fresh,"While this film is way too long and might be more for Tolkien devotees than mainstream audiences, after a slow start it turns into a rousing adventure with plenty of visual flair and top-notch action sequences."
1,Rotten,"I like dogs, but this movie is almost bad enough to be one."
0,Fresh,"In most regards (We still miss Kevin Bacon), this is a ""new and improved"" ""Footloose,"" funnier, sunnier and funkier. Simply put, it works."
0,Fresh,"Stories We Tell is clearly a form of creative catharsis for Polley. Yet through its clarity and sincerity her documentary gathers greater meaning, transcending its humble origins and effortlessly enrapturing the audience with its bittersweet tale."
0,Fresh,"Though this isn't a typical awards-seeking performance from Fiennes, it certainly ranks among the actor's best."
0,Fresh,"I haven't seen many people use the word ""exquisite"" to describe Tarantino's movies. But they should."
0,Fresh,A dual story of accidental spiritual journeys [that] illuminates storytelling's scriptural capacity to impart life lessons...a charming little film [to see] on a big screen.
0,Fresh,"If the [potentially-intriguing] details of Wolverine's backstory are sometimes skimmed over, the movie at least delivers plenty of bang for your buck in the action department."
0,Fresh,"If this is raging against the dying of the light, long may he rage."
0,Fresh,"Tthe film relies on underlying tension, strong thematic resonance and another committed performance from Daniel Radcliffe."
0,Fresh,"The movie's enjoyable but almost wholly canned, coasting on the pleasure of its post-punk soundtrack and the novelty of the quiz-show scenes."
0,Fresh,"Laboring under the handicaps of a contrived script, an uncertain approach and personalities in essence playing themselves, the production never quite makes its point, but romps along merrily unconcerned that it doesn't."
1,Rotten,Overrated and dumb comedy with a few funny moments.
1,Rotten,"It is not so much ""bad"" as it is stunningly indifferent to providing anything beyond occasional surface-level entertainment value."
0,Fresh,"A great movie it isn't, but it's one hell of a funny excursion."
1,Rotten,"...screenwriter Black's idea of using the unreliable narrator for Hoover's history before long time companion Tolson outs him in the film's last act is a good one, but he cannot let go of the Lindbergh case..."
0,Fresh,"As a true story, it makes great drama - preferable if you don't already know the history."
1,Rotten,"With its flashy, music-video style edits, rock-scored montages and septuagenarian cast, it's hard to say who, exactly, is the right audience for this unusual comedic drama from director Michael Schroeder."
1,Rotten,"Not half as terrifying as Norwegian black metal, but still one of the better found footage-gimmicked sequels in recent memory."
1,Rotten,The film prefers the illusion of intellectual rigor over the real thing.
1,Rotten,"The screenwriters just seem to be asking for it when they have Edwards demand of his scruffy team, ''Must you and the others reduce everything to its crudest terms?'' The answer is sadly obvious."
1,Rotten,"What's all wrong here, is that this girl bonding and binging horror spree isn't funny enough, or sufficiently scary when it's supposed to be. Though Megan's teen fanboys should have their satisfied fill, especially those who crave babes with bite."
1,Rotten,"The film seems to take its method entirely from Darwan's quiet, methodical patter about how to move safely across lanes and through intersections. It's good advice for driving, but less helpful for drama."
1,Rotten,"Just another threadbare, gravely puerile James Bond movie but marketed directly at your children. . . which is something to think about."
0,Fresh,"Artfully and cleverly, the sweet spirit of that young bear from darkest Peru and his many London misadventures materializes brilliantly on screen in the very good hands of writer-director-conjurer Paul King."
0,Fresh,"Intensely gripping drama full of smart, thoughtful, personal twists on some familiar sci-fi ideas. Hums with the hope that a better world is within reach."
0,Fresh,"Stylishly told and earnestly acted, Precious is a far from pleasant cinemagoing experience but a worthwhile one."
0,Fresh,This is the movie edges of seats were invented for. One of those near perfect horror films that will be scaring people for generations.
1,Rotten,The hangover on the third day of a three-day binge makes you wonder why you decided to go there in the first place. Apparently it's the same for movies.
0,Fresh,"A character-driven, non-linear multi-strand period neo-noir thriller with an all-star cast and a cavalcade of snappy duologues? It's practically a film buff's fantasy."
0,Fresh,"If you've ever wondered about Scientology, you can't go past this riveting doco by Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney"
1,Rotten,One could be forgiven for thinking of Raise Your Voice as a Disney Channel special that was mistakenly spun out into the multiplexes.
1,Rotten,'The Dressmaker' needs some alterations.
0,Fresh,"At times, Rich Hill has the vibe of an Errol Morris-esque portrait of small-town oddballs, but there is also an ethnographical bleakness to this portrait of angry boys."
1,Rotten,"Despite its title, seems at heart a sour, misanthropic mixture of sexual grossness and slapstick."
0,Fresh,"'The Photograph' is unapologetic, unproblematic, and imperfect in all the ways that Black folk were often not allowed to be."
0,Fresh,"300 perpetuated the myth that the best way to survive life was to either shout at the top of your lungs or fight in slow motion. Centurion simplifies that formula by eliminating the shouting and just gives us the gory deaths, mostly at normal speed."
1,Rotten,"Brosnan's Bond is all lightweight bonhomie, but he is positively Oscar-worthy compared to Richards."
0,Fresh,"It's a fine bit of writing and directing from Mark O'Rowe and John Crowley, who also gets good work from their cast."
1,Rotten,"In his first fictional feature, [Jarecki ] can't decide whether to opt for the open-ended inquiry of a non-fiction film or the resolved storytelling of Hollywood genre movie, so he winds up stranded in between."
0,Fresh,Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling was nostalgia resurrection done right. I enjoyed pretty much everything about it.
1,Rotten,"It's a plodding, derivative gothic potboiler: The Shining meets Coraline, with a touch of Gremlins played (boringly) straight."
0,Fresh,"If you're a die-hard Four Seasons fan, your only complaint about Jersey Boys will be that Clint Eastwood couldn't stuff every last hit song in. But it wasn't for lack of trying - and face it, you've still got those old records at home anyway."
0,Fresh,"It works, and has the makings of a cult comedy to-be."
0,Fresh,"It definitely could have been better, but can we really gripe about a Christmas movie about a vengeful goat monster from the underworld?"
1,Rotten,Is breathtaking in its mediocrity and wrong-headedness.
1,Rotten,A movie where the roundhouse kicks land considerably better than the quips.
0,Fresh,Both glorious to behold and a wonderful tale of the medieval struggle between Christianity and Celtic animism.
1,Rotten,"Jones doesn't quite know how to manage all the quirk and slapstick of the picture, which never comes together as completely as it could, disappointing on multiple levels."

1,Rotten,"If this movie had been made by an unknown young director, a lot of critics would still be panning the movie for its inconsistencies -- but many others would be praising his courage."
0,Fresh,Fun With Dick and Jane is the best kind of remake: It takes a dated film most people haven't seen or vaguely remember and updates the basic premise in a way that plugs it into here and now.

0,Fresh,Lovely.
0,Fresh,If you're looking for a family film that questions moral determinism then Boxtrolls is your only man.
1,Rotten,"Your monster enemy's monster enemy is your monster friend in ""Kong: Skull Island"", as is the CGI which is genuinely thrilling. But overall it's bloated and overlong, with so many characters running around it feels like the last night of ""Big Brother""."
1,Rotten,"If There's Something About Mary is the Farrelly brothers' gold standard for quality, The Heartbreak Kid comes in as pyrite--or fool's gold."
1,Rotten,Lacks the Strength of its Flimsy Convictions
0,Fresh,"Call it The Not-Half-Bad Gatsby. Or rather, it is half-bad, but the not-bad half turned out better than expected."
1,Rotten,"The latest example of a thriller in which the beginning and the end make at least a tiny bit of sense, but the connecting stuff in between is just an inscrutable muddle of dumb twists, red herrings and ho-hum shockeroos."
0,Fresh,"A mythic, visually resplendent rendering of a familiar coming-of-age story, ""Good Dinosaur"" soars on the emotional power of the widescreen compositions, which stir deep, almost primal feelings about childhood and the untamed ferocity of the natural world."
0,Fresh,"Amelie meets The Pianist in I Served the King of England, one man's surreal journey through 30 years of Czech history."
1,Rotten,A post-wartime love triangle drama that champions The Bleeding Obvious with every frame.
1,Rotten,"There is a dance number in the streets of London that ""goes viral"" in a way that suggests director Richard Loncraine doesn't know what the term means. And every plot turn is mapped out and signposted, with the script taking the easy path every time."
1,Rotten,"So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney won't do it one more time, as far as movies are concerned."
0,Fresh,"As in Antwone Fisher, which helped make a star of Derek Luke, Washington draws effortless performances from his young actors, which go a long way in making The Great Debaters more enjoyable than you might expect."
0,Fresh,"Detroit encourages its audiences to observe the oppressive power structures, suggesting that America is on a very long road towards a fully shared recognition of the need for change."
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, I'd recommend this film for fans of anthology horror films, but it's far from a classic."
1,Rotten,Might be best just to let these sleeping Old Dogs lie. This incredibly loony comedy sort of demeans everyone involved.
1,Rotten,A meditation on love and lost paradise that starts with breathtaking assurance and slowly crumbles into self-parody.
1,Rotten,A pedantic supernatural hybrid of Inherit the Wind and Audrey Rose.
0,Fresh,The beautiful cinematography and rousing musical score are excellent throughout.
1,Rotten,"A pedestrian Australian drama that's big on scenery and long, meaningful silences but short on story."
0,Fresh,"Ambiguity enlivens the smart, knotty Resolution, which routinely nods to its own artificiality while positing storytelling as a constantly evolving beast apt to save your life one moment and consume you the next."
1,Rotten,Ultimately hollow!
0,Fresh,An oddly likeable film that grows on you if you're willing to stick with it.
1,Rotten,Turturro has many dots that he never connects here.
1,Rotten,"It doesn't take long to realize that ""Outlaws and Angels"" is going to feel as long as the conquering of the west itself, with Mollner incapable of finding rhythm for this intentionally odious movie."
0,Fresh,"A gory, totally fun throwback action spectacle."
0,Fresh,"... lusty and heartfelt, fiery flamenco and spirited country jig. Don't go expecting a Disney-fied fable. Berger seasons with S&M and the kind of macabre touches you'd expect in vintage Browning or Bunuel."
1,Rotten,The film is non-illuminating. It depresses you but doesn't change your life.
0,Fresh,"Watching mortals sort through relationships is not just an intelligent way to spend an afternoon -- it's downright refreshing. The characters are so honest, so thoughtful, and so utterly real that you feel genuine interest in their plight."
0,Fresh,A convoluted crime caper with strong ethical underpinnings to support its many moods and styles.
0,Fresh,"Capernaum may be a flawed portrait of the voiceless masses whose daily lives mock all the lofty ideals of the state it portrays, but its rallying cry demands to be heard nonetheless."
1,Rotten,"Is Scorsese desperate? This screenplay has the scent of it, as if he is scraping for material to feed his basic filmic interests."

1,Rotten,What if Superman started out evil? And what if that was the only idea you had for your movie?
0,Fresh,"This is dopey Hollywood mysticism all right, but thanks to considerable craft and showmanship, it packs an undeniable punch."

0,Fresh,... the intense physicality of his images-sometimes harsh but often filled with mystery-puts you in their places as surely as anything by Terrence Malick or Steven Spielberg.
0,Fresh,"There's a neat free spirit versus family values message here, about a dad being no big deal when you can have three. Not to mention that family is more about who loves you, than whatever does or doesn't dangle between their legs."
1,Rotten,We've seen this corporate morality tale done better many times before.
0,Fresh,[A] playful but ominously open-ended documentary about a motley crew of Danes headed to Greenland on a schooner.

0,Fresh,Flawless victory.
1,Rotten,A weak Bad News Bears-style rip-off. Totally unoriginal.
0,Fresh,"Overall, Trollhunter isn't the most fast-paced or sweat-inducing of the recent pack of naturalistic low-budget horror films. However, it is perhaps the drollest, driest and most effects-laden of the bunch."
1,Rotten,"Atmospheric chills and some solid performances ... keep the tension up for a while, until the nasty and disquieting finale."
1,Rotten,"The Protector 2 is a sadly misguided action abomination filled with ugly visuals and confused characters, failing to showcase any genre competency in the least bit."
0,Fresh,This is exactly what you want for your kids the last week of summer.
0,Fresh,On Chesil Beach remains a solid exercise in applied sadness. Few will be entirely unmoved. Few will be wholly satisfied.
0,Fresh,"A huge part of the charm of Midnight in Paris derives from the finely calibrated casting, long one of Allen's superpowers as a director."
1,Rotten,"Day-Lewis gives a spirited performance in this too long, plotless character study. Whether it's histrionic or award-quality has to be up to the viewer."
0,Fresh,"This may be a drama about breast cancer, but it's astutely written and played with a jagged sense of humour that makes it thoroughly entertaining."
0,Fresh,"As tension builds inside the pilot who made headlines . . . so does the tension build in this film by director Clint Eastwood. Before you know it, you're wrapped up in the drama...."
1,Rotten,"It remains a failure, though a fascinating one because it's so unusual and borne of the filmmaker's ambition."
1,Rotten,"If Vin Diesel and a goofy sci-fi/superhero mash-up premise are enough to get your nanites pumping, then by all means, enjoy. Otherwise, Bloodshot will simply leave you cold."
0,Fresh,"Instead of focusing on what keeps the film from being great, or sometimes even good, consider what makes this an exciting debut"
0,Fresh,"In his not especially funny yet oddly appealing new comedy, Woody Allen manages to act his age and prove theres life in those old jokes yet."
0,Fresh,"Moormann's film transcends A&E hagiography, and Dowd's spry egoism and science-hipster joie de vivre provide piquant icing."
0,Fresh,"Murphy and an uncharacteristically restrained Lawrence are a solid team, and Ted Demme's sympathetic direction allows them to draw as much humor out of the dismal situation as they can."
0,Fresh,Hawke argues movingly that creative success has nothing to do with fame and everything to do with how an artist grows as a person and impacts the people around him.
0,Fresh,"Despite cringing at many of Betty's deluded interactions with the residents of her final destination and the director's seeming lack of faith in the believability of many of the scenes, Nurse Betty still turns out to be entertaining."
0,Fresh,"This is a sexy, loose, lively and completely intoxicating performance, and as much as I like Donald Sutherland and Bob Hope I'll take Ledger's take on the iconic character over theirs any day."
1,Rotten,"It is one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children."
1,Rotten,"Downsizing never quite goes where you think it's going, and normally, I'd say that's a +. But confounding expectations only goes so far. You still have to get to a place worth getting to."
0,Fresh,"This isn't a great 'Gatsby,' but it's quite a good one...Despite the spectacle-for-spectacle's sake filmmaking philosophy and lack of interpretive depth the picture works on its own terms."
0,Fresh,"...a sci-fi parable about bigotry and corporate greed that, backed by Jackson's special effects house WETA, brings a whole new world to the Science Fiction genre."
0,Fresh,"We hear the other side -- the people who have left the organization ... What they have to say is equal parts fascinating, disquieting, and downright frightening."
1,Rotten,Even more tasteless than its main character's gold 'n' marble palace.

0,Fresh,"Whatever the flaws, many from the books, this second grittier, more confident round of Hunger Games thrills us into submission."
0,Fresh,Typical western with some shrill women.
1,Rotten,"The problem with Skiptrace is that it seems as a labored and redundant rag-tag vehicle trying to bask in the shadowy spirit of Chan's typical big screen, high-wire Hong Kong police procedurals from yesteryear."
1,Rotten,... a retread that retraces what was funny in the first film but isn't anymore since the surprise and delight of discovery is gone.
0,Fresh,One of the year's most important documentaries ...
1,Rotten,"Goldberger makes the most of his eclectic, multi-Oscar-nominated cast to make up for the lack of scope and visual panache, not to mention the sometimes strained machinations of his plot"
1,Rotten,"It features two bitter, bickering stereotypes who are meant to represent a realistic married couple, but they don't. Not once."
0,Fresh,A kid's movie the rest of us can stand (or even enjoy).
1,Rotten,"Like Justin Bieber or Katy Perry, Conner isn't quite entertaining enough for an entire feature film."
1,Rotten,"Jeff Bridges gives his otherwise bland character a unique accent (speech impediment?), delivering all of his lines as a mix of his True Grit character, a belligerent walrus, and a 45 rpm record played at 33-1/3 rpm."
0,Fresh,"Here we have a celebration of male camaraderie and masculinity that comes at the expense of no one, a sex comedy that is both sexy and comedic."
1,Rotten,"Despite the presence of some finely tooled parts, the new animated feature Robots lumbers under the weight of a story that might have rolled off a Hollywood assembly line."
0,Fresh,"Gillespie's film in a breath of fresh, icy air, in the midst of so many serious and emotionless films that only seek to win prizes. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,An exhilarating celebration of a national pastime.
1,Rotten,"""Take This Waltz"" not only does not work despite all of the aforementioned qualities, it doesn't work in such strange and inexplicable ways that I found myself more baffled than angry with it."
1,Rotten,"Tears are shed, women are beaten, and time lurches between the 1930s and the 1990s, yet little actually occurs in the movie, which loses narrative concentration in a hurry."
0,Fresh,"The film's funniest moment caught me at a loss of breath, and at its best has other moments providing extended laughs, if not of the breathtaking variety."
0,Fresh,"An entertaining, true-life 'fish out of water' story worth catching on the big screen."
0,Fresh,"One thing is for sure, The High Note is an undeniable surprise that will elevate your soul as it helps dispel the gloom of reality for a solid two-hour romp."
0,Fresh,"Aeon Flux is not a instant classic or a pants-wettingly exciting adaptation of a forgotten graphic novel, but it is also not a Catwomanesque career killer nor a wasted 93 minutes."
1,Rotten,"Anti-American Sniper. In the murky midst of multiple mercenaries, a two-timing damsel in distress, corporate conmen, a differently duplicitous Javier Bardem checking in, macho mayhem and matadors. And in any case, an anti-hero somewhat saved by the bull."
0,Fresh,A black comedy that nonetheless manages to tap into the sense of alienation and unfocused rage so prevalent in today's kids.
1,Rotten,"Guns, blah, blah, blah, drugs, blah, blah, blah, guns, drugs, and money, blah, blah, blah."
0,Fresh,A bewitching fantasy.
0,Fresh,"I don't want to oversell The Rocker, but in a summer of erratic, assaultive comedies all up and down the budget scale, this Rainn Wilson vehicle -- a kind of Home School of Rock -- stakes out its own corner of the market."
1,Rotten,It's pretty by the numbers.
1,Rotten,"So long as the Brits are sweeping obsolete institutions like the House of Lords into the dustpan of history, may we recommend the broom for James Bond?"
1,Rotten,The film version of Khaled Hosseini's novel is so portentously sincere that you may feel like a cretin for embracing it with anything less than a full heart.

1,Rotten,Just because you CAN remake a piece of crap like this does not mean that it's a good idea.

0,Fresh,Classy entertainment.
0,Fresh,"Despite a shaky premise, an engaging cast and a sinuous storyline make Sugar Mountain a moderately diverting adventure."
0,Fresh,"A filmmaker who is always cerebral and occasionally very soulful, Jarmusch -- fascinating even at his most tepid -- could do better to have a lot more red blood flowing through his recent work and a little less ice water."
1,Rotten,Mixed with the flashes of absolute brilliance are long dead sections. The film left me more often bored than entertained. It's a certain candidate for my list of this year's most overrated movies.
1,Rotten,"Ritchie is trying, with mighty self-regard, to give us Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Broadswords. But that just makes it more excruciating, not less."
1,Rotten,Displays some decent visual gimmickry but shoots for mystical and epic but ultimately feels laboured and pointless.
1,Rotten,I felt as if the theater had tapped into a cable broadcast coming into a house down the street.
0,Fresh,"Trying so forcefully to evoke a reaction isn't always a flaw, and pays off when the movie's second half comes around, but Gibson's indulgences are always noticeable."

0,Fresh,"...an easygoing, straightforward film without too many surprises"
0,Fresh,"When it comes to an emotional payoff at the end, unlike most Hollywood films, it has earned it."
0,Fresh,"If After Tiller does not feel grim, despite the overwhelming presence in it of death and mourning, that's perhaps because it is so much a film about intimacy and trust."
1,Rotten,A cartoon of retribution and revenge.
0,Fresh,Demands we throw out our preconceived notions and face the issue without walls to protect us.
0,Fresh,"It doesn't coast on its premise but follows where it leads, which is into some serious territory. What might have been a joke with a tagged-on sentimental ending becomes instead a sensitive movie that affirms the value of life."
1,Rotten,"a very typical, yet ultimately dull, story about the challenges of her new life"
0,Fresh,"It's sporadically hilarious, with some inspired gags and deranged pranks, but for a Jackass movie, this is oddly gentle and sometimes even sentimental."
0,Fresh,After watching this you may think twice before consuming another mouthful of tuna.
0,Fresh,"Make no mistake about it: Mr. Williams's performance, though it's full of uproarious comedy, is the work of an accomplished actor. ''Good Morning, Vietnam'' is one man's tour de force."
1,Rotten,"Once the novelty of all the celebrity impersonations wears off, the film never gives you much of a reason to care about the predicaments of its cardboard characters."
0,Fresh,"While the film may not entirely hang together, the stakes are low, and its bright spots point toward a promising future for the behind the camera talent."
0,Fresh,Claire Denis's High Life is a sensually intimate journey that overwhelms. An intoxicatingly wonderful space odyssey into the psyche of the human condition.
0,Fresh,Marsh and cinematographer Benoît Delhomme's exquisite harnessing of light and the former's guiding of Jones and Redmayne to performances of surpassing delicacy elevate such passages to something beyond Douglas Sirk.
0,Fresh,"Okay, so it's Midnight Run meets All The President's Men, but the Lemmon-Garner rapport is dynamite and the glittering support cast of Lauren Bacall, Dan Aykroyd and John Heard are given sparkling dialogue."
0,Fresh,"Hey - what if food could talk, and it said funny stuff while cursing like a sailor? That, + the sex scene (really), make ""Sausage Party"" one you probably want to attend."
1,Rotten,"The central mystery itself grows increasingly obvious as the film goes on, which resultantly means the second half of the film drags along until the ultimate revelations come out."
1,Rotten,Bow-wow out of this one.
0,Fresh,"Epic yet intimate, Les Misérables is a standing-ovation triumph."
0,Fresh,What elevates this nouveau Willard above similar restorations of used pulp is the way it sustains the original's queasy menace while applying neatly stylized layers of grit and wit.
1,Rotten,"Like the characters in virtually all road-trip movies, this mismatched pair stumbles into a series of chance encounters and misadventures."
0,Fresh,"For his fifth feature film, Guy Ritchie happily ignores his previous two misfires and goes back to what he does best, making dime-store, knockoff pulp thrillers."
1,Rotten,"While the film may justify its title in terms of the viscera on display, it is badly in need of a funny bone."
0,Fresh,[Director Bradley Cooper] intelligently allows music to exist almost as a character and dedicates whole sequences to musical acts. [Full review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,...an old-fashioned ghost story that understands people are more frequently haunted than places.
1,Rotten,"Mandy Moore is so likable, while Robin Williams is so not. [But] John Krasinski is like wallpaper. He's just there."
0,Fresh,"With harmonious felicity, Foster and McKenzie trace Granik's story like a twig parting sand. She couldn't have asked for a better duo."
0,Fresh,"Leonard Cohen, the darkly rumbling hipster-Buddhist-poet-troubadour gets his own loving tribute in this concert film/testimonial."
1,Rotten,The script is serviceable and sporadically amusing but lacks spark and polish; the pacing feels not brisk but downright brusque.
1,Rotten,It's not so much that it's indifferent film -- it's too arch to be bad. More that it's a disappointment.
1,Rotten,"The film is too wan and distanced to sweep you up, but it holds you, and it doesn't - unlike most Hollywood biopics - leave you feeling as if you need a shower."
1,Rotten,"Morbid medium hates the dead. Hereafter, Clint must write a new soundtrack or just retire to a Tuscany farmhouse to enjoy old age."
0,Fresh,"A spellbinding tale of luxury, incest, madness and matricide..."
0,Fresh,One of the most deeply moving film experiences of the year.
0,Fresh,What Colossal gets modestly wrong in terms of mildly mixed messaging and on-the-nose metaphor is easily forgiven when considering how unapologetic it is about the importance of its monstrous actual subject.
1,Rotten,... a highly derivative teenage sex comedy that borrows liberally from Judd Apatow's soulful geek movies
0,Fresh,This one should satisfy even the hungriest of Hannibal fans.
1,Rotten,"Suffice it to say, you'd be safer to leave this one floating without a life jacket and just renting the '87 one again."
0,Fresh,A quietly alarming thriller.
0,Fresh,"The Fang's eccentric pranks are enough to give the movie a fresh and amusing twist on the typical family drama about the psychic wounds of childhood, and the lengths to which kids will go in seeking their parents' approval."
1,Rotten,"The laughs come and go, but Ferrell makes NASCAR his bitch funny. Funnier. And more fun. And then the fun skids to a stop."
0,Fresh,What an ingenious concept.
0,Fresh,"Hand made of genre conventions at a dramatic and structural level, but what it does very well is to take advantage of its actors: Ethan Hawke, Rose Byrne and Chris O'Dowd. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Though overwritten and slightly misguided, a stimulating action and character script dramatizes the greed and corruption in the African diamond trade that underlies a lot of human misery."
0,Fresh,This is a special gem of a movie.
0,Fresh,"A White, White Day is a masterclass in balance, contrast and restraint, as profoundly moving as it is refreshingly bereft of cliché."
1,Rotten,There's something about professional comedians breaking down what's funny for civilians that gets annoying after a while.
1,Rotten,"Look closely and you will see that Taken is not a harmless piece of action fluff. It is a fraud, and a mean-spirited one at that."
1,Rotten,"Without the grandiose narrative structure of the six live-action releases, this feels even more pointless, a mechanical attempt to milk the kids for every last dime."
0,Fresh,A classic must-see. It remains potent to this day.
0,Fresh,"Yeah, Pixar movies are usually good, but this one's unimaginably great."
0,Fresh,"Empire of the Sun is not as graphic as the hellish worlds of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, but Spielberg doesn't sugarcoat the horrors of war."
1,Rotten,Biopic about artist's relationship with his bullying mother.

0,Fresh,Vanessa Redgrave has never been more likable on screen than in her buoyantly athletic turn here.
0,Fresh,Gleeful schlock that almost achieves bad movie greatness.
1,Rotten,Hotel Transylvania is a chief offender when it comes to the issues plaguing mainstream animation today and in a number of ways is a significant step back for Sony Pictures Animation after their hit Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
0,Fresh,"The Florida Project is a fantastic piece of writing, a showcase for a couple of breakout performances... and a film we will be hearing a lot more about as award season gets into swing."
1,Rotten,"Breakthrough film maker Josh Koury's latest documentary manages to go to the head of the parade of Potter fans, but the average viewer may not be sure why he went to the trouble."
1,Rotten,A lot of talent wasted in a forgettable potboiler
1,Rotten,This just kind of fell flat.
1,Rotten,It's ironic that a film about an attempt that had some pretty serious flaws feels like its creators made a few mistakes of their own.
0,Fresh,One of the most accessible of joy rides.
0,Fresh,"Schamus uses minimal narration and a spare directorial style to make the inner lives of his characters intelligible, without losing their complexity."
0,Fresh,"Sweetly sentimental, it's a low-key, feel-good family film."
1,Rotten,"Fascinating enough to hold our interest, even as it drifts away from its early promise and tries just a bit too hard to bring all of the plot threads to a happy, tidy conclusion. But then, believability isn't an issue here."
0,Fresh,"What emerges is an intensely personal film from the cynic who brought us ""Kurt & Courtney"" and ""Biggie and Tupac."" It's also Bloomfield's most emotional work."
0,Fresh,"You don't need to be a fan of the show to find enjoyment out of this movie, which is endearing regardless of its overly simple plot and sometimes asinine sense of humor."
1,Rotten,"a hipster movie, affectedly exhausted and cocksure with no justification for it. And like anything hipster, you sort of want to kick it in the teeth."
0,Fresh,"Conveys an unforgettable sense of all that's stolen when children are abused-as well as the heroic bravery, compassion and togetherness required to combat such cruelty."
0,Fresh,"A stylish, confused and insanely violent gangster drama from a first-time Brit director."
0,Fresh,"It's powerful stuff, but Ophuls' graceful, gliding camera movements provide a sense of beautiful inevitability."
1,Rotten,"As stylish and flashy as the action is this time around, I can still only recommend Underworld: Awakening to diehard fans of the series."

0,Fresh,A tale of obsession with less hot air than your average thriller.
0,Fresh,"Breakfast With Scot is not only amusing and heartfelt, but also genuinely thoughtful about life's many unexpected turns."
0,Fresh,"Chock full of amazing weather-beaten faces, it's warmly nostalgic without stooping to cheap sentiment and certainly less miserablist than a summary may suggest."
1,Rotten,"A badly acted, unoriginal, irritating movie...Easily one of the worst films of 2001."
0,Fresh,"This remake of Disney's 1991 classic is remarkably faithful, using present-day digital animation effects to give the story a photo-realistic sheen. The addition of more songs makes it feel much more like a big movie musical."

0,Fresh,"A gently intelligent action sci-fi with wit, drama, and emotion to spare, this is the blockbuster you've been waiting for all year."
0,Fresh,"There was no way, shape or form that HELLBOY II would meet its expectation, but even with all of the anticipation, the film managed to entertain just enough... In the end, what you'll get is another fun, yet forgettable summer blockbuster."

0,Fresh,"There are so many good elements about David Michod's feature film debut that when it fails to make a substantial impact, the remorse overwhelms you."
1,Rotten,A sterile scenario that takes entirely too much time to bring us to an ending that assumes we'll find it as nifty as it thinks itself to be.
0,Fresh,It is just about perfect.
0,Fresh,"It's a gleeful kitchen sink throwback to the satiric, absurdist, wildly inventive indies of the '80s, '90s, and early 2000s..."
0,Fresh,A doozy of a story packed with visual surrealism and clever plot surprises.
1,Rotten,Comes off as something that might have been made by Lagerfeld's own army of publicists in Paris.

1,Rotten,Another regulation teen comedy.
0,Fresh,"Neither as bad as you've probably heard, nor is it anywhere near as good as I might have hoped."

0,Fresh,"The success of this effect, which helps elevate the movie above a classy disease-of-the-week saga, rests firmly on Russell Crowe's performance, and it's a strikingly good and moving one."
1,Rotten,"...the film turn into just another ""Saw"" sequel (- the flimsy moralizing)..."
0,Fresh,"The third tale tops it all, thanks to a sweet, tough performance by Lily Gladstone."
1,Rotten,"Maclaine's performance as Tess Carlisle, which shifts from polite witchiness to lonely, mildly boozy poignancy, adds up to the only real reason to see this potentially funny and revealing, but actually rather humdrum duodrama."
1,Rotten,"Penn sports little of the squirrelly charm evidenced by the original Van Wilder star, Ryan Reynolds."
0,Fresh,This isn't Ferrell's first dramatic role; he played seriocomic leading men in Stranger Than Fiction and Woody Allen's Melinda and Melinda. But it's the first one that provides a glimpse at his possible future as a Bill Murray-style character actor.
1,Rotten,"In Robin Hood, you can't see the forest for the cheese."
1,Rotten,Kwak is a talented veteran auteur. But he has a tendency to go one step too far in depicting the emotions and dramas of his films.
0,Fresh,"Quirky, heartfelt acting makes this a superior entry in the perennial teenage-misfit genre."
1,Rotten,"It soon becomes obvious that there is no avoiding the burden of predictability: there is nothing, essentially, in the film's story that we don't know already."
0,Fresh,"Blunt, dreamy and visceral new adaptation of the immortal work of William Shakespeare, technically very lucid and brilliantly defended by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. [Full review in Spanish]"

1,Rotten,Depressing
0,Fresh,"A smart, fresh film, savvy enough to make a John Hughes reference a throwaway gag and not a mission statement."
1,Rotten,"The story is based on real incidents, but the uplifting tone is laid on so thick that it's difficult to believe a minute of it."
0,Fresh,It was fun.
1,Rotten,A step away from Springtime for Hitler -- a classic awful.

0,Fresh,"By opening their movie with the mature Jane, the filmmakers forge an emotional bond between her and the audience."

0,Fresh,"Even though it's only August, I'm not going out on a limb when I say that ""The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill"" is one of the best films of the year."
0,Fresh,"Faith, the second film in the Paradise trilogy, may not be as effective as its predecessor, but its story of a recently converted fundamental Christian woman and her now-handicapped Muslim husband returning after a two-year absence is still quite good."

1,Rotten,"The Foreigner gives us a new look at Chan, which is worth something."
1,Rotten,"Broad comedies are always something of a roll of the dice. And while The House isn't an absolute disaster, it's undeniable that this is one that's crapped out."
0,Fresh,"Even when the conspiracies are at their wackiest - yes, someone suggests watching The Shining backwards - the documentary remains genially intrigued."
0,Fresh,"Extremely well acted, admirably evenhanded, and wholly respectful of a subject that could easily devolve into Lifetime-channel schmaltz. It just fails to make much of an impression."
0,Fresh,"It's exceptionally silly and it takes itself too seriously, but ultimately Titans is a stirring adventure full of derring-do and beefy men in too-short tunics."

0,Fresh,"Vikander crisply holds the screen as a naive rebel transformed by unspeakable suffering into a mature, independent young woman who remains open to the possibility of a new love and a rebuilt England."
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, Rossi accomplishes something meaningful: capturing the sense of a workplace during a time of great transition, and, simply by showing us the day-to-day grunt work of finding a story, argues for the future of an institution."
1,Rotten,"This trilogy is the film equivalent of bad sex. Part 1 was awkward foreplay. Part 2 went through the motions with monotonous moves. And now, Part 3 reaches a clumsy climax that's so obviously fake that you just want it to end."

1,Rotten,It's loud and full of vim -- but a little hollow and heartless.
1,Rotten,"Happy days for those who love this sort of thing. But Raimi's effort, perhaps because we hadn't seen the plot before, was infinitely more scary."
0,Fresh,"While American Fable isn't without its share of flaws, it's the type of inventive production that hints of happier endings to come."
0,Fresh,One hell of a story -- and hands down the best action flick of the year to date.
0,Fresh,"The tenets of the director's style (use of dead time, laconic and comic dialogue, deadpan performances) dovetail to satisfying effect here; Swinton and Hiddleston both give sublime performances ..."
1,Rotten,"Its central metaphor of a figurative monster turning into a real one is interesting, but it quickly sheds its power as it sexualizes Lily, making her complicit rather than the victim."
1,Rotten,"As the plot rolls inexorably-and tediously-on, the movie becomes more and more a cluttered, overstuffed CGI mess."
0,Fresh,"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason has its problems, but it made me laugh from start to finish, so how bad could it be?"
1,Rotten,"It feels a bit tired, a bit formulaic, a bit like too much studio input and script doctoring."
0,Fresh,"[A] playful, haunting film."
0,Fresh,"A solid creature feature, but not at all a revelatory one."
0,Fresh,Surprisingly entertaining.
0,Fresh,"Molly's Game has a little bit of everything: high-stakes gambling, a killer Jessica Chastain performance, true-story celebrity naughtiness and a smart, witty script by Aaron Sorkin."
0,Fresh,"Okay, so I liked it. I'm one of five people on the planet. Sue me, all right?"
0,Fresh,"While the ice age serves as the backdrop, Alpha is ultimately an emotional tale of survival which celebrates the bond between man and man's best friend."
0,Fresh,"An engrossing adult drama that relies on complex characterizations and twisty plotting, and doesn't ask us to accept its central character as a superman."
1,Rotten,Did Harrison Ford hope the shorn look would give his high-tech mogul Jock Goddard some edge? He certainly needed something to.
1,Rotten,"The truth is that it's dim, perfunctory and wide-eyed, at least in every moment when Bridges isn't on the screen."
0,Fresh,"In a scabrous follow-up to Happiness, Todd Solondz once again crafts a movie easier to admire than it is to like."
0,Fresh,The decidedly Nordic -- though not at all glacial -- O'Horten is a mixture of sweetness and deadpan that proves the Kaurismki/Andersson school of filmmaking still has new delights in store.
1,Rotten,It's essentially an advertisement for a similarly titled trading card game.
1,Rotten,"The Mysteries of Pittsburgh seems to be missing an essential element of drama, of risk, underneath its glossy, golden sheen."
0,Fresh,"The Way Back is smartly-made, carefully-paced adventure movie. It goes where many other films have gone before, but it never feels like it's just going through the motions."
0,Fresh,"Both Dorff and 12-year-old Elle Fanning give lovely, unforced performances. You can feel a tenderness building between them, and also a vast, upwelling reservoir of things they can't or won't talk about."
1,Rotten,"By trying to appeal to young women, middle-aged moms, gay men and spring-break bros at the same time, the movie spreads itself too thin, filling time better spent on manly moves with too much talk and obvious demographic pandering."
0,Fresh,"An ultimately satisfying venture with a few spot-on acting turns, but it is a tad too ordinary for a director who thrives when he is anything but."
1,Rotten,[Home Sweet Hell is] nothing more or less than a toothless satire of suburban conformity that might have felt a little more dangerous six decades ago.
0,Fresh,"The truth is that it works more often than it doesn't -- thanks in no small part to the central performances of Gosling, Mortimer, Schneider, Clarkson and Garner."
0,Fresh,I really loved it. I loved Maya.
0,Fresh,"An obvious labor of love, the film successfully comments on gays in the military, racism, xenophobia, and sexism in a sly, entertaining manner throughout."
1,Rotten,"There is no line, no thought in Masked and Anonymous that Bob Dylan hasn't articulated in his songs a hundred times, and better."
1,Rotten,"If only the Spierig brothers had made a thoughtful drama, inspired by a real-life eccentric, rather than a dull thriller, barely propelled by jump-out scares and creaky hallways."
0,Fresh,It's easy to see why Olivia Colman won the Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Anne.
1,Rotten,"While the tone stays faithful to Alan Moore's ""Hellblazer"" series, the film doesn't really work because Reeves is the wrong guy to play the title character."
1,Rotten,A mediocre movie with a good one trapped inside.
0,Fresh,"Wrath radiates the straight-forward, straight-faced pleasures of the mytho-muscular epics, like Hercules and Jason and the Argonauts, produced in Europe a half-century ago."
1,Rotten,"Although it's largely affable despite its shortcomings, the movie feels like a weak gesture rather than a grand slam."
0,Fresh,"""Vox Lux"" throws a lot at the wall, and while not all of it sticks, it still manages to rattle a nerve and linger long after the credits roll."
0,Fresh,"There's something nicely kinky in this lusciously photographed erotic Korean thriller by Im Sang-soo - at least for those who don't compare it to the far kinkier, out-there 1960 original by Kim Ki-young."
1,Rotten,"...as doofy, mawkish and unsubtle as the title makes it sound."
1,Rotten,"Directors Roger Allers and Jill Culton don't trust their material in the two big comic sequences, a sugar-fueled rampage in a convenience store, and a flood, and cut them too quickly for all the jokes to register."
0,Fresh,Pryor is fascinating in one of his earliest and infrequent dramatic bits and the films is not devoid of chemistry between the three leads.
0,Fresh,The dazzling camera work by master director Martin Scorsese makes 'Shutter Island' all the more creepy ... not unlike the director's 'Cape Fear' from years back.

0,Fresh,"Jason Bourne may or may not return, but it's hard to imagine another Bourne movie ever topping this one."
0,Fresh,"Monster Trucks feels like it was tailor-made for boys under 10 everywhere. Boys like monsters. Boys like trucks. At least, that's what the thinking is for a studio executive."
1,Rotten,"The action scenes are forgettable, the mythology is confusing and the bad taste comedy is hopelessly off-target."
1,Rotten,"If Danny Ocean and Barney Ross from The Expendables had a baby, it might look something like this - but should they?"
0,Fresh,"Certainly the film isn't without its flaws. Then again, perfection is in the eye of beholder."

0,Fresh,"Dark Water will leave some viewers scratching their heads, while others will be wide-eyed with appreciation. This viewer, at least, is reasonably wide-eyed."
1,Rotten,"My biggest complaint was how this story just completely fell apart in about 40 minutes. I wanted to feel sorry for Walter, but all I could do is shake my head and laugh."
1,Rotten,"A rather aimless and convoluted brain teaser that attempts to transfer the kind of introspective discourse literary device of novels, that is best just left on the page."
0,Fresh,"J.J. Abrams employs his formidable skills in a sort of glib cinematic sleight of hand, persuading us (for a while) that he delivers more than he really does."
0,Fresh,"Kids will enjoy it, and there are more than enough clever gags to keep parents amused. But the film lacks the tenderness and rich nostalgia that made The Muppets such an improbable delight."
0,Fresh,"Of all the ironies which fill the film, the most complementary may be that this is film which will not soon be forgotten."
0,Fresh,"As a horror movie, Jennifer's Body doesn't fully deliver. But as a comic allegory of what it's like to be an adolescent girl who comes into sexual and social power that she doesn't know what the heck to do with, it is a minor classic."
0,Fresh,"This isn't just the most playful, surprising action movie in years. It's also the funniest. They're not going where no man has gone before. But the way they go there ... wow."
0,Fresh,"Turn off the sound, and it's the most splendid-looking animated feature made in the U.S. in 2014."
0,Fresh,"While Evans is still great in the role and it's nice that this superhero film is actually ""about something,"" it lacks the heart of ""Captain America"" and the humor of ""The Avengers."""
0,Fresh,To create something so epic while also maintaining itself as a small and intimate film is something that's difficult to accomplish. Somehow Schlesinger is able to pull off that feat.
1,Rotten,The film is so clumsily -- and often confusingly -- told that you find yourself working awfully hard to stay with it.
0,Fresh,"A story of one woman, two suitors, and a passion for the pen."
1,Rotten,"If the goal of Apatow was to make a film that in itself was a metaphor for a 40-year-old person having a failed mid-life crises than he succeeded, if it was to actually make a good movie about being 40 than he failed."
1,Rotten,There's not much of a plot.
1,Rotten,"""The Bang Bang Club"" seems curiously oblivious to South Africa as a whole."
1,Rotten,"Nair's turgid, melodramatic travesty of Thackeray's gimlet-eyed satire."
1,Rotten,"It briefly hints at something supernatural, but then proceeds as a fierce thriller in a disappointing misstep."
0,Fresh,"For a premise that sounds a bit shaky, the cast of Role Models simply sell it."
0,Fresh,"Directed with style and wit by Sharon Maguire, who made the original, Bridget Jones's Baby delivers in every department."
0,Fresh,"The hard-hitting film makes most other school-based films resemble child's play, as careers and futures of both the teacher and student hang in the balance, in the uncaring hands of an indifferent system."
1,Rotten,"This isn't much more than an A&E biographical fluff piece -- with boobs, bad language and an attempt to turn the story into a warped love triangle."
0,Fresh,"Silverstein combines the documentary and the fictional with striking elegance, coherence, ductility, fluidity and sensitivity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"Pushing Tin bids for originality by focusing on an offbeat profession. Every other aspect is pretty stale, though, from the smart-alecky characters to the romantic-triangle plot."

0,Fresh,Last Train Home is a harrowing experience. Don't expect to come out smiling.
0,Fresh,It isn't quite the world of the books. But it's a perfectly magical and exciting one in its own right.
1,Rotten,"With its dearth of substance and its wandering focus, this is a middlebrow bodice-ripper posing as an epic that hasn't the foggiest idea of what it wants to say."
0,Fresh,"Maclean takes more interest in the journey than the destination. The stops along the way are alternately life-threatening, illuminating and abruptly, wildly funny."
1,Rotten,"Fire Birds has one director (David Green), two writers (Nick Thiel and Paul F. Edwards) and many laughs, all of them unintentional."
1,Rotten,"[It] has its moments, and will be a welcome respite for any middle schooler sitting through a boring lecture. But if we were ever asked if we wanted a second viewing, we'd have to quoth the raven: nevermore."

1,Rotten,The labored spirit of dirty-old-man humor ... prevails.
1,Rotten,"An avalanche-in-progress aside, there's no hook for the audience, who would probably have more fun getting drunk in the lodge."

0,Fresh,"It's a deeply assured piece of direction, and though it only plays a few emotional notes, they are ones that won't soon leave your memory."
0,Fresh,"If parents feel like they've seen much of Shorts before, its celebration of mayhem and restless, thrill-seeking vibe will absorb young viewers, especially as the boredom of late summer begins to set in."
0,Fresh,"Even the extra-loud crazies who were sitting a few rows behind me cheered for the characters. You know a horror flick has done its job when the audience is rooting for the characters versus yelling at the screen, 'Just kill 'em off!'"
0,Fresh,"Seinfeld's droll, witty observations add to the adult appeal of 'Bee Movie,' and youngsters will probably enjoy its eye-popping colors."
0,Fresh,Topical subject in the news. The screenplay delivers solid twists. Worth seeing.
0,Fresh,McKay has surrounded his lead with a wealth of guest stars and a funny script that borders on being manic.
1,Rotten,Funny little Nazis require rather more finesse than The Littlest Reich possesses.
0,Fresh,"All in all, I would still kinda recommend that you see this movie in the theatres, but don't worry if you miss it and catch it on video instead."
0,Fresh,It's immensely entertaining to watch.
1,Rotten,"It really is true how when you make a copy of a copy of a copy, the most recent one doesn't pack the most quality."
0,Fresh,"As evidence of Reese Witherspoon's maturation, it is a revelation."
1,Rotten,This is a movie that could give Oliver Stone a migraine.
0,Fresh,"While all signs point to 'culty' for this film, it actually has all the mainstream appeal of a brilliant comedy and a terrifying supernatural horror."
1,Rotten,"Poorly written, amateurishly acted and cheesily made,...this high school morality tale that recasts the old fairy tale for the 'Twilight' audience...resembles a chintzy Afterschool Special with supernatural overtones."
0,Fresh,"This isn't a great movie, but it is a special one."
1,Rotten,"In the wake of TV's powerhouse The Shield, Dark Blue comes off as something of a retread, with little of The Shield's electric fury, edgy camera work or deft characterizations."
0,Fresh,"An auspicious debut for Scott, but one whose ingredients are too familiar to really fizz. Green is great, though, in a dark-tinged role that plays to her strengths."
0,Fresh,"Preceding Bonnie and Clyde by a year, Arthur Penn's small-town drama, flaunting a top-notch cast (Brando, Redford, Jane Fonda) is a quintessential movie pointing to the thematic and tonal direction Hollywood would take in the late 1960s."
0,Fresh,"Why put yourself through such a sad movie, no matter how well it's made? Because ... movies this moving are rare birds that don't pass this way too often."
0,Fresh,"A strange, jagged-yet-fluid movie, wrapped in an entertainment industry satire, that's extremely direct in its frustration. Also: Every performance is fantastic."
1,Rotten,"The story of course has some lovely and wild ideas, but the picture doesn't know what to do with them, except to be painfully literal and elaborate about everything."
0,Fresh,"Cumberbatch is the one freaky touch in an otherwise conventional movie, but the conventions in this case work handsomely."
0,Fresh,"A tale as old as time: The House of Mouse does not believe in bad filmmaking and in the Wreck-It Ralph sequel they tap into their own vault of pop culture and produce a mélange of pure, unadulterated fun"
1,Rotten,"The feature directorial debut of 65-year-old Eric Werthman, who has been a practicing psychotherapist for a quarter of a century. If you're not already seeing a shrink, Mr. Werthman, may we suggest that you start immediately."
0,Fresh,"Not a sci-fi movie but a droll, totally charming, un-hokey romantic comedy about two misfits. The film belongs to Aubrey Plaza's deadpan, touching, understated performance."
1,Rotten,"For all the hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche, Nolan and Goyer haven't added much beyond a corny opening in which he falls down a well and is attacked by bats."
1,Rotten,"For all its visual sweep and propulsively violent action, this bloodthirsty rendition of the Old English epic can't overcome the disadvantage of being enacted by digital waxworks rather than flesh-and-blood Danes and demons."
0,Fresh,Dead funny and enjoyable: who'd have thought it?
1,Rotten,Post-apocalyptic westerns don't come much more lethargic and unoriginal than this B-movie.
0,Fresh,"When Harry Met Sally is alright as a piece of entertainment for a little while, but it is by far Reiner's worst film."
0,Fresh,It's the Backyard Acting Olympics.
0,Fresh,A flawed but serviceable thriller.
0,Fresh,Transcendent.
1,Rotten,"As O'Horten begins, it's clear that Horten will manage his retired life much the same as he has his working one, with consistent routines and a decided lack of improvisation."
0,Fresh,Aside from stumbling over some clunky visual metaphors Guzmn does a decent job of telling a story many outside Chile simply don't know.
0,Fresh,This film about cigarettes is addictive as the substance and much more fun. It's hard to believe that you could have compassion for someone who shills for Big Tobacco.
0,Fresh,"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark is stupid fun, a distaff, gothic version of Pee-wee's Playhouse."
0,Fresh,A sci-fi original.
0,Fresh,Bloodline delivers a lot of bloody fun.
0,Fresh,Neustadter and Weber's dialogue is simultaneously a showcase of naturalism and of calculated specificity. Nothing is over-explained or overstated. Nothing seems written.
1,Rotten,Catherine is an infinitely less convincing version of Arcadia's girl genius; the proof is just a MacGuffin; it runs out of plot and has not one idea in its head.
1,Rotten,Offensive and annoying.
0,Fresh,Larson's comedy chemistry with Jackson makes for good '90s-style buddy action.
1,Rotten,"The 2019 version of The Lion King is an apex of faux-live-action animation, with an impressive volume of photorealistic effects. It may be the dullest technological game-changer ever made."
1,Rotten,"While the angles are plentiful, this broad biopic of the famous reclusive author of The Catcher in the Rye feels like it might have benefitted from a little more focus and depth."
0,Fresh,The cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed.
0,Fresh,You don't judge artists by where they find their inspiration; you judge them by how they realize it. And in We Own the Night James Gray hits the bull's-eye.

0,Fresh,"Southside With You showcases a city as photogenic, dynamic, and charming as the lovers themselves."
1,Rotten,"Honestly, the only meaning I took away from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is that it makes Simple Jack look like Citizen Kane."
0,Fresh,"Even with its flaws, The Dark Knight Rises is a solid film. It just fails to live up to the magnificent legacy created by the first two movies in the trilogy. To be fair, they were incredibly hard acts to follow."
0,Fresh,It's the best war movie since Full Metal Jacket.
1,Rotten,"Zach Braff's latest is well-intentioned, but also drab and predictable."
0,Fresh,"Bouncy and campy, a cotton-candy entertainment feast."
0,Fresh,The underwater thriller 47 Meters Down works so well as a nail-biting example of nonstop tension for one reason: its matter-of-fact credibility.
1,Rotten,"Half cardboard and half flesh-and-blood, the film version of Tim Tyson's memoir Blood Done Sign My Name reminds us just how difficult it is to tell a story without that story turning into a storybook."
0,Fresh,"Certainly not a perfect comedy and definitely not one for all viewers, yet entertaining enough for what it's trying to do and be for its target audience."

1,Rotten,Rough Night wouldn't be fresh or funny no matter what gender it's written about or for.
0,Fresh,"Rudnick and director Frank Oz don't do anything radical with the original premise ... but they choose comedy over horror, and it's a wise decision."
0,Fresh,Splendid film version of the play. Intelligently done.
0,Fresh,"On balance, Red Sparrow is a reasonable choice for those who don't mind a fair amount of graphic sex and violence mixed in with the spying, back-stabbing, and double-dealing expected from this genre."
0,Fresh,"You do get a sense of estrangement and noirish atmosphere, which may be close to justifying the effort, if not the price of admission."

1,Rotten,"The problem with this film is that after a quick, fun beginning they repeat a similar journey from the first film. Except this time, Shrek and Artie argue instead of Shrek and Fiona."
1,Rotten,"The Lone Ranger has it all, but what you end up with is not much. It's an extravagantly squandered opportunity."
1,Rotten,The Old Man & the Gun is a gloriously condescending film.

0,Fresh,"""Moebius"" makes its freakish images so credible it demands the silent treatment, since its vulgar ingredients practically defy verbal limitations."
1,Rotten,"...as a film about rites of passage, specifically those when generally nice if dweeby boys pick up weapons and thus command the attention of hot blondes, it ends up being more than just sophomoric. It's also disquieting, and depressing."
0,Fresh,The Silence of Lorna is a film worth shouting about.
1,Rotten,"Slight, frothy and quasi-meaningful -- a 'lite' movie if ever there was one."
0,Fresh,"Throughout, the director, Kon Ichikawa, succeeds in making all the world a stage, mixing theatrical and cinematic devices with earthquake intensity."

0,Fresh,"Linked together by the deadpan, melancholy drawl of Taylor's narration, it's filled with parasites, charlatans and oddballs. Not to mention a succession of wonderful songs."
1,Rotten,"Though never quite feeling impersonal, this ""Lord of the Rings""-style fantasy film is as ungainly as the movie's hulking, fearsome monsters -- and not nearly as powerful."
0,Fresh,"Horrible Bosses is entertaining and brazen, a clear reminder that to make a good comedy, all you've really gotta do is make it funny."
1,Rotten,"We understand [McQuarrie] aspires toward meaningful complications, but with all the people and words in the way nothing sticks."
0,Fresh,"His horror hullabaloo, his succession of knowing campfire stories, the madly metaphorical, darkly funny, insidious dream-logic nightmare... is described by co-producer Sean McKittrick as ""an R-rated Amblin film,"""
1,Rotten,"Snatched piles bad ideas on good ideas and lame bits of gross-out humour on genuinely funny bits of character work, without ever building enough dramatic force or comic energy to craft a full movie from the results."
1,Rotten,The ridiculousness levels are very high.
1,Rotten,"Like a drunken karaoke version of a classic song, this derivative piece of filmmaking does little but blemish our memories of the magic it is trying to copy."

0,Fresh,"Watts is wonderful, and the story's forsaken-child theme still has plenty of horrific power."

0,Fresh,"'Edge Of Tomorrow,' with an intriguing premise and the ability to see it through to a satisfying conclusion, is more than razzle-dazzle visual effects."
1,Rotten,"The feature flatlines quickly, desperate to do anything that might trigger a reaction out of the audience. Considered, thoughtful screenwriting has no place here."

1,Rotten,"""[A] gonzo B-movie from the eighties created by Y.K. Kim, a martial arts instructor and inspirational speaker who took his talents to the big screen despite a complete lack of screen charisma or acting talent."""
1,Rotten,"Wisely, Zwick front-loads the film with its most pronounced asset: O'Connell. That strategy succeeds at partially dissuading attention from its other, much less praiseworthy features, namely hackneyed lines invoking run-of-the-mill melodrama."
0,Fresh,"Better living through chemistry is a debatable notion satirically explored in this briskly paced, suspenseful thriller."
1,Rotten,"A confused, confusing and too often glib treatise on matters of life and death."

0,Fresh,"It is interesting and ingenious, even if some of the kinky, queasy fascination that had been so intoxicating in the earlier scenes ebbs away."
1,Rotten,"It was made with great ingenuity and technical expertise on an exceedingly small budget. What's missing, however, is density, complexity and surprise."

0,Fresh,Kim's movie conjures a sense of spiritual discipline as suspenseful as it is stunning to watch and exhilarating to contemplate.
0,Fresh,"A merely acceptable adaptation that feels more like a supernatural thriller with a couple of references to the game, involuntarily funny dialogue, and decent performances, than a terrifying production. [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,"Perhaps not as fun as it wants to be, but the movie has high spirits and a refreshing perspective that goes a bit deeper than just grrrl power."
0,Fresh,"Coraline, director Henry Selick's adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel, is essentially a horror movie for kids, but it is also gentle and funny and whimsical, and even in its darkest moments, Selick never forgets who his target audience is."
0,Fresh,"At its best, Blaze feels like a cinematic translation of not just Blaze Foley's life but his music, anchored by two incredibly likable, lived-in performances."
1,Rotten,"Watching children act, when it's bad, is on par with having a tooth pulled; and suffice it to say, the adult acting is not much better."

0,Fresh,This frothy mix of magic realism and old movie cliches would be as unpalatable as Simply Irristible if not for Cruz's incandescent charisma.
1,Rotten,"Schumer and Hawn go dutifully through the film's paces, animating the movie with their mere presence while the best elements of their art stay in the closet for next time."

0,Fresh,"Intriguing, revealing and thoroughly entertaining, we are privy to a front row seat in the fashion show of the decade"
0,Fresh,"The film is in a better state of mind than its characters. Its humor comes, as the best humor does, from an acute observation of human nature. We have known people something like this. We smile in recognition."

0,Fresh,[mother!] is a sickeningly glorious mess.
0,Fresh,"It's as smart as it is stupid, it's very entertaining, it delivers on what you'd expect it to and holds a few neat surprises. In a summer that has so far mostly failed to deliver when it comes to comedy, this is a big step in the right direction."
0,Fresh,"A judicial drama that, without completely renouncing the thematic influence coming from Ozu, is heading this time to a story that is more connected with Kurosawa and his classic Rashomon. [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,"With a relentless pace and seamless effects, this offbeat alien invasion thriller combines non-stop action with real emotion and provocative political themes. So not only is it thunderously entertaining, but it also makes us think."
1,Rotten,"Bass seems to be sleepwalking through his part, Chriqui's performance is limited to a series of smiles, and Fatone's most significant contributions come from other parts of his body besides his mouth."

0,Fresh,[Kore-eda] seems content to rely on winning performances (especially from the kids) as the core of a pleasant but forgettable tale.
0,Fresh,"To its credit, it doesn't take itself seriously, and when you need a movie to not take itself seriously, you cast Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as your lead."
1,Rotten,"Way too uneven, and it doesn't have a lot of momentum. Even their relationship, I guess I was rooting for them just because they had the most screen time and they're attractive...there were no real emotional stakes here, just plain..."
0,Fresh,"The film might come off more like a gimmick movie than much else for sequences of its runtime, but it remains a welcome change of pace in our era of deafening studio filmmaking."
0,Fresh,An exuberant and creative film game that amps things up for a run of nonstop action that tantalizes the senses and bombards the mind with an adrenaline rush of stimuli.
0,Fresh,Howard seems caught in some no-man's land between the poetic force of Melville's novel and the discursive academic approach of Philbrick.
1,Rotten,An uninspired splatterfest that wears its vulgarity on its blood-caked sleeve and is cynical enough to use 9/11 in its vapid story line.

0,Fresh,A smart thrill ride with one magnificent finish.
0,Fresh,"Like a Chinese box, it has layers under layers, fictions within fictions. A mystery and an intricate triangular love story, it's also a tale about storytelling itself, the uses of art and artifice to make the unbearable bearable."

0,Fresh,"The Visit is not a perfect film, but it is fun and as the viewer you may laugh out loud or gasp."
0,Fresh,"Other than its 85-minute running time, the movie is in all other ways imperfect, which is just about what you want from one of Jim Carrey's slapdash slapstick comedies. Perfection would ruin it."

1,Rotten,"Barry Levinson, Jack Black and Ben Stiller owe us all a major a-poo-logy for this stinking pile of celluloid."
1,Rotten,"Set in Franco's Spain, this self-referential film-within-a-film is painfully dated and unfunny, and its mishmash of genres is even more off-putting."
1,Rotten,"Duff's character has problems too (she's tired of moving from city to city), but no actress this synthetically wholesome should engage in this much whining."

1,Rotten,"Balancing the elements of comedy and drama are never easy and Metro, Eddie Murphy's latest flick, proves how easy it is to mistep."
0,Fresh,"A rather unexpected and satisfying finale may leave some viewers in disbelief, but I found it charming and emotionally correct."
0,Fresh,"Ultimately, the otherwise likable 'Page One' only really fails in its attempt to say something."
1,Rotten,"If writer/director Craig Brewer were a member of the X-Men, he would be called 'FirstActo,' and his mutant power would be creating dynamic openings to movies. His enemy would be consistency."

0,Fresh,Coco is a heartwarming story about family and a well-crafted coming of age tale steeped beautifully in the traditions of Mexico's Día de los Muertos.
1,Rotten,"Garage Days feels like a movie that belongs in the garage; it's where you put things that you can't quite dismiss, but don't really like enough to have cluttering up your actual living quarters."
1,Rotten,...a strikingly judgmental movie in favor of liberal lifestyles.
1,Rotten,...it's regrettably the case that If I Stay is made of the stuff the [YA] genre's harshest critics presume it to be.
1,Rotten,"While a good director can spin a worthy movie from any subject, first-timer Carlos Brooks does surprisingly little with the jaw-dropper of a topic he chose."
0,Fresh,"Pfeiffer, as usual, is magnificently portraying the not so innocent and kind-hearted queen."
1,Rotten,Nothing says action film like a bad guy monologuing for five minutes. Has Bowman ever heard of 3 point lighting? Elektra is a failure on almost every conceivable level.
1,Rotten,"Why, you might ask, is master director Chen Kaige wasting his time on such trashy material?"
1,Rotten,"If writer-director Vincenzo Natali, storyboard artist for Keanu Reeve's Johnny Mnemonic, were as comfortable with dialogue and dramatizing characters as he is with images, this first feature of his might have worked better."

0,Fresh,"Fascinating and horrifying, especially if you take a step back and view it thinking about what it tells us about the society in which these abuses took place."
1,Rotten,"Mary Shelley never soars the way the film so clearly wants to, though. It's hard to invest in the movie's core relationship when it becomes clear just what an uncompromising and unsympathetic figure Percy Shelley is."
0,Fresh,"The conversion between mediums is flawless, as it gains a variety of story expanding tricks this time around that can only come with the visual format."
1,Rotten,"Instead of a grandly ghoulish dash for survival, the movie revels in ghastly behavior with a mouthbreathing concentration that's as irritating as it is worthless."
0,Fresh,"Noah's Arc: Jumping the Broom comes off as feel-good, nothing-better-to-do-on-Saturday night light entertainment, and little more. It's easily digestible, but just as easily forgotten."
0,Fresh,"While brisk, informative, and entertaining, feels frustratingly sketchy."
1,Rotten,A high-school production of a second-rate Greek tragedian.
0,Fresh,"If someone makes a Mr. Belvedere movie, I'm may quit this gig. It's not that The A-Team is a terrible movie - it's not bad - but Hollywood's collective creative rut has studios raiding the '80s like an unguarded freezer overflowing with Pudd"

0,Fresh,"Robert Downey, Jr. is an unusually good leading man ... and has great comic timing in this movie."
1,Rotten,"File under interesting failure, although with three Oscar nominations (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Costume), there must surely be people out there somewhere convinced by this relentlessly tasteful affair."
1,Rotten,"There is such a chasm between the unreadable character we see and the extraordinary grisliness of Dahmer's crimes that this depiction is as helpful as those inevitable attributions of mass murderers as ""quiet, normal-seeming"" men from shocked neighbors."

1,Rotten,"The Family is filled with Besson's signature visual wit, boasting occasionally sharp satire aimed equally at both sides of the Atlantic, but he lets us down in the end through the deadly combination of broad characters and a rambling narrative."

0,Fresh,The luscious red orb in Flight of the Red Balloon is as much a reminder of the precariousness of life as an emblem of innocence.
0,Fresh,Colm Meaney commands our sympathy; Coogan gets the guilty laughs. It's all very English in its recognition of the mean smallness of so much of British life.
1,Rotten,It's less of a tribute to Salinger than to the guy in your MFA who wouldn't know a realistic woman character if she was staring them in the face.
0,Fresh,"The final result is such a deftly understated mixture of humour and sadness that it's only after the storm, when the end credits roll, that you really feel its full emotional force."
0,Fresh,"It is still a bit wimpy and sugary, but it's definitely entertaining, and the translation to American accelerates the tempo refreshingly."
0,Fresh,It's what a stoner comedy should be. It's what a buddy comedy should be. Two for the price of one sure as hell ain't bad . . . the funniest thing I've seen in months.
0,Fresh,"It's a touching, intimate film conducted mainly in Yiddish, and while the culture is particular, the human problems are universal."
0,Fresh,"Another frothy frappé from the ingenious French auteur Jean-Pierre Jeunet, this one pitting his beleaguered Everyman against avaricious arms dealers in a Paris more beguiling than the actual city."
0,Fresh,Whannell the screenwriter still has some catching up to do with Whannell the director. But his spiffy remake is mostly able to sustain that sweet spot between cheap thrills and sobering drama.
1,Rotten,"If David Lynch's Eraserhead were transported to bleakest Norfolk, you might end up with something as uncomfortable to watch as Possum."
1,Rotten,"The final chapter in Mehta's feminist trilogy (Fire, Earth), is, alas, the weakest."
0,Fresh,"A drama about mothers that comes from deep inside the author, in the most delicate and sensible way. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"This is a trip where you will likely find yourself asking, 'Are we there yet?'"
0,Fresh,"If you're thinking you don't want to see another AIDS documentary, please keep in mind that this isn't anything harrowing or self-important. It's really Rocky's story, and it's a truly amazing story of selflessness and heroism."
0,Fresh,"""Raw"" will be a difficult movie for many viewers. For those who can stomach it, however, it is rewarding - and certainly unforgettable."
0,Fresh,Julius Avery wrote and directed with an eye toward a fast pace and grim atmospherics.
1,Rotten,"What plays on screen is a caricature of the franchise, a film so loathe to have its own identity that it forgets everything that made previous installments must-see cinema."
1,Rotten,"For starters, it's just plain goofy."
0,Fresh,"This is a handsome, intriguing and subtly funny character study that almost leads to enlightenment."
0,Fresh,Seung-wan's The Berlin File is evidence of a visual master working with a budget that allows him some breathing room for some choice sequences.
0,Fresh,If Kingsglaive were just an above average action movie with a smooth script it would still impress but the humanity of its principal characters also raises Square-Enix's film.
1,Rotten,Slow and pretty and essentially unsatisfying.
1,Rotten,"In the end, the movie's a clever idea and not much more."
1,Rotten,"It's all indifferently acted, sloppily directed and edited, and utterly ridiculous."
0,Fresh,"Mockingjay - Part 1 is just big enough of a story that, even as a two-parter, the film feels substantial and justifiably halved. There's simply too much to digest as all the pieces are put into place and the real games are set to begin."
1,Rotten,A slight tale whose self-conscious indie quirks fail to lift it beyond familiar Disease of the Week formula.
1,Rotten,Eye-candy and grand events with no real substance.
0,Fresh,"An intelligent piece of dialogue about sex, love, obsession, conformity and simple carnal merchandise. [Full review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"Never have the stakes seemed so low for everyone involved. This is a sterile high school environment, lacking anything nearing controversy."
1,Rotten,"The film's semi-slow pacing, lack of urgency and generally anti-climactic premise take its toll in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long."
1,Rotten,"""Sarah's Key,"" based on the novel by Tatiana de Rosnay, struggles with a problem it never overcomes: How do you make viewers care about everyday problems when juxtaposed with the horror of the Holocaust?"
0,Fresh,"The movie's thrill-and-chill sequences are nasty and suspenseful, though once the creatures start to attack, the scenes get repetitive."
0,Fresh,A marvelous but bleak psychological Western.
1,Rotten,Funny? Yes. But is revolting raunch really a step forward for women in Hollywood?
0,Fresh,"Beneath the feathered toupee, that disturbingly fuzzy mustache, and 30 pounds of listless, desk-job body fat lies Matt Damon, giving an outstanding comedic performance."
0,Fresh,"While there's really not much new here (aside from playing in a sport that rarely gets the time of day in Hollywood) 'McFarland, USA' hits enough of a decent stride (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
1,Rotten,"... has trouble keeping its disparate elements together, although there are some touching character-driven moments along the way."
1,Rotten,Evolution? Not quite.
0,Fresh,"The main characters' desires are so deeply submerged, hidden not only from each other than from themselves, that it's a shock when even the tiniest, most tentative endearment is expressed."
0,Fresh,McAvoy is masterful in his role as he takes on nine different characters all rolled into one heaping mess of a human being.
0,Fresh,Mean Girls does the 'wicked teen girl movie' subgenre justice.
0,Fresh,"[A] heightened, brightened, skip-a-dee-doo-dah glide through one of life's big goalposts: not so much growing up but growing out. And I don't mean bellywise, either..."
1,Rotten,Nicole's father steps too far out of congressional character ... exposing a quickly sketched plot about dysfunctional families and cracking the film's sexy MTV veneer.
0,Fresh,"This superb satire became the standard against which all mockumentaries are evaluated. The film was so successful that the fictitious group reunited for a series of live concerts and a TV special, further blurring the line between real and reel."
0,Fresh,"There is fun to be had here-not as much as there could be, but it kept me entertained, faults and all."
0,Fresh,"Hellboy II is still very entertaining, even if it is simultaneously a little lackluster, and fans of the original are sure to like it. It probably won't hold up well on repeat viewings though."
1,Rotten,As soapy as it ever was.
0,Fresh,turns out to be an exciting thriller despite the fact that it's just a desperate woman talking on the phone to a random stranger
0,Fresh,"Danny Collins is the cinematic equivalent of a well-sung easy rock tune, enjoyably light and bouncy, with some darker notes hidden within the chords."
0,Fresh,"[W]hen a filmmaker uses the limitations to their advantage to create an incredible blend of action, comedy and dark twisted humour that rivals that of any big studio production, you have one hell of a film on your hands."
0,Fresh,A stone-solid thriller.
0,Fresh,"The drama in its story is put before its horror ingredients, making it one of the best films around. It's a psychological horror film with captivating social commentary."
0,Fresh,"Seemingly simple and straightforward upon first glance, the handsome period Western blossoms considerably into a profound nostalgic experience."
0,Fresh,"""Fences"" wraps you and whirls you in a heady cyclone of words, ultimately dropping you gently on the ground, moved and changed and unexpectedly uplifted by the journey."
0,Fresh,"True to its title, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" generates more than its share of heat, even if it never truly becomes an engulfing flame."
0,Fresh,A gonzo LOL/WTF of a splatter thriller.
0,Fresh,"Entertaining, the movie equivalent of a summer read -- a manipulative, over-reaching page-turner that'll be long forgotten by summer's end."
1,Rotten,"As I took off my gray-lensed 3-D spectacles at the end of Monsters vs. Aliens, I felt not so much immersed as fuzzy with exhaustion."
0,Fresh,Girl-powered sports film is predictable but sweet.
0,Fresh,"Truth boasts another juggernaut by Cate Blanchett that is buoyed by an incredibly strong adaptation of [Mary] Mapes' book, eliciting all the intricate minutiae and ethics of not only investigative journalism but the absurdity of corporate blinders."
0,Fresh,"The storyline borrows heavily from familiar modern mythologies, but Snyders gorgeous visuals, the soaring animation and some fierce battle scenes raise the excitement level."
1,Rotten,"When in Rome is even worse than this year's first romantic comedy offering, Leap Year."
0,Fresh,There's a timelessness to Spring that's enchanting.
0,Fresh,"Though the script's characterization of Sierra is at times uneven, Purser figures out her mix of confidence and insecurity."
1,Rotten,A working concept. A wrongfully constructed movie. An overlong comedy about ignorant superheroes. [Full review in Spanish].
0,Fresh,"What The Rock does best is pay homage to some of the classic, if not well-worn, films and themes to emerge from Hollywood in the last three decades."
0,Fresh,"Certainly there's little here to detain Michael Bay fans, but anyone who appreciates bone-dry deadpan humour and intelligently subversive film-making will find plenty to raise their interest - if not their adrenaline level."
1,Rotten,The first major release of the year is a complete dud. Shocker!
0,Fresh,"DeNiro's days as a dramatic lead are history, but he still has a future in comedy. Catherine Keener, however, is the best thing in this movie."
0,Fresh,A pleasant enough diversion for anyone who likes their comedies as light and fluffy as their popcorn.
0,Fresh,It's hard to imagine a more efficient way to lend flesh and blood to the remembrance of that night.
0,Fresh,An enjoyable sequel.
0,Fresh,"Whether it's ""Alex Rider,"" ""Agent Cody Banks"" or ""Spy Kids,"" plenty have tried to adapt the 007 shtick to younger characters, with demonstrably dopey results. In the end, the reason it works for Vaughn is that he's making the film for adults."
0,Fresh,2014 is proving to be the year that faith-based cinema is breaking out of its credible indie vibe and sweeping into wide release mode.
0,Fresh,It's one of the year's essential releases - maybe its most essential.
0,Fresh,"Isaac, a talented musician in his own right, inhabits the role so fully and believably you expect Davis to pop out of the screen cap in hand for a few pennies after a song."
0,Fresh,"It is, perhaps, the ultimate proof that a ridiculous movie and a good movie aren't mutually exclusive."
0,Fresh,"The actual physical locations in Far From Men are stunning, and Oelhoffen smartly emphasizes the emptiness of the desert, which seems to stretch on infinitely behind the characters."
1,Rotten,What is the target audience for this particular brand of cotton candy? Teenage girls dreaming of first love while sipping cherry pop?
0,Fresh,"Life sucks, people are awful, we're all going to die, and good riddance. Who says Lars von Trier doesn't like happy endings?"
0,Fresh,Finds just the right balance between goofy teenage antics and full-blown nightmare fuel to delight fans both young and old.
1,Rotten,One suspects the perpetrators of this cinematic crime spent Valentine's Day alone.
0,Fresh,Joker has two scenes that are absolutely brilliant.
0,Fresh,"Predestination just wants to blow minds. But in its best moments, the ones that put Snook front and center, it threatens to break hearts instead."
0,Fresh,"...unlike so many deconstructions of the Hollywood dream that show the darkness beneath, Starlet does that and still lets us keep dreaming in the best way."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, ""Thank You For Your Service"" is commendable and well, serviceable. But it's more of an honorable discharge rather than something you fete with medals of esteem."
0,Fresh,"The script by Bruce A. Evans, who also directed, and writing partner Raynold Gideon is unusually complex and dense with narrative and character nuances, with such surprises around every corner that we can't wait to see where the next clue is going to lead"
0,Fresh,"Moments of weirdness are spread throughout, yet they don't distract from the overall emotional and visual impact of Youth, a film that's funny in some parts, touching in others, and captivating as a whole."
1,Rotten,It is willing to attempt some thematic complexity and it has reliably solid performances. But it does not address its themes with enough depth to justify its darkness.
1,Rotten,"An unbearable 90-minute trip with a trio of loud, needy egotists-one whose updated scenario never feels like it needs the extra 75 minutes."
1,Rotten,"Nava ... evidently couldn't decide whether to play scenes straight or comedically, as he mixes some highly inappropriate humorous scenes with more seriously dramatic ones."
0,Fresh,"Adam McKay's film gets the points across but it's a cool, distant experience resulting in a sharp, cut and dried list of bad deeds by a deeply flawed man."
0,Fresh,"One of the great talents of the Safdies is to show you New York from the inside. With their films you always feel like you're getting the worm's-eye view, an underground tour of where stuff actually happens."
0,Fresh,"Sad, mournful and devastating, Ikiru is one of Kurosawa's most impressive achievements"
0,Fresh,Eastwood's longtime lenser Jack Green makes a decent feature debut with a well-acted comedy-adventure that in its good moments recalls such classics as The Sting and The Grifters.
0,Fresh,"An unusual, oddly satisfying film that's part road movie and part emotional drama."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, though, the latest documentary overreaches to make Houston's life and death about something bigger, in a way that at times feels as strained as some of the notes during that aforementioned comeback."
0,Fresh,"Rock-bottom expectations are rewarded, sort of, in this update of Hanna-Barbera's necktied ursus."
1,Rotten,Mansome is a mullet ... neither all-out funny nor seriously thought-provoking. To mangle that famous quote by Gertrude Stein: 'There is no hair there.'
1,Rotten,The Boss Baby is a full-length version of a parody trailer straight out of Tropic Thunder.
1,Rotten,"It's animated fluff, separated from the eye-candy you see on the Cartoon Network only in its length and high production values."
0,Fresh,"A three-alarm, three-hanky movie of the highest order, perfect for your kids who don't get to see many truly sad films."
0,Fresh,Spike Lee always manages to inject political commentary into very clever moments.
0,Fresh,"As a full-length cartoon, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is drawn out - but in a good way."
0,Fresh,"Sit back, relax and enjoy this unpatronising, entertaining and utterly filthy movie."
0,Fresh,"Underrated, fascinating musical starring Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters."
1,Rotten,A bundle of chaotic energy signifying nothing.
0,Fresh,"A delightfully fun and magical fantasy film, the likes of which hasn't been seen since the first Pirates or Lord of the Rings."
1,Rotten,"Everyone involved in this film might want to reflect that Nazi medical experimentation during the second world war did in fact happen, under circumstances other than these."
0,Fresh,Sweet and loopy.
0,Fresh,Again James Wan has given us a remarkable horror film that once more exemplifies why he's at the forefront of modern horror.
1,Rotten,Only dedicated fans will be willing to overlook Paycheck's relatively weak cast and lackluster fights and chases.
1,Rotten,"The Big Bounce has many of the same problems as The Big Sleep, but few of its strengths."
0,Fresh,"The result is a heart-tugger made totally irresistible because of the combination of Kitano's wry, sly sense of humor and his rigorous detachment."
1,Rotten,The demon-haunted West Virginia town still gives the creeps... but this belated sequel proves to be only fitfully exciting and scary - mostly because the action stops every few minutes for yet another character to deliver reams of boring exposition.
0,Fresh,"Feels more like a ""real"" Tim Burton movie than most of his recent live-action ones."
0,Fresh,"Imperfect and overlong, but hugely ambitious and often breathtaking."
0,Fresh,Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has plot holes wide enough to drive a tank through. The filmmakers obviously feel that most viewers will be too busy watching the onscreen artillery to notice. They are probably right.
0,Fresh,"Despite it's shortcomings, Lizzie fans will love The Lizzie McGuire Movie."
1,Rotten,"""Just Wright"" is, I'm sorry to say, just wrong."
1,Rotten,"Gets better as it goes along, although I was never rolling on the floor with laughter."
0,Fresh,"The humility and devotion of the heroes cannot help but move us and, I hope, inspire us to treasure the masterworks they saved and the heroes who saved them."
0,Fresh,Amiable if rather toothless fable.
0,Fresh,"It's dark fun, in the spirit of ""Gremlins."""
0,Fresh,"Annabelle Comes Home is the best Conjuring spinoff movie, which is damning with faint praise."
1,Rotten,"""Goodbye Lover"" is a gum-chewing mess. And that's WAY before Ellen DeGeneres shows up."
1,Rotten,"Everything Streep does here is a seismic act of theater. If she so much as tilts her head, the earth tilts with it. She doesn't simply overwhelm this thin historic biography - and the other actors around her - she detonates it."
0,Fresh,Scream is so hip and irreverent that you almost forget it's a slasher movie. Almost.
1,Rotten,"He's got eight kids, she's got 10 and Yours, Mine & Ours is completely by the numbers."
0,Fresh,"A slick, suspenseful and stomach-churning sci-fi thriller, Life is the perfect Alien movie right now for those getting all twitchy waiting for the next Alien movie."
0,Fresh,"First-time director Greg Coolidge packs his cast with quirky bit players, crisp physical humor that doesn't involve dented noggins and more than a few references that require you to think."
0,Fresh,Hill shows his caution sometimes comically but also with preciousness in how he handles Na-Kel Smith's Ray.
1,Rotten,"Resides amid half-remembered fragments of Cinemax soft-core, Turkish remakes of The Exorcist, and third-string Troma releases such as Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid."
0,Fresh,"Hulk will almost certainly disappoint its target audience but it's still the most beautiful, intelligent blockbuster of the year."
1,Rotten,"Noisy, forced and much less magical than Nanny McPhee I."
1,Rotten,"A script so larded up with consciousness-raising claptrap and milky, synthesized epiphanies, there's no way you can stomach it."
1,Rotten,Relentlessly juvenile and awash in stereotypes.
0,Fresh,"Wicki brings a tremendous sense of confidence to the project, letting the details of life on the home front heighten the tragedy to come."
0,Fresh,Videodrome operates as a study in metaphysics; it draws attention to its medium and in doing so cleverly violates its fiction.
0,Fresh,"Richly entertaining and blackly funny but told with sincerity and heart, the half-dozen Western tales packed into The Ballad of Buster Scruggs show the Coen brothers loading up their six-shooter and firing barely a blank."
0,Fresh,Renoir is a sensitive and serene sanctuary of beauty.
0,Fresh,A character study that offers some of Steve Coogan's most interesting work and another testament to Michael Winterbottom's knack for period naturalism.
0,Fresh,"Wall-to-wall action, a well-developed lead villain, and some legitimately funny moments, as a celebration of 10 years of the MCU, this is a real blast."
1,Rotten,"These moments give flavor, but fail to cohere into any particular taste."
0,Fresh,A clever concept and stylish execution (in both senses) aren't quite enough to make this achingly meta remake/reboot/sequel stand out from the slasher pack.
0,Fresh,"Stuffed to the gills with child abduction, overmedicated depression and familial implosions, director Denis Villeneuve's bloated whodunit is a puppy suicide away from the most joyless way to spend well over two hours."
0,Fresh,"Without the intrusion of voice-overs or interviews, Mylan and Shenk attained a remarkable intimacy with the strapping, earnest, startlingly beautiful teenagers."
0,Fresh,"Revisiting his interest in oblique comedy, Jarmusch explores a primal relationship, that of a passenger and taxi driver, using the cab as a temporary shared world, from which one party may emerge shaken up or feeling differently about himself/herself"
0,Fresh,"The casting is fine, even though I had expected Franco to give his actress-wife Brie a meatier role than a stuffy goody-two-shoes spouse."
0,Fresh,"The movie doesn't quite extract blood, sweat, or tears, even if it does toil."
0,Fresh,"It's a tour de force for Norton, who fills the air with an intense and yet thoughtful patter about why Stone is in the joint, what he did, what he doesn't want to think about/talk about any more and what he thinks Jack Mabry wants to hear."
0,Fresh,A teen romance that generates enough honest emotion to play against the predictability of its finish.
0,Fresh,Sarah Gadon is the heart of this historical comedy with great production values. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,Heavy sigh. So many potential puns. So little space.
0,Fresh,"It may well be the greatest film ever made about slavery, but that says more about the movie world than the work itself."
1,Rotten,does away with any of the cautionary edge the first adaptation had and replaces it with silly humor
1,Rotten,They say Sanctum was inspired by true events. I can only hope the people in the true event died so they avoid the torture of seeing their story portrayed this way on screen.
1,Rotten,Tangled plot ties up this talented cast.
1,Rotten,"Sensual but profoundly silly, Silk is ultimately little more than softcore porn with arthouse trappings, a moony, dopily romantic Red Shoe Diaries variation for the NPR set."
0,Fresh,"gets completely under your skin, rattles your sense of what's right and wrong, and generally undercuts any kind of moral pretense we might bring into the theater"
0,Fresh,"Bottom line: with Murray on fire and enough clever dialogue to rival its predecessor, Ghostbusters II is good enough to put post-milennial comedy to shame."
1,Rotten,It's only as the narrative adopts an increasingly episodic feel that one's interest begins to wane...
1,Rotten,"It has moments of sweetness, and moments of hilarious comedy; but when it comes down to it, the tendency to use gross-out tactics makes it hardly worth sitting through."
1,Rotten,A disposable film.
1,Rotten,"I know Monster-in-Law is just a slapstick comedy, but is it too much to expect the characters to exhibit routine intelligence?"
1,Rotten,"As the movie limps on, it becomes painfully obvious that both these 'creatures' ... will always remain victims at best, stooges at worst."
0,Fresh,[Tyler Perry's Wesley] is Prince Charming for a prospective audience of women who are less enchanted by rippling abs than by kindness and responsibility.
1,Rotten,Oh boy does this movie have problems. From its wall-to-wall electronica score to the blandly executed sex scenes.
0,Fresh,Lively and mostly successful treatment -- at least until the barbs are blunted in the messy third act.
0,Fresh,"It may not include every nuance of the graphic novel, but it captures as much as any adaptation could -- which may not satisfy the fanboys, but it's probably more than enough for everyone else."
0,Fresh,"Intense and intriguing, it's an action-packed techno-thriller that makes you think."
0,Fresh,"Set aside that disconcerting observation, if you can, and the film is a minor gem of nuanced performances and sublime directorial craftsmanship."
1,Rotten,"The film's slow pacing... detracts from and defuses what is in other respects, one of the more interesting screen imaginations at work today."
0,Fresh,"To say The Invisible Man is satisfying seems inadequate; there's something glorious about the film's conclusion, which may feel to some men every bit as horrific as the implications of Florence Pugh's facial expression in the final shot of Midsommar."
0,Fresh,"The plot is ridiculous and full of holes, but never pretends to be otherwise."
0,Fresh,"at its best plays as a powerful, deeply human reminder of how desperate we can be for connection, however compromised it may be"
0,Fresh,"The movie's real strength is Gaby Dellal's careful, subtle direction. She avoids the pitfalls of melodrama and histrionics that often plague movies about loss, keeping her actors' emotions grounded in recognizable truth."
0,Fresh,Director Akin's film is insanely heavy and completely free of the redemptive happy ending nonsense so common among Hollywood films.
0,Fresh,"Eastwood's most optimistic film, narrated with an astonishing skill and has a great cast. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"Elaborately aggressive and provocative, Crank is just what its title suggests: fast, ornery, and exhausting."
1,Rotten,"Doesn't offer much beyond the rather depressing realization that, in today's screens, progressive sexual politics boil down to making a gay family's dysfunction as hackneyed as a straight family's"
1,Rotten,"This film has no direction or redeeming qualities other than being offensive, aimless, and having its young black female leads all dressed up in silly garb with no place to go. B.A.P.S: Beware of Asinine Picture that Stinks!!!"
0,Fresh,"I can't think of a better onscreen depiction of the feeling of being forsaken and forgotten by the ultimate clique - parents - than the one in writer/director Jennifer Westfeldt's bright, quick-witted Friends with Kids."
1,Rotten,The lack of any real artistic commitment on the part of its subject ultimately raises the question of why we need a film about Darin in the first place.
0,Fresh,"A salty, mildly amusing, slapstick comedy that's filled with scrappy banter."
1,Rotten,It managed to take what started out as an interesting franchise and ruin it.
0,Fresh,"Far From Home is a home run. It signs off on one Marvel era, sets up the next and a sequel can't come soon enough."
1,Rotten,You can just about feel the imbecility rising.
0,Fresh,Fun summer blockbuster
0,Fresh,"A classy take on the often trashy pregnancy horror category, with a subtle social critique underlying its neo-gothic texture."
0,Fresh,"Expertly acted throughout, this remains a definitive snapshot of British life in the 1980s."
0,Fresh,"A bit overlong and quite bloody for a brainless action movie, but it is generally fun to watch."
0,Fresh,proves it's not necessarily 'game over' for the video-game movie genre.
1,Rotten,"Voices is more a prose poem than a film, a moody exercise devoid of suspense and interactions that spark us to care."
0,Fresh,"Not a 'great' film per se, but definitely a worthwhile telling of a heartwarmingly Disney, sports-themed tale."
1,Rotten,"The film leaves you feeling as though you've watched a movie thrice its running time. Crowe, the director, knows what he wants... and what he wants, apparently, is everything. It's too much."
0,Fresh,Broken Flowers overcomes its shortcomings through Murray's ability to make a nearly nihilistic character human.
1,Rotten,"Tells a tale we've heard hundreds of times before, yet pretends it will surprise us. It doesn't."
1,Rotten,The movie never transcended its elaborate production work to achieve an independent reality. It's simply pictures of what never happened.
1,Rotten,"When you find out at the end that what you've just seen is merely the overture to yet another sequel, you can't help wondering what more can be extracted from this franchise. Gold, me hearties, more gold!"
0,Fresh,"Turns genre conventions on their head in creating a thoroughly engrossing mixture of murder mystery, psychological thriller and very black comedy."
1,Rotten,I Am Legend simply sucks but that's putting it a little too mildly when the last man on earth is liable to skip over it in favor of I Am Sam.
1,Rotten,[The movie] suffers both from repetition and the erroneous belief that we want to spend so much time with the protagonist...
1,Rotten,Fails to live up to the promise of its premise.
0,Fresh,Binder's writing is matched by the top-notch talents on display here.
1,Rotten,"The distinction between actors and special effects shrinks ever further in the video game-turned-horror film Silent Hill: Revelation 3D, which reduces its human players to plastic action figures in tired genre settings."
0,Fresh,"An off-beat, hair-brained, and weird spoof of a horrible science fiction flick."
0,Fresh,"For true believers, ""Neil Young Journeys"" is a visit with a still-vital friend. For the merely curious, it's proof that there's more to the man - more strangeness, deeper communions with the muse - than classic rock radio will ever let on."
0,Fresh,"You might balk at the over-simplification of the original's complex morality and shocking violence. In the same breath, you're just as likely to applaud the wise decision to carefully reconstruct the source material's most iconic, unforgettable moments."
1,Rotten,"The universe of the Marvel studios can be easily followed, but it begins to get too close in itself, losing the naturalness of the independent stories. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,The film establishes a verit intimacy that is often little interested in acknowledging the rigidity of the documentary/fiction divide.

0,Fresh,"Interesting, downbeat directorial debut by Michael Keaton marred by a needlessly ambiguous ending."
0,Fresh,"Like most winning comedies, Tag finds unique, plausibly human quirks for its major characters, and puts them in situations where they cannot help but act on them."
0,Fresh,"Despite its genre underpinnings and uneasy visual style meant to disorient us, She Dies Tomorrow holds an inspiring sense of hope."
0,Fresh,"""T2 Trainspotting"" is mostly a character study of damaged people trying to reconcile their troubled pasts and find a motivation to move forward."
1,Rotten,Unpretentiously dumb.
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, what the film is emblematic of is the Hollywood's utter detachment from the real world and actual current events."
0,Fresh,"Just as I'd reserved myself to the notion that Robert De Niro would coast through the rest of his career, he turns in one of the year's most powerful performances."
0,Fresh,"Fans of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle will find much to enjoy. Though it has its flaws, you can't deny how much fun The Next Level is."
0,Fresh,Mr. Pacino's portrait of Spector is stunning in its guile and vitality.
0,Fresh,"It comes as a pleasing jolt to find the youngster, Goldie Hawn, at the apex of the triangle, not only beautifully holding her own with the two veteran stars but also enhancing the content and flavor of the movie."
0,Fresh,"Shyamalan's sense of pace, atmosphere, and mood remains near-flawless."
0,Fresh,"Director Fuqua, Mr. Washington, Mr. Hawke and the rest prove that there's nothing wrong with the urban-crime genre that a little energy can't cure."
1,Rotten,[Perry] squanders his most impressive cast yet on one of his least compelling stories.
0,Fresh,"While its portrayal of the country that it calls home is not strictly authentic, the movie has an element of human truth that carries it over the line."
1,Rotten,At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd. But it would be better to wait for the video. And a very rainy day.
0,Fresh,Alfonso Cuarón's Roma is a magical film that weaves memories of a childhood as idyllic as it is raw... in a world where silences prevail in homes accompanied by the endless murmurs and din of the streets. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad -- MOVIE."
0,Fresh,It's a full-blown method-style performance. We don't question its authenticity for a moment.
0,Fresh,Clever and exuberant to the point of being obnoxious.
1,Rotten,Its strong suit is visual panache. It's too bad that consistent comedy and emotional resonance get lost amid the dust and cacti.
1,Rotten,A movie in which the most nuanced performance is given by a body part has real problems.
0,Fresh,"Fast-paced and colourful, this documentary chronicles the astonishing story of a gifted artist who never found the success everyone knew he deserved."
1,Rotten,"Emboldened by its indie-film trappings and the easily manipulated cheers of its festival-circuit audience, it luxuriates in and celebrates pointless violence and aimless vengeance. It's Taxi Driver as feel-good movie."

0,Fresh,"What's missing from La Llorona is the element of world-building, the mapping of the myth onto the wider world in some more explicit and ample form than a mere sudden apparition."
1,Rotten,"Bay is the most dangerous of directors, a hack who believes himself an auteur."
0,Fresh,"""The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution"" arrives on PBS stations early next year. I suggest not waiting."
0,Fresh,"Yes, it's painful, but Snow Angels is so full of rich performances and characterizations that even gunshots can't kill its power."
1,Rotten,Danes' performance is a grace note in a movie that is otherwise misguided. The adaptation of Martin's bestselling novella lacks the flow and depth of its source material.
0,Fresh,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a typical movie from the Marvel Universe: a lot of jokes -- some of them work and others don't -- very attractive and entertaining, but nothing more. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,THE MULE is one of the worst films of the year. It's nothing more than a vehicle for Eastwood to have a good time singing and cavorting with much younger women.
0,Fresh,"Decent enough--fast-moving, colorful and energetic--but it's hardly an instant classic."
0,Fresh,presents a consistently fascinating and highly entertaining portrait of the mechanics of power and how the worst human impulses all too often function as the grease that keeps them churning
0,Fresh,"The film shows us the landscape of modern warfare, which when it is men with guns facing each other is pretty much the way war has been in the trenches since the Civil War."
0,Fresh,The horror flick Saw started a chain-Saw of sequels and that is now one of the most successful of the chop-and-slash variety. It's not a bad way to spend a Halloween evening.

0,Fresh,A powerful film with powerful performances.
1,Rotten,"Given how rough-and-tumble Jeff's prior existence seems, will leave a skeptical audience wondering how long this happy ending can possibly last."
0,Fresh,"But perhaps by shining some light into this intergenerational darkness, Macdonald's film will help other suffering children, even in the homes of the rich and extremely famous."
1,Rotten,"It feels like a slicker, sleeker version of the cruddy DV odysseys of yore, and yet at its (mumble) core, it's just more of the same minor-key doodling."
0,Fresh,"The Good Dinosaur is gorgeous, but flawed."
0,Fresh,One of those imperfect films that's nevertheless more intriguing than conventionally stronger but less challenging ones.

1,Rotten,"Though there are some funny moments, little in Red, White and Blonde is enjoyable."
1,Rotten,"Poor Cuba Gooding. As if it were not humiliating enough to play a guy so clumsy that he can't walk in the snow without pratfalling, he also has to do jokes about being a black man in the Great White North."
0,Fresh,"That childlike spirit, of loving a movie so much you have to just become it, pulses through their 'Raiders' adaptation, and through much of the documentary as well."
1,Rotten,"For most people, 15 minutes worth of impressive annihilation won't be worth enduring an hour and a half of dramatic monotony."
0,Fresh,A well-intentioned true story of hope and justice that is well-acted enough to overcome its weaknesses.
1,Rotten,"Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well. Their film falters, however, in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy, a salute that I'd hoped the movie would avoid."
0,Fresh,"Visually, Predator is a full-assault experience. Director John McTiernan mixes his range of shots with fast precision and full-blast effect."
1,Rotten,"[The film] tirelessly plumbs away for laughs, some honestly earned, with the majority on the desperate side."
0,Fresh,"It's a movie that's meant to entertain, and does, but just cannot rise above being enjoyable in the moment."

1,Rotten,Typically kind-hearted but mawkish tale...formulaically inspiring fare.
0,Fresh,"Whether in trying to reach out for a wider audience here she has diluted her talent in favour of a richer, more stylish surface is a matter for argument. The smoother this kind of film gets, the easier it is to think it."
0,Fresh,"Azkaban is a great adventure, a work that's marvelous as part of the franchise and on its own."
0,Fresh,"Zany, manic, and heartwarming. While younger kids might need a few explanations, the movie is generally family friendly and a good time for all."
1,Rotten,"Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel apparently couldn't resist dressing the movie up like a Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake with lots of precious, cutesy comic touches."
0,Fresh,"Williams's low-key, heartbreaking turn speaks volumes about the economic savagery of modern America, where even the companionship of a pet has a price beyond some people's means."
1,Rotten,"a cloying mess crying for another rewrite, or maybe just the quick mercy of being plunked into the nearest trash can"
0,Fresh,A very sensitive and humane story with outstanding performances by Dave Johns and Hayley Squires. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,"By referencing horror masters Dario Argento and Wes Craven, the film invites comparison to much better movies, [with] none of Argento's style or Craven's savagely sardonic of sense of humor."
0,Fresh,"I'm breaking my rating scale for this one as this is the kind of crazy ambitious film that should be impossible to make this captivating, spectacular and memorable."
1,Rotten,"[D]espite the movie's solid performances and permeating aura of melancholy, it never quite comes together..."
0,Fresh,Events never transpire as one would expect from a more conventional thriller.
0,Fresh,"Maggie's plan may or may not work out. But as a smart, perceptive commentary on modern times, ""Maggie's Plan"" succeeds beautifully."
1,Rotten,"Family-friendly premise notwithstanding, this seemingly innocuous fare scarcely hides the contempt most studio executives must harbor for their audiences."
1,Rotten,"There's still a disconnect between the stories that is never resolved. Even the movie's conclusion is ambiguous, providing few answers to even the biggest questions."
1,Rotten,It plays like a movie dreamed up by people in a studio marketing department who'd decided to bare their souls.
1,Rotten,"The approach is creative, but it still does not overcome the problems of bringing such a contemplative novel to the screen."
1,Rotten,"All shtick and repetition, something the little ones may find entertaining, but something that will drive parents 2 boredom, 2 another theater, or 2 ask for their money back."

0,Fresh,"It is fresh and insightful, and it is visceral cinema."
1,Rotten,"Shot-Caller is more of a kissin' cousin to Napoleon Dynamite, with delayed, deadpan performance beats that crackle with dried irony and deliberate oddity, performed by a cast of amateurs."

1,Rotten,It's a long ride.
1,Rotten,"Gregory Peck stays beautifully within the character of the bespectacled, widowed man, but with its episodes unevenly joined, the script is too repetitive and long."

0,Fresh,"The film is mildly diverting, with Garner doing a good pass at being a 13-year-old in an adult's body."
0,Fresh,"There's something about the solemn, gloomy, often overwhelmingly powerful experience of watching Melancholia. I'll give it this much: This is a hard movie to forget."
1,Rotten,"Put Happy Death Day 2U together with its predecessor, Happy Death Day, and you could easily call the pair Dumb and Dumber."

0,Fresh,a beautifully mounted adventure movie that adheres almost fetishistically to its source material
1,Rotten,Saving Mr. Banks depicts cinema as a perverse nexus of capitalism and psychoanalysis.
0,Fresh,"You know how you go see a film that's been hyped up the butt and no matter how good it is, it's never as good as you expected? Trash that theory. No matter how hyped this movie becomes, you'll enjoy it immensely."

1,Rotten,Everything produced by the Duplass Brothers is hollow and superficial and cutesy. Their examinations of the bourgeoisie lack depth and flatter their audience...

0,Fresh,Pegg and Wright brilliantly send up both the zombie genre and British society by showing how mindless everyday life is--there are zombies all around us!
0,Fresh,"The talking animals, a seamless combination of special effects and puppets, delighted the young audience at a preview I attended. Even the adults seemed to be having a good time with Dr. Dolittle 2."
1,Rotten,"Writer and co-director Kate Connor's debut feature ""Fort McCoy"" is an example of what happens when you try to shoehorn as many topics and themes from WWII as you can into one movie."
1,Rotten,"... all middle with no beginning -- and, of course, no end, so the franchise can go on."
0,Fresh,"This remarkable film from Australia, the debut feature of writer-director Cate Shortland, moves to the lyrical rhythms and unhurried pace of a 1970s road movie, or one of those Joni Mitchell ballads."
1,Rotten,Forget motion capture. This could have done with a bit of emotion capture.
0,Fresh,"It may not add up to a narrative, but it's a fascinating compilation -- a mixtape you may want to hear more than once."

0,Fresh,"I defy any animal lover not to tear up with Kumal and Sangha reunite, even if it is a little faux."
1,Rotten,"The 85-minute documentary takes a torpid, fly-on-the-wall approach, providing little context, few insights, and not enough music."
1,Rotten,"A bad taste frenzy, with cameras tied to the bellies of some beasts contained by crooks in a salt water lake."

0,Fresh,"Red isn't particularly deep -- yes, the characters know they're older than they once were, but that doesn't seem to stand in their way once they rev up. This does give the movie an extra little current of joy."
0,Fresh,"The lovely twilit moments in this movie stay with one, and that summoning them up in your mind is like slowing down time."
0,Fresh,"A tightly wound, explosive film that delivers more than is required."
0,Fresh,"Pitch-perfect performances by Shirley MacLaine and an unusually restrained Jack Black hold together this offbeat true-crime saga, but Linklater's keen eye for human eccentricity flowers most memorably on the periphery."

0,Fresh,"The style dazzles, evoking everything wonderful and terrible from film noir and combining it with a likable hero and wonderfully pulpy premise."
1,Rotten,A thief trapped in a house with a serial killer who collects and tortures nice families is all the preamble you will need to prepare for the terror that I hid from.
0,Fresh,"The film is ambitious visually, in spite of its small budget, and while not all of the effects come off, it's hard to hold that against an indie production like this."
1,Rotten,"Because the film doesn't know what story of Joan it wants to tell, it tries on too much so that in the end, we are left with little beyond spy-romance tropes."
0,Fresh,"To find comedy against the backdrop of the Palestine-Israeli conflict takes chutzpah... or alwaqaha, as they say in Arabic. It somehow maintains a genial tone, despite references to terrorism and daily humiliations of the occupation."

0,Fresh,"Kelly Reichardt's third film is another small story revolving around seemingly banal events which, like its predecessor Old Joy, builds into a moving cry of despair for its alienated lead character."
0,Fresh,"Long after I'd stopped thinking about the movie's central gimmick, Smith's performance still stuck with me."
0,Fresh,"City by the Sea would have been a TV movie-of-the-week without De Niro's name attached. That said, it's easily his most moving, nuanced performance in years."
0,Fresh,"There's a mellow dignity to it, as it takes a blunt, somber, sobering view of the looming apocalypse rather than checking off genre tropes every five minutes."
0,Fresh,"Gere's genial sleekness placed against Coogan's consternation and growing agitation... Coogan trembles with... resentment, a barely-stemmed incendiary force. These are terrible people; Moverman hopes to demonstrate why. Coogan and Gere deliver."

0,Fresh,"Conveys an unforgettable sense of all that's stolen when children are abused-as well as the heroic bravery, compassion and togetherness required to combat such cruelty."
0,Fresh,"Along with the amusing characters and straightforward plot, Logan Lucky is pure entertainment."
1,Rotten,"Southland may be ambitious in its genre-defying abandon, sideswiping science fiction, satire, film noir and melodrama along the way, but it's also exasperatingly convoluted, self-amused and politically sophomoric."
0,Fresh,"A tale of the end of an era, but one which uses smoke and mirrors at its heart"
1,Rotten,"The shtick is desperately crude and not particularly funny. One wonders why any actress, even a retired MTV game show hostess, would stoop to such a disgraceful gig."

0,Fresh,A very worthy close-out for his remarkable output of the last decade.
1,Rotten,"Muddled, dreary and preposterous."
0,Fresh,"Bale is good--solid amid the ongoing storm--but don't expect much of him. This is Sam Worthington's movie, and he steals it."
1,Rotten,"...screenwriter Angus MacLachlan seems to be trying to rewrite Equus without realizing that: 1) what works on stage does not necessarily work on screen, and 2) it's not the '70s anymore."
0,Fresh,Claire Denis' most conventionally entertaining film is a delight. And it's yet another reminder Juliette Binoche is an international treasure who should be cherished.
1,Rotten,"He speaks the truth much of the time, yet all the whipping back of the curtain ends up covering up other realities about movies and life."
0,Fresh,"I defended this film since it released its first trailer back in March. Here I am happily pointing at you through the screen and saying, 'I told you so.'"
1,Rotten,"It's easy to see why everyone involved wanted to tell this story, but with too many detours and a lost sense of tone, it's up to Theron to make the film seem smarter than it is."
1,Rotten,"The creative team here has ties to that Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones crowd, which may explain why so many of Ryan Reynolds's lines sound as if they might have been better delivered by a young Hugh Grant."
0,Fresh,"The 68-year-old filmmaker shows that he's at the peak of his skills, both as a visual artist and a storyteller."
0,Fresh,"Red Joan never meanders. This film is a smartly designed, tightly packaged tale of one woman's journey, the choices she makes along the way, and the far reverberating impact they had on history."

0,Fresh,"Stiller and Wilson's flirty, crackerjack rapport has grown to resemble something like a pan-sexual, THC-enhanced Abbott and Costello."
1,Rotten,"There are some decent laughs scattered throughout Due Date, but Phillips can't find a way to make his two leads likeable: they remain obnoxious and ill suited right to the schmaltzy finale."
1,Rotten,"The finale is like watching Mexican pro wrestling, except instead of wearing colorful masks, they're covered with fur...it doesn't suck, but it doesn't have much bite, either."
1,Rotten,"Not only is Student of the Year cinematically stale, but it's also politically dishonest."

1,Rotten,"CABAL CUT: We get a little more Decker, and quite a bit more redneck rampaging, but there is also inevitably a whole lot more Boone. Longer does not equal better, esp. in horror, and all this extra stuffing does not stop a turkey being a turkey."
0,Fresh,"An exceptionally moving, beautifully modulated film, hopefully eye-opening for those whose eyes have been closed for far too long."
0,Fresh,Robert Bresson's story of an imprisoned and condemned French Resistance fighter who plans an escape with his teenage cellmate is one of the great classics of European art cinema.
0,Fresh,"Dark Waters is special because it's not about dramatically building to an inevitable victory, but about the importance of fighting every day anyway, knowing such a conclusion may never come."
0,Fresh,"May be the most important film released in the past year. Among the class of 2004, it is certainly one of the best."
0,Fresh,"It is a fantastic entertainment, so full of delight and goodheartedness that I find myself uplifted every time I even think about it."
1,Rotten,"McAvoy's performance is good for a few laughs, but the doctor never seems capable of sustaining a serious thought, let alone creating life."
0,Fresh,An interesting (and sometimes aggravating) mix of what made Hergé's stories so pleasurable with Steven Spielberg's knack for big budget action epics.
1,Rotten,"The film's existential questions ultimately inspire one to sit up in the movie theatre and wonder, ""Why am I here?"""
0,Fresh,"Justice League Dark characters are grounded, flawed, dysfunctional, and fun. They don't pretend to be altruistic or pretend to get along. However, they know when its time to get down to business."
1,Rotten,"This B-movie made on an epic budget is so over-the-top that the earlier you start giggling the better. Even though it's played dead straight, it's an old-style monster romp that couldn't be any more camp if it tried."
0,Fresh,What remains constant is Reichardt's ability to coolly present thorny sociopolitical and moral issues.
0,Fresh,Yet another vehicle in which Simon Pegg can play yet another of the world's more obnoxious humans. And still make us love him.

1,Rotten,"The cast is pleasant enough to enliven the generic material, though much of writer-director Marcus Markou's dialogue is beyond salvaging."
0,Fresh,All new 3-D Alice story is trippy and intense.

0,Fresh,The Phantom of the Opera belongs in the collection of any serious horror film buff.
0,Fresh,"Ted 2 isn't cinematically special; the plot structure and shot framing is identical to MacFarlane's animated TV shows. But my god, is it funny. Trashy, nasty as it wants to be funny. Wake up the next day still giggling funny. Yes, that funny."

0,Fresh,"The movie is idealistic and corny, but by the end, I was laughing and crying along with it."

1,Rotten,"...as far as bringing a superhero angle to the real world, the Spider-Man franchise has done a more convincing job than this sitcom approach."
0,Fresh,A stirring and solid tribute to the late dance instructor.
0,Fresh,"If 10 Cloverfield Lane is to be considered a sequel, it's one that's even better than the original."
1,Rotten,The lack of overt instances of exposition consequently ensures that one's enjoyment of the movie is directly related to one's familiarity with Baricco's book...
1,Rotten,"Somehow this off-brand Fast and Furious makes Vin Diesel's flagship franchise feel restrained, intelligent and believable by comparison."
0,Fresh,"[it] does peter out in the end - it's perhaps too ambitious in telling too many stories - but visually it pops, its cast is terrific and the director's retrofitting of Ledger's role works far better than one would imagine."
1,Rotten,"Rest assured, the decision to remake this film had nothing to do with art, creativity, comedic zen, or some form of tribute to Sellers or Blake Edwards."
0,Fresh,"Yet it's The Walking Dead's Gurira who steals the show as the ferocious Okoye, gloriously swinging her spear in a billowing red gown."
1,Rotten,"The number of remotely chucklesome jokes in Neal Brennan's comedy is way too low, and the stuff in between them is grimy and depressing."
1,Rotten,"Not one character makes sense, there is no shred of craft, and the script sounds like it was written by a 6-year-old who has accidentally swallowed a microchip."
0,Fresh,A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they've rarely been given.
1,Rotten,"Unsympathetic characters, a lead performer that does not register, and a script that comes across like improvisations do not bode well for Jake Paltrow's debut feature."
0,Fresh,"A deceptively enjoyable, very old-fashioned romantic drama."

1,Rotten,Pitch Perfect 3 moves too much into comedy-action territory to truly feel like the scrappy musical this trilogy started out being.
0,Fresh,"The surprise element here is that the film takes Monica's career, and her love of the game, as seriously, probably more seriously, than it does Quincy's."

0,Fresh,"Though in many respects Deadpool 2 is funnier, filthier and certainly better directed in the action stakes than its predecessor...it's also a film that gleefully sacrifices sacred cows while remaining reluctant to touch any labelled ""cash."""
0,Fresh,"Gabbert's film is part portrait, part city symphony. It celebrates Gold as a fixture of his native Los Angeles and L.A. as in thrall to its stalwart guide."
0,Fresh,"Though hewing to a too-conventional structure, Bowser's film is densely researched enough to yield insights not just into its overlooked subject, but also into his overly analyzed era."
0,Fresh,"Midway through, an eerier theme creeps in, all the more powerful for Herzog's lack of insistence. By the 'end of the world' he means the end of the world."

0,Fresh,one of the funniest movies of the year
1,Rotten,"This is one of those in-your-face, angry, confrontational movies. It wasn't just a chore to sit through, it was more like a homework assignment given to you by a teacher who hates your guts."
1,Rotten,"With its role-reversing twist, it's sexy, sappy and shallow."
1,Rotten,"Though visually engaging, overall the film is a mixed bag of the strengths and weaknesses of the sci-fi world Lucas created."
0,Fresh,[Reboux's] heartbreaking performance makes the movie quite watchable in spite of its obvious flaws.
0,Fresh,"[VIDEO ESSAY] Everyone knows capitalism is a racist construct to begin with. It's funny watching an African American girl turn ""the white man's burden"" on its head."
0,Fresh,The story's dark psychological heart plays second fiddle to the action - to the film's detriment.
0,Fresh,"Desierto might not hold up the longer you try and analyze it, but as an in the moment thriller, it's brutally effective that keeps your attention right to the end."
1,Rotten,"Dermot Mulroney's 'Man with No Name' drifter is all too appropriately at the centre of offbeat auteur Calvin Reeder's 'Film with No Point', The Rambler."
0,Fresh,"Action packed and well paced, the film delivers exactly what it promises in terms of its style and quality effects and should appeal to the 15 to 24 crowd"
0,Fresh,"Moral ambiguity is center stage, and the film ultimately succeeds by sending audiences home to ponder their own levels of sin."
0,Fresh,Writer/director Trey Edward Shults is a dab hand at creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and menace and does a fine job of showing how people disintegrate under duress. The performances are very convincing here.

0,Fresh,Stands as a wrenching tale of power abused and lives discarded. It is powerful stuff.
1,Rotten,"With colossal sets, a remarkable cast, and hundreds of extras, this sci-fi comedy-adventure spoof of '30s movies should be funny and adventuresome, but it falls flat."
1,Rotten,"This Is Spinal Tap was able to turn the knob up to 11 -- with Popstar, 4 on the dial is the best one can reasonably expect."
0,Fresh,"As a thriller, Traitor excels and feels especially relevant, considering the subject matter."
0,Fresh,"A lot of what doesn't fully work in Blame can be attributed to the fact it's a first time screenplay from a young talent - and talented she is. The movie will put a new set of eyes on Shephard, creating a calling card for future projects."
0,Fresh,"Liam Neeson punches his way to justice in a respectably forgettable, good-while-it-lasts action thriller."
0,Fresh,"Simple Jack is not a bone-headed pandering Hollywood idea of what a mentally handicapped person might be like, but a joke about how Hollywood often misses the point and underestimates its audience."

0,Fresh,"For all of its obvious corporate ties, the film is still pretty entertaining, and has enough genuinely funny moments to propel you along."
0,Fresh,"For those on the hunt for something agreeable, feature two acting legends, there are worse ways to spend 108 minutes. After all it's not every day one gets to see Katharine Hepburn man a Gatling gun."

1,Rotten,"If you're expecting a scathing commentary on our media obsessed times, then Simone isn't it. If you're expecting a funny comedy, then Simone isn't it either."
1,Rotten,"A bloated and dull film kept alive by a thread of  fight scenes, an effortlessly charming Russell, and the mild entertainment of counting how many times someone says ""family."""
0,Fresh,"Really, what sticks in the mind is Michele's quiet stoicism, at once sad and unsettling."
0,Fresh,"It's basically a pop culture lover's dream come true, a film that pays homage to a time that gave us some incredible films, games, and music, all wrapped up as a gift to us from one of the greatest directors of all time."
1,Rotten,"The ultimate question is, was the movie purposefully made into a blur to play directly into the pockets of the fans, or do we chalk this up to standard-issue directorial incompetence? I vote the latter."

0,Fresh,The best teenage werewolf movie ever made.
1,Rotten,... a perfunctory little picture that doesn't go far beyond sitcom superficiality.
0,Fresh,"Unfettered by irony, inspiring the kind of spontaneous emotional response we yearn for at the multiplex, [it] immerses us in joyful illusion, a world of movies within movies."
1,Rotten,"Dull, overlong, and never remotely involving, ""Scoob!"" makes the silly Matthew Lillard-starring live action films seem rather quaint and joyful by comparison."
1,Rotten,"It soon devolves into a mess of slit throats and competing motives. Everyone, it seems, has a plot - except the screenwriters."
0,Fresh,"In addition to Frankenheimer's direction, much of the excellence of this movie can be traced to the imaginative photography of one of the best in the business, James Wong Howe."

1,Rotten,"The production as a whole is too disjointed, repetitive and flat to really hang together."
1,Rotten,"Under all the stylistic flash and dash, his movie is barely comprehensible; its big surprise ending is no surprise at all; and its coda almost seems like an insult."
1,Rotten,"It doesn't have a thing to say other than that our weapons of mass destruction are bigger, more advanced and, you know, cooler than everyone else's, and it manages to say it with a borderline Breitbart air of supremacy."
1,Rotten,Smashed may be better at preaching to the choir and is likely to find its largest audience among struggling 12-steppers.
0,Fresh,"One of the best films of the year. You'll laugh, You'll Cry... You'll truly appreciate life!"
1,Rotten,"Much of Dolittle is dull and makes little narrative sense and judging by the reactions of the kids in my theatre, at times a tad too dark and kind of boring."
0,Fresh,"It thrills in seeing dumb people getting their due in hyper-stylized displays of violence, and yet it never feels contemptuous of them."
1,Rotten,"Wilson and Hudson can two-step with the best of them, but the music they sway to is repetitive and indistinguishable, a tune heard in countless romantic comedies of the past."
0,Fresh,"One of the great films of the year: stark, brave andunforgettable."
0,Fresh,... Shadow reveals itself to be more than the sum of its parts. The chaos is merely a doorway to balance.
0,Fresh,"...where shock, violence and disgust are presented as heroic responses to the status quo, and where revenge is an attitude born out of present sociopolitical iniquities."
0,Fresh,"The Mission: Impossible movies are not emotional experiences, but a visceral expression of Cruise's dogged desire to remain an action star. Even with top-notch filmmakers at the helm, he's become the true auteur of this series."
0,Fresh,"A grim little story, but it's leavened unexpectedly with humor and energy."
1,Rotten,"Terrence Howard nearly saves the latest widget from the inspirational sports movie mill, a movie heavy on cliches and light on truth."

1,Rotten,"Instead, what we have here is a fair, melodramatic biopic that underwhelms when compared to what truly great work Mother Teresa accomplished."
0,Fresh,"It is more a public service announcement than a movie, but it has to be more useful to its audience than a summer blockbuster offering Halle Berry's tips on how to use a bullwhip."
0,Fresh,It's a striking portrait of a pivotal figure.
0,Fresh,"Partiality is the heel in this Achilles film; though to this Achilles film's credit, it also outruns, as storytelling, the tortoise forebodings we might have had about a true-life plot so cerebral and cyber-centric."

0,Fresh,Here is the highest compliment Abrams and company could have hoped for: They leave Star Trek better than they found it.

0,Fresh,"On the whole, director Céline Sciamma masters the waxing and waning of moods... [But] one takes away Heloise's tousled hair and rich, satiated half-smile, and tends to overlook Sciamma's trouble settling on an ending."
0,Fresh,"the visual wit, game performances, and overflowing humanity have more than made up for the shortcomings by the time the film finds a final moment that's simultaneously abrupt and magical."
1,Rotten,"The wait is long and confusing, and this spoils the appeal of the film's bright visual attractions."
0,Fresh,The movie is whipped into a froth with ... skill and humor -- just like those Doris Day comedies.
1,Rotten,"Frankel turns the camera toward the canines as frequently as possible, but too often we're stuck with Wilson and Aniston's bland characters. You wonder if it might have been better to let sleeping dogs lie."

0,Fresh,"Even if you know nothing about the game of chess, I still recommend it to you."
0,Fresh,"[Gondry's] passion for cinematic invention is giddy and palpable, with the rudimentary charms of fellow Frenchman and turn-of-the-century filmmaker Georges Melies."
1,Rotten,"It comes with its full quota of sex, conspiracy and violence, but the story is told in such circumspect fashion that next to nobody was offended."
0,Fresh,"In a genre packed with derivative visuals and too hip for homeroom pop culture jibes, Coraline is a welcome return to pure animation splendor."

1,Rotten,"Although it's a mediocre thriller at best, it has a certain pulp charm and appealing toughness to it."
0,Fresh,It's the zany goggle-wearing yellow-hued Minions who provide most of the film's chuckles and who justify the otherwise pointless 3D when they break the fourth wall at the start of the credits with a set of loopy antics.
0,Fresh,"Casablanca is the most sociable, the most companionable film ever made. Life as an endless party."
1,Rotten,"Watching Pain & Gain is like having a stand-up comedian scream his entire act right into your year. After a while, it just becomes obnoxious and oppressive."
1,Rotten,It takes a mediocre movie like Before I Fall to illustrate how brilliant Harold Ramis' Groundhog Day is.
1,Rotten,It's a tale of two movies: a suspense thriller that doesn't quite embrace its horror premise and a light blockbuster actioner with idiots getting their comeuppance.
1,Rotten,"I realize it's only January, but The Dilemma is already in the running for worst movie of the year. It will be a hard one to top. Or bottom."

0,Fresh,The performances are strong--even the minor characters--and the atmosphere and tone are spot-on for a dark comedy.
0,Fresh,"It's not just a nostalgia-peddling cash-grab, offering raucous laughs contained in a jubilant male-bonding storyline."

0,Fresh,"Though likely to induce a saccharine seizure for a general audience, the movie is perfect for a girls' night out for mothers and their preteen daughters."
0,Fresh,"The movie matches its subject with a beautifully appropriate intelligence, and is smartly structured, switching perspectives from Alice's self-preservation to her family members' dealings so imperceptibly that a decisive moment never arrives."

1,Rotten,A morass of clichs and orientalism salvaged from the Hollywood backlot debris of 75 years ago.
1,Rotten,"With its voyeuristic gawking of faintly explicit sexual acts in a dark club setting, BearCity has more in common with William Friedkin's Cruising (made in 1980) than an upbeat modern film should."
1,Rotten,"Payne's heart might have been in the right place with this one, but the execution feels flippant at best."
0,Fresh,"Like all major Chaplin works, Dictator was a cheaply, but methodically, made film, a cardboard act of humanist defiance, and, thanks to its purity of purpose, the cheesier the jokes get, the harder they land."
0,Fresh,One thing has been made very clear -- Being John Malkovich wasn't a fluke.

1,Rotten,"It's a retread that's borderline obnoxious, visually inept, and dramatically flaccid."
0,Fresh,"A hilarious comedy of misunderstanding, and even at more than 70 years old, it seems as fresh and relevant today as ever."
0,Fresh,The film's appeal is at once sentimental and perverse: It's not every day that you get to see a 92-year-old woman soloing on 'Should I Stay Or Should I Go.'
0,Fresh,"Sporadically profound, not unlike a riff on the ""Dawn of Man"" chapter from 2001: A Space Odyssey."
1,Rotten,The problem with Russell Crowe's new take on the legend is that it has one muddy boot in history and the other in fantasy. The middling result is far from a bull's-eye.

0,Fresh,This sense luscious Korean film provides a luminous meditation on the wisdom of Buddhism and the ways in which life is an exquisite spiritual teacher.
0,Fresh,"Spicy and boiling-hot, this sensational early-'50s crime drama is a morality play disguised as pulp fiction -- a sprawling saga of corruption and redemption set against a flashy West Coast backdrop."
0,Fresh,A compulsively watchable movie that's also a provocative inquiry into the ability of the criminal-justice system to determine culpability and truth.
1,Rotten,"Schmaltzed up, dumbed down, bombastically-scored family drama of touchy-feely life lessons."
0,Fresh,"The power of this film comes not through the personal, although that is there, it comes through the tapestry woven by Wajda about that history, the exquisite recreation of the era culminating in a most dreadful and powerful final sequence."
1,Rotten,"It's understandable and laudable that they desire not to sensationalize the Bielskis, and they've made a worthy film. But their understated approach makes the struggle seem less urgent than it must surely have been."
0,Fresh,"A stark, controlled psychological thriller that unpicks its hero's troubled soul with forensic coolness."
1,Rotten,"Zonca has put together an ambitious and forthright story, but Swinton's contribution looks more like an actressy impersonation than a performance, and indeed Zonca's film itself looks like a European facsimile of Americana."

1,Rotten,"A film about the importance of putting away childish things, ""Ted"" is itself an immature comedy that boasts a clever premise but a rather sour spirit."
0,Fresh,This is a Robin Hood and his Merry Men kind of tale that just makes me feel good.
0,Fresh,"A compelling documentary that expands a little known chapter in the environmental movement to raise questions about how social protest should be staged, how terrorism should be defined and how civil disobedience should be handled by authorities."
0,Fresh,"Apocalypto is a stunning film, and arguably Mel Gibson's greatest achievement yet. There are no Hollywood stars or sex scenes, but a fascinating insight into the way of life of the people of the Mayan civilisation"
1,Rotten,A movie that never really flies and relies 100% on Harley Quinn's antics instead of character development or plot. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"Grant has never been better, nor has he ever looked better."
0,Fresh,"For a silly kids' comedy, this is exceptionally well-made."
0,Fresh,[Has] at least a semi-awareness of the ridiculous hooey it's slinging ... a B-movie that's almost as much fun to laugh with as it is to laugh at. Note: I did say almost.
0,Fresh,"It's perhaps the way in which DeBlois mixes all these elements - the heart, the action, the animation, the expanded world - together that makes How to Train Your Dragon 2 so utterly enjoyable."
1,Rotten,Even fantasies have rules.
1,Rotten,"It's heartbreaking how rich this failed project is, with enough poetry for several great movies, but not enough push for one."
1,Rotten,"The fight scenes are fun, but it grows tedious."
0,Fresh,"A fascinating, heart-warming and enjoyably educational movie that's a great, moving introduction to the War To End All Wars for younger children."
0,Fresh,About a Boy pulls off the savvy trick of teaching life lessons without making you gag on them.
1,Rotten,"The animal characters that roam the park are, sadly, uninspired, and there's only a small hint of magic created throughout."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, I felt more sorry for Moore - giving her all to a skeezy, tabloid psychodrama - than for her self-absorbed character."
1,Rotten,"As antihero with no redeeming qualities, Riley is slick-haired shallow but unfortunately also one-note, an expressionless DiCaprio."
0,Fresh,"The film does indeed deliver the laughs, and I suppose we can't ask much more than that in these mediocre summer months."
0,Fresh,"Not only a genuinely scary movie, but a brilliant sci-fi twist on the fear women too often feel. Leigh Whannell is quickly becoming a master filmmaker, and Moss shines."
1,Rotten,"An intriguing first half gives way to a really generic, dumb second half that all but eliminates any of the good will the film had going for it."
1,Rotten,It's simultaneously a lot more expensive and a lot cheaper.
1,Rotten,"There's no reason why an Adam Sandler feature should run over two hours, especially one like ""Sandy Wexler,"" where nothing actually happens outside of an extended impression of Wernick only a small group of Hollywood insiders are going to get."
0,Fresh,"Mr. Bergman may not be praised for it, but he has made a thoughtful, engrossing, shocking film."
0,Fresh,"The League of Extraordinary Gentleman is the most literate movie of the summer. How many summer movies reference Moby Dick and Around the World in 80 Days? Kids won't know the literature of Melville and Verne, but it sets the tone for"
0,Fresh,It never rises past a second-rate thriller.
1,Rotten,There's too much talent involved in Keeping Up With The Joneses for it not to be considered a disappointment.
0,Fresh,A pretty transparent nostalgia exercise that never veers from formula and takes no risks. But it's still exceptionally funny and enjoyable.
1,Rotten,"A lot of folks go in for this movie in a big way, but I have a hard time seeing past the cloying comedy and clichd white-guy sentimentality."
1,Rotten,The charismatic cast (particularly Banks and Lopez) manage to find the humanity in their clichd roles but they can't transcend all the surface-level schmaltz on display here.
0,Fresh,"Cheap and virtually plotless, Friday the 13th keeps cycling back to those low expectations: as a scary campfire tale, it gets the job done."
0,Fresh,They don't make Sherlock Holmes films better than this superbly cast and told 1959 version from Hammer Studios...
0,Fresh,Informative and eyeopening topical documentary on the Russian doping scandal in cycling that then stumbles onto an international Olympic scandal also involving the Russians.
0,Fresh,"It presents us with a satirical image of a country which is cracked and fractured into pieces, a crazy-paving that isn't fitting together. Without the powerfully charismatic Gleeson, I suspect, the film itself wouldn't fit together."
1,Rotten,"Cliche-ridden and strangely aloof, Miseducation elicited little in the way of an emotional response from me beyond frustration."
0,Fresh,"Moner has the trickiest part, requiring her to embody the spirit of a child but the pluck of a more capable teenager. She makes Dora so endearing that even viewers who have little experience with the show may somehow feel a twinge of nostalgia for it."
0,Fresh,"More than anything else, Into the Woods feels like a clever fairy tale for adults - and yet another example of Disney's curious effort to subvert its own past."
0,Fresh,"The best jokes in Shrek spoof Disney tradition; the villain's lair looks suspiciously like a certain theme park's Main Street USA, and a bluebird of happiness explodes during a sugary crescendo."
0,Fresh,Dolemite is My Name is a rousing crowd-pleaser.
1,Rotten,"I've rarely seen a more rabidly inconsistent film -- astute one moment, stupid the next."
0,Fresh,"Energetic, laugh-stuffed and very colorful."
0,Fresh,"Zhang Yimou serves up a sumptuous sensory feast with spectacular set pieces and--crucially--the story, characters, and connection to back it up."
0,Fresh,A poignant look at cultural identity and its place in modern society.
0,Fresh,"The Limits of Control is hard work for the audience yet by degrees rewarding, captivating and fascinating."
0,Fresh,"The film's star, Catalina Sandino Moreno, has heavy-lidded eyes and a lovely, open face that belie Maria's steely resolve."
0,Fresh,"Sausage Party is, by turns, a subversive religious allegory, a hilarious sendup of horror and adventure clichs, a wicked commentary on real-world politics, a jab at racial and religious stereotypes, and a rude and lewd comedy."
1,Rotten,The tension between verisimilitude and economy of storytelling dictates everything in All Eyez on Me.
0,Fresh,"Why is this such a good Star Trek movie? Well, Spock makes a mean captain, standing in for the imprisoned Kirk."
1,Rotten,"It was a helluva comeback, John. Now go away."
0,Fresh,"Verdict - If you're suffering from acute insomnia, buy a ticket and slip in at the interval."
1,Rotten,"If you like watching Owen Wilson play the same character he's played for most of his Hollywood career, and like to be able to predict every comic bit in a movie, You, Me and Dupree is your cup of tea -- or, maybe, your six-pack."
0,Fresh,Co-writer/director Pete Docter's computer-animated film suggests greatness at the start and follows through on that promise.
0,Fresh,"Conversely, The Disaster Artist - a new film about the making of The Room - is not only the rare example of a genuinely funny biopic, but a subtle meta-commentary on the state of cult filmmaking."
0,Fresh,This strange mixture of whimsy and carnage never lags and becomes increasingly engaging.
0,Fresh,"Aronofsky brings glorious new meaning to the term 'melodrama' as he refashions the tragic tale of the Swan princess into a sexy, haunting and sublimely over the top cinematic romp."
1,Rotten,"The film blatantly strip-mines The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and anything else its makers can get their paws on."
0,Fresh,The filmmakers have taken prose and turned it into a sweeping visual experience that stirs the very soul
1,Rotten,"The story unfolds with little regard for subtlety, and wisecracks are what pass for humor. When a gaggle of gangly ostriches offers one of the biggest laughs, wit clearly is at a premium."
0,Fresh,"Spielberg's wondrous movie has remained its own thing, which is something of a miracle."
0,Fresh,The way De Palma stitches this multimedia montage into a damning narrative is cinema at its angry and exhilarating best.
0,Fresh,The most grown-up depiction of emotionally meaningful sexual relations... that will have any sort of general distribution in U.S. movie theaters in this or any of the next several years.
0,Fresh,Where Rampling really bares herself is in the emotional revelations and rawness she delivers in just about every screen.
0,Fresh,"The acting anchors a tale that might otherwise have spun off, weightless, into realms celebrated by Carl Sagan."
0,Fresh,"Through elliptical and seemingly oblique methods, he [Malick] forges moments of staggering emotional power."
0,Fresh,One of the better films of the infamous J-horror remake onslaught. Relatively speaking.
0,Fresh,"The film's emotions are obvious and blunt, but they get the job done."
0,Fresh,"... its ending does show the challenge of finding a conclusion to such an oddball story, and the results are only partly satisfying. Still, as he did in 1999, Jonze has his finger on the zeitgeist."

1,Rotten,You will consider Bulletproof Monk to be one of the best films ever made ... for the first ten minutes.
0,Fresh,"Even before its release, The Talented Mr. Ripley has attracted some mighty serious analytic attention."
1,Rotten,"This doc offers a wealth of important information, but sometimes couches it in a too loaded and sometimes inappropriate style."
0,Fresh,"Seeing these characters 20 years on has its own pleasure, especially since there was no reason to think that any of them would actually live past 30."
0,Fresh,"Despite the fact that the film doesn't stick the landing, its commitment to a classic musical truly makes it stand out. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1,Rotten,"If you're a spy thriller fan or love the perpetually underrated (and in need of a better agent) Eckhart, you may be surprised. Everyone else has a better alternative this weekend."
1,Rotten,"While Stallone (67) and De Niro (70) have done a commendable job keeping their waistlines in check, the vision of the two actors shuffling about the ring in an awkwardly choreographed slapfest is not inspiring."
0,Fresh,Essential viewing for sex-obsessed couples.
1,Rotten,"There are other plot holes (four days indoors and the dog doesn't have to go?) but, dispiritingly, Firewall is one of those movies where every detail in the first act is designed to pay off by the third."
1,Rotten,...I was checking my watch every few minutes?even though I knew that I wasn?t wearing one?just because it gave me something to do.
0,Fresh,"It's a mess, but a glorious one, the kind of ambitious, unapologetic project that's most notable for its perspective."
0,Fresh,"It may be the 9/11 movie to which the most people can relate. For most of us, that date wasn't about personal heroics or losing loved ones or survival. It was about processing the impossible and realizing that life, with all its ups and downs, must go on."
1,Rotten,Never manages to rise above kind of cute.
0,Fresh,Black Hawk Down is all dazzling craft and no redeeming art; it's simultaneously a superb piece of filmmaking and a highly suspect film.
0,Fresh,"The growing darkness as the film goes on seems as much metaphor as actuality, but how far those shadows reach is up to the viewer to discern. The magnificence of Horn's performance makes this compelling viewing regardless."
0,Fresh,"As a plunge into the feeling, rather than the denotative qualities, of medieval literature, it's a great pleasure."
0,Fresh,"An inspired, invigorating comedy that will have you laughing from its opening moments to its closing credits."
1,Rotten,"Paranoid Park confirms that Gus Van Sant is so far up his own artistic anus, it's impossible to take anything he makes seriously anymore...a crisp, white hanky doused with cinematic chloroform pressed tightly across the face."
0,Fresh,"Yes, there are machine guns, helicopters and car chases. But Mamet's inimitable rhythms and his taste for particularized lingo give the action stuff a certain personality."
0,Fresh,"Visually, this is an exquisitely composed film, and it teems with curiosities and compassion. If on occasion the story seems to wander, it arrives at an enchanting destination."
0,Fresh,"A good action adventure with some comedy thrown in, and Mary Louise Parker steals the show"
0,Fresh,"How does Hirokazu Kore-eda do it? His films are so casually infused with graceful realism, they make other movies feel painfully stilted and false."
0,Fresh,Boasts barbed-wire performances from both actresses.

0,Fresh,"Naturally, a subject this right-on draws a right-on cast."
1,Rotten,"Spall brings muffled humanity to Lowry but, thus housebound, he remains a sketch rather than a portrait."
0,Fresh,Don't expect a profound dish. Do prepare for a light meal with enough oddball humor to maintain involvement.
0,Fresh,It's a lot more tightly focused than the first outing.
1,Rotten,'Sierra Burgess is a Loser' could only envelop those who are willing to ignore the film's weaknesses. [Full Review in Spanish]
0,Fresh,"It takes a few minutes to catch on, and it would be indiscrete to specify what it is, but once you figure out what's really strange about it you have entered the solipsistic prison of a tormented mind."
1,Rotten,"The filmmakers stuff the film to a manic degree, albeit with increasingly textured animation."
1,Rotten,"This bizarre, quasi-existential neo-Western thriller is full of brainy chit-chat but doesn't actually offer any real ideas. The characters are so thin that the outcome of their conflict doesn't really matter."
0,Fresh,Why don't they make more movies like this? ... literally takes your breath away ... it's easily one of the best movies of the year.
0,Fresh,"And boy howdy, does that dialogue howl like a basset hound pup who's just been yanked from his momma."

0,Fresh,The creatures -- which range from a human-sized frog to a sprite with a big metal box for a head -- provide a worthy showcase for Murakami's prodigious visual imagination.
1,Rotten,This is the type of natural disaster for which Westboro Baptist Church and Pat Robertson would surely blame those silly Californian liberals.

0,Fresh,Fallout puts out some of the most impressive and thrilling action sequences ever committed to film.
1,Rotten,"Based on Stephen Jeffreys' play, about 17th century iconoclastic poet the 2nd Earl of Rochester (Johnny Depp), ""The Libertine"" fails to pay off on its promises of taboo sex."

1,Rotten,"Flighty, fanciful and amusing - but quickly forgettable"
1,Rotten,Great idea--a musical with actors who can't sing.
1,Rotten,"This Romanian drama suffers from a flaw common to many European films: too much intellect, not enough heart."
1,Rotten,"he movie bows down to Morrissey's subsequent persona, planting references to future Smiths' lyrics - the Moors Murders, the violent friction of a Manchester street fair - in a way that that makes inspiration soundly uninspiring."
0,Fresh,"While I will commend the directorial style 'til the cows come home, Attraction's story didn't do much for me."
0,Fresh,A lustrous essay on the alluring trapdoors of the romantic image
1,Rotten,"Daredevil might have worked if Johnson had gone all out and made a truly adult superhero movie, embracing an R rating."
0,Fresh,It's safe to say that he [writer/director Mitchell Lichtenstein] has made the boldest debut of this admittedly young year.
0,Fresh,"An intricate, heartfelt tribute to the enduring power of love."
1,Rotten,A simple mechanism to deliver squib packs and swear words.
0,Fresh,"Like a well-crafted novel, Broken Embraces takes its time revealing its true intentions...an emotional time bomb, packed with passion, color, romance and tragedy."
0,Fresh,One of the year's most emotionally affecting movies.
0,Fresh,Worth watching because of the strong cinematography and the glimpses of strange beauty in the dance moves.
0,Fresh,"If you want a good laugh at a bad movie, Burnt Offerings doesn't have to be thrown in the ash can."
1,Rotten,"It's a facile comedy of manners, a story in which the three daughters have somehow been taught by their upbringing to put a consistent face on everything. Their incessant telephoning is like a way of staying in tune."
1,Rotten,"Were it not for Johnny Depp's crassly reassured character creation of scoundrel pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, there would be nothing to relish in this overlong and witless waste of celluloid based on a Disneyland ride."
1,Rotten,"It's structured in familiar, safe terms, plays for very low stakes, and appeals to no one so much as white, male teenagers with chips on their shoulders."
0,Fresh,"As a tribute to these fearless freedom fighters, it's a worthy effort - and as a welcome, and sobering, antidote to the knockabout silliness of Inglourious Basterds, you couldn't really get any better."
0,Fresh,"Works on a basic pressure-cooker level, but its greater messages are too broad to behold and too familiar to take full emotional stock in."
1,Rotten,"The Mechanic is ham-fisted pulp, like Robert Rodriguez's Machete taking itself seriously."
1,Rotten,A rotten pseudo-follow up to the dynamic first film...
0,Fresh,"A welcome reunion with some very special friends, Bill and Ted Face the Music is a wonderfully nostalgic blend of two beloved classics"
0,Fresh,[A] sweet natured and showy go-go boys drama.
0,Fresh,"Ridiculous at times, but always entertaining and fun."
1,Rotten,"The dumbest, most risible retelling ever made of the exploits of legendary bank robber Jesse James."
0,Fresh,"In not providing enough action but not providing enough character to warrant this cast, it engages for a while but may leave you wondering why they bothered."
1,Rotten,"The film's San Francisco locale looks great, and the movie has random moments of sparkle. But it reeks of familiarity."
0,Fresh,"Telling the tough truth instead of being lied to with a glamorized version of theatre through rose-colored glasses, ""The Last Five Years"" establishes Anna Kendrick as a serious singer through Jason Robert Brown's naturally flowing, unpretentious music."
1,Rotten,"Despite its earnest tone and unremittingly solemn performances, the entire movie feels like a simulation, devoid of lifelike detail or tangible dramatic stakes."
1,Rotten,"Double Tap has its moments, but overall there is nothing surprising or fresh or interesting here."
0,Fresh,LL Cool J with his natural charisma is the key to the movie's edge.
0,Fresh,"Essential viewing for fans of the cinematographer's craft, Craig McCall's fascinating documentary about one of the greatest cameramen of all time is a film to be cherished."
1,Rotten,A lot of fumbling follows as the film threatens to die of boredom... It's all a little too half-hearted.
0,Fresh,The highlights of Evan Almighty aren't the supernatural moments but the scenes in which Carell grows comically flustered with his situation.
0,Fresh,"Lewin in his story and his screenplay adroitly mingles these ingredients, and sets the narrative amid the poetic and flamboyant landscapes of nature and life in Spain."
0,Fresh,"Wysocki is a genuine talent, as is Jacobs, but the subject of ""Terri"" remains a pleasant blur."
1,Rotten,"The more, where there could be less, has the story dragging its feet."

0,Fresh,Each actor comes to perfectly embody his character.
1,Rotten,Too bad audiences didn't.
1,Rotten,"An overlong, overstuffed melodrama whose solid performances can't completely mask novelist Kazuo Ishiguro's unwieldy script."
0,Fresh,"At this point Fey and Poehler have perfected that kind of in-sync comic timing. If they can apply that to movies that are actually good, they may still make some classics."
0,Fresh,"Loses steam toward the end, but, nonetheless, manages to be a fascinating and heartfelt drama filled with suspense, intrigue and lush cinematography."
1,Rotten,"Given the possibilities it's not particularly inventive, but it is nice to see a comedy so affectionate with the conventions it spoofs."
1,Rotten,"Inherently mawkish, simplistic and exceedingly numbing, this movie is woefully incomplete-much like a stale Twinkie treat without the creamy filling inside."
1,Rotten,"No one will see themselves in The Hunt, and only those inclined to ignorant caricature will fancy they recognize the others."
0,Fresh,Computer Chess is one of the most original and satisfying movies I've seen in ages.
0,Fresh,The movie has flashes of oldtime magic. It's a precious piece of time past -- and time kept.
0,Fresh,"This magnificent movie may be a film studies set text, but it defies attempts at explanation, and in fact, it has a unique way of wriggling out of any category you might try to impose on it."
0,Fresh,"This affecting, understated drama probably won't inspire Schwarzenegger to give up making Terminator movies. But it'll stand as proof that he didn't always have to do those to hold our attention onscreen."
1,Rotten,"All this would probably play better with the assistance of some weed, but it would be irresponsible to review a film while intoxicated."
1,Rotten,"Like all the Oracles throughout history advise, ""Temet nosce"" - well I know I don't want any more of this."
0,Fresh,"There's plenty of floods, thunderheads, cars submerged in water and heavy downpours to get yourself all wet on."

0,Fresh,Shrek Forever After is not that bad. That's what we've come to... evaluating a multi-million dollar summer tent-pole release as 'not that bad.'
0,Fresh,"Throughout there are jokes that feel like in-jokes, about Chinese customs and business practices, but viewers will catch on, just as a visitor might, and start to get the feel of things."
1,Rotten,"There are some laughs to be had, albeit not always in the right places. A resounding plop."
0,Fresh,Thrives on its main character being articulate by being inarticulate.
1,Rotten,"Aside from a sprinkling of salty language and few shots of people on cell phones, it practically could go into immediate rotation on Turner Classic Movies."
0,Fresh,Iannucci masterfully blends dark humour about an authoritarian regime and farcical comedy performed with perfect timing.
1,Rotten,"Floundering, only intermittently funny. Wait for the dvd."
1,Rotten,"May have no objectionable material parents will find offensive for children, but just about every viewer will be offended by the patronizing hooey stuffed down their throat."

0,Fresh,Cooper uses Hollywood's favorite creation myth to recreate how audiences will forever perceive him and Gaga.
1,Rotten,"The script's failure leaves a heavy burden on the cast, and how well they compensate is both a testament to their talent and a waste of it."
0,Fresh,Ends up just being a fairly good Bad Movie.
1,Rotten,"You are hereby recommended to pay matinee price, then walk out just before the ending - whatever you imagine as the finish will be better than the actual finale."
1,Rotten,"None of the actors has a character to play, but each brings a likable persona to Wild Hogs, and that helps smooth over more of the stinky script's rough edges than you'd expect."
0,Fresh,"The new, original docu Babies assumes the shape of a sharply observed, highly visual cross-cultural anthropological exploration without in the least being didactic, academic or judgmental."
1,Rotten,"Finding Nemo and Shrek 2 really raised the bar for computer-animated films, and that makes the flaws here seem more glaring."
0,Fresh,The two characters demonstrate that the communion between the old and the new isn't only possible but ideal. [Full review in Spanish]
1,Rotten,A dull and obvious film posing as a subtle character study.
0,Fresh,"And yet, abetting Raw's piecemeal feel is Jim Williams' scattershot score that is, at times, classical, vaguely industrial, and at one moment, pop. It even gooses you with blaring volume concurrent with crucial moments of sex and violence."
0,Fresh,"This fun, fast-moving film is a directorial debut for Olivia Wilde, who helped polish a script kicking around for a decade-one written by four women, not to the detriment of its general cohesion and frequent hilarity."
0,Fresh,"A surprisingly talented Will Forte plays the son of a cantankerous old drunk, the fascinating Bruce Dern, as he takes a road trip to claim a million-dollar sweepstakes prize that no one thinks he's won. This is Alexander Payne at the top of his game."
0,Fresh,"Stodgy, but more edifying and entertaining than 'Pearl Harbor.'"
0,Fresh,"Satire is awfully hard to pull off, but screenwriter Adam Wierzbianski exhibits a flair for it."
0,Fresh,... fun and a good time... just ignore all the nameless characters dying horribly in the background and everything will be fine.
1,Rotten,"The redundant violence, no matter how loud and brutal it can be, lacks both tension and imagination. We get plenty of bangs without any of the requisite foreplay."
0,Fresh,F**k I loved this movie!
1,Rotten,"Little more than a muddled cacophony of clichéd dramatic twists and transparent developments, somehow belying its eloquent and graceful leitmotif."
0,Fresh,"Director Shyamalan really gets his mitts on you with this one: It's wild and suspenseful, and without his trademark trick of pulling the rug out from under you at the end with such a vigorous tug that you end up on your backside and not terribly amused."
0,Fresh,"DeMille's trademark sensibility aside, the two sections illustrate what the director gave up in his transformation into epic moviemaker."
1,Rotten,"Technically, it's impeccable. But it's madly out of synch with the 12A certificate."
0,Fresh,"Bulger was a cruel killer and an ally of Irish Republican fascism but it's not all bad, he gave us Johnny Depp back."
1,Rotten,"Prepare to be dazzled, we are told in the first few minutes, as fireworks are lit in eager anticipation. But the fireworks fizzle big time, as does this tedious, tired comedy that is short on appeal and laughs. Wacky and low-brow it is, but fun it ain't"
1,Rotten,The movie ... is pleasant but forced.
1,Rotten,"A meandering mess, a plodding dud."
0,Fresh,"This odd mix of domestic drama and quirky coming-of-age comedy is a charming tribute to nostalgia, individuality and the power of imagination."
1,Rotten,"It remains trapped, lost between opulence and ruin, between humans and ghosts. It might have made the blood run cold, but instead, the movie itself is cold-blooded."
1,Rotten,"Smug but fascinating: The movie is a woman's cry of anguish for an unjust world that enables men at all levels of age and power to get away with cruelty, brutality, murder and even war because, well, 'that's what boys DO.'"
1,Rotten,Who'd have thought a Danish soap opera would be as bad as an American one?
0,Fresh,"Nothing about The Perfection is what you'd expect, which is what makes watching it such a weirdly thrilling experience."
1,Rotten,"This sentimental, lightweight biopic is more concerned with the childish passive-aggressiveness of Hitchcock's marriage than the inner-workings of his artistic mind."
0,Fresh,"Director Ana Sofia Joanes softens her agricultural agitprop attack with case studies that prove people can make sustainable, environmentally friendly methods work."
1,Rotten,"It will likely connect with fans of the book simply because it delivers on the cinematic promise of the story they loved but it's a pantomime, a film going through the motions without a hint of an actual pulse."
1,Rotten,"Finally places the franchise securely in territory it's managed to avoid twice, against all odds: this movie pretty obviously just wants to sell toys to kids."
0,Fresh,"The Last Black Man is clearly based on Fails' own biography, but the beauty of the film is that it unspools its vision of the city like a nostalgic musing on a dream half-forgotten."
1,Rotten,"Mills e Guinness protagonizam um belo duelo de interpretações, mas o filme se prejudica um pouco em seu terceiro ato, já que a resolução parece melodramática e artificial."
0,Fresh,"Brooklyn is a sweet, moving, gorgeously-shot tale about a woman trying to find where she belongs. If I see a better film this year, I'll be surprised."
1,Rotten,"For an ostensible action movie, the cast spends an awful lot of time standing around and looking lost. I can only guess that they were following their director's lead."
0,Fresh,"The stony performances don't really matter, and neither does the blunt dialog. But it's still great fun."
0,Fresh,William Wyler's heartbreaking postwar ballad seems even more radical today than it did in its Oscar-thick heyday. It's as non-propagandistic as an unemployment line.
1,Rotten,"Each of the three primary directions of the movie might make a fascinating film, but tied together, they never cohere, and you find yourself sitting through two long hours wondering why you are doing so."
1,Rotten,"If you're hungry for a good zombie homage to Romero's work, look no further than Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead. Bloodline is just plain rotten."
1,Rotten,"Director David F. Sandberg remains a horror guy at heart (Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation), and the ping-ponging between yuks and yikes leads to a pretty nasty case of aesthetic whiplash."
1,Rotten,"The technology keeps advancing but the soap opera stories remain just as corny as ever in Into The Storm, a 1970s-style disaster movie dressed up with 21st century special effects."
0,Fresh,"The film establishes a kinetic documentary effect, making the impact of every shoot-out and explosion a deeply personal experience."
1,Rotten,"The real problem with ""This Is 40"" is its lack of truth, that Apatow wanted to express something about married life, and it eluded him."
0,Fresh,This indie gem marks the arrival of Oscar season. McAnulty and Mackay give very natural performances that are real and genuine.
1,Rotten,"In the end, however expansive, action-packed and powerfully shot The Baader-Meinhof Complex undoubtedly is, it remains a disturbing hybrid that leaves the viewer jaded, bizarrely perplex and ultimately unsatisfied."
1,Rotten,The sex was good but the delirious lesbian mumblecore didn't leave a lasting impression.
0,Fresh,A welcome reminder of Bertolucci's directorial assurance.
0,Fresh,Greg Mottola's semi-autobiographical coming of age comedy is as smart and perceptive as they come.
0,Fresh,"""The awful thing about life is this: Everybody has their reasons."" Maleficent has a very good reason. Sensational Jolie creates the character's evolving emotions purely with her face."
1,Rotten,"feels slightly disjointed, as if all the parts aren't quite lining up and the progression of action that is supposed to build emotionally instead feels more like little more than a series of plot points."
0,Fresh,"A worthy follow-up to [Director James L.] Brooks' 1997 success, As Good as it Gets."
1,Rotten,Would that Jacob Estes had kept the particulars of his murder mystery as intricate as the sci-fi of his main characters' communion.
1,Rotten,"We all know New Jack City is making the right statement on drugs, racism, the system, etc. But the fact is it's not very good."
0,Fresh,"The director and damaged vet doesn't flinch from the images of refugee youth with crucifixes carved into their chests by their captors, the screams and slaughter, and the gnawing self-accusation - am I now the Nazi? Dances With Uzis."
0,Fresh,"Quickly paced and surprisingly entertaining, this is a film for anybody who cares about the abuse of political power by the superrich. In other words, everybody but the one percent."
0,Fresh,"If Polanski ever managed to make a movie of Sylvia Plath's journals, the ones burnt by Ted Hughes after she committed suicide, and filmed it while high as a kite, the results might feel a little like the gonzo, bugged-out finale of this film."
0,Fresh,"Truly an oddball motion picture, Game is one part smutty romp, one part romantic comedy, with the entertainment value of the feature resting solely in how uncomfortably blunt it can get."
1,Rotten,"Are you looking for serious philosophizing, fluid filmmaking and stunning images? Or are satisfying drama and deep emotional connection what draws you in? Ideally you would have both, but that is not the case here."
0,Fresh,"It's ambitious, energetic and downright fun. Director Gansel and his female-led cast manage to breathe refreshing new life into what some feel is an overdone subgenre in horror these days"
1,Rotten,"So full of shameless vanity that each ticket stub should come with a mirror, a make-up case, and a high-priced plastic surgeon."
1,Rotten,Vastly overrated; moderately charming but I think I laughed once.
0,Fresh,"A film like this can end honestly in only one way, and Ku is true to it."
0,Fresh,"Carregado de subtexto e profundamente crítico no que diz respeito ao conservadorismo norte-americano, traz Brando e Magnani impecáveis e intensos em uma narrativa sensível e impecavelmente comandada por Lumet."

0,Fresh,"For something that looked as potentially stupid as it did in the trailers, you'll be laughing a heck of a lot."
0,Fresh,"Instead of really being scary, the film made me think of something that has troubled me since: don't movie characters watch movies?"
0,Fresh,How ironic that woman who was the victim of such bad fortune and terrible cruelty would leave the world such a generous parting gift.
0,Fresh,Disturbing beyond its graphic nature namely because of the widespread complicity in the town and unwavering cruelty.

1,Rotten,Misogyny disguised as empowerment.
1,Rotten,What you end up with is a cross between Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow and Shyamalan's Signs.
1,Rotten,"The Darkest Minds is such a formulaic hodgepodge of secondhand plot points that it can't help but feel like an insult to its target demographic: just another case of adults trying to manipulate kids, this time by bilking them out of their allowance."
0,Fresh,"You have been privy to a series of seductive, ephemeral moments, drawn into the eternal rhythm of youth and connected with something old and durable, one name for which is art."
0,Fresh,An authentic-seeming portrait of a girl whose strong sense of self quietly exposes the insecurities and intolerance of those around her.
0,Fresh,"High marks also to Strong, the almost overly polite leader of the Jordanian security forces. His soft spoken demeanor attempts to mask the furiousness of his convictions"
1,Rotten,The franchise simply can't compete with better written and directed comic book offerings out there. This includes Howard The Duck...

0,Fresh,"It's fun and exciting, but also a bit overwhelming and muddled."
0,Fresh,"It's sweet. It's cute. It's adorable, and Jill Coulton invests the story with plenty of heart to make Abominable  a thoroughly entertaining adventure."
1,Rotten,"This is a misshapen venture, a horror-comedy without much in the way of laughs or scares."
1,Rotten,The clever use of historical figures like Howard Hughes and W.C. Fields is really the film's only highlight.
1,Rotten,"Compared to the adventurously life-affirming and death-acknowledging honesty of its heartfelt predecessor, this film literally comes in second in every regard."
0,Fresh,"It is a film worth revisiting, like a dream after waking, but an hour later you may not remember you ever had the dream at all."
0,Fresh,"Ambitious in scope and practically flawless in execution, Afflicted is good news for horror fans seeking something fresh and chilling from two impressively assured young filmmakers."
1,Rotten,"If you doze or play your GameBoy for an hour or so in the middle of the movie, you might find it an agreeable time-waster."
1,Rotten,"Not only is the animation unattractive, the voice cast is also completely devoid of charm"
0,Fresh,"Looks absolutely amazing, but it remains an exercise in style over substance that never gets beneath our skin."
0,Fresh,"The Shallows is brisk and engaging, and a great vehicle for Lively. The film has the sort of breathtaking cinematography that will inspire you to visit the ocean. And a story that may stop you from ever going into the water again."
1,Rotten,"The conceit of showing a pop-culture figure's life out of the limelight is beyond hackneyed, but the film's incongruous visual splendor and Penn's all-or-nothing commitment keep Sorrentino's unabashed folly afloat for a while."
1,Rotten,Stuffed with haphazard writing.
1,Rotten,Shutter Island is a long slog. The sad thing is that Scorsese could have connected emotionally with Lehane's narrative.
0,Fresh,"Apart from its anthropomorphic, allegorical angle, Zootopia is also a tale of female empowerment and a classic noir, too."

0,Fresh,"Jandreau proves a charismatic draw, even if some of the supporting non-actors struggle with naturalistic performances."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, despite the wonderful locations, sets, costumes, and strong acting, this adaptation has a strange lack of magic or chemistry between players."
0,Fresh,"A movie that's clearly not for everyone, but those at whom it's targeted-whether allowed to enter according to the R rating or not-will find it a hoot."

1,Rotten,"When the true nature of Antebellum is finally revealed, it might be shocking to some, but it made me question the purpose of the entire exercise."
0,Fresh,"It knows its mission parameters, and it ticks them off with alacrity."
0,Fresh,"It doesn't match up to the same level as Donnie Brasco, but In Too Deep is still a decent update of the gangster genre."
0,Fresh,The surprisingly adept mixture of tones ... is offbeat enough to keep even hardened connoisseurs of body-count entertainment on their toes.
1,Rotten,"Told from the McDonald brothers' POV, this is hardly an unbiased telling and it implies some dubious things. It's too bad that so much work was put into what appears to be a diatribe against Kroc. I'd like to see a more balanced effort."
0,Fresh,"It may be totally predictable and just a tad overlong and overdone, but Divergent is a far better foray into YA territory than Vampire Academy, or even The Host."
0,Fresh,"When all is said and done, Pacino is the riveting presence that makes the movie work and it is difficult to imagine any other actor in the part."
0,Fresh,"it is as though the original Ju-on had been merged with Lost in Translation, and the result is an intelligent reflection on Hollywood's flawed attempts to recreate Oriental horror in its own image..."

0,Fresh,"slick, sly, and super"
1,Rotten,Leguizamo and Swayze - and especially Snipes - just seem like Hollywood stars putting on a cabaret show. There is never any sense that these guys are real people.
0,Fresh,...pretty much cements Richard Eyre's status as a high-brow purveyor of trashy fare...

0,Fresh,You have to love a film that not only explains the concept of Schrödinger's cat but also includes a joke about it.
1,Rotten,"The average Hollywood action picture is aimed at 12-year-olds of all ages, but Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg's feature-length come-on for Hasbro's much-loved toy series (and its spin-off cartoons, video games and comics) aims even lower."
1,Rotten,It all feels too simplistic.
0,Fresh,"A sprightly valentine to the heady world of comedy, drama, romance, art, commerce and language that is the theater."
1,Rotten,"staid, ridiculous"
0,Fresh,"It's a title you simply must watch, not necessarily for the truths it packs but rather for the bombed-out buildings of postwar Italy, peripheral details that director Vittorio De Sica insisted on."

0,Fresh,Requires an expertise in Austen's works but rewards you with a decadently satisfying ending - a guilty pleasure.
0,Fresh,"The result is a sincerely moving low-key optimistic heart-felt film about trying to survive with the help of others, who are also trying to get by with their own problems."
1,Rotten,"Identity is the unwelcome new face of Hollywood horror: loud, empty, unimaginative and as far from Alfred Hitchcock as a movie can be."
0,Fresh,"What's really frightening about Honey isn't what a hive of angry bees might do to us, but what we've done to them."

0,Fresh,Dirty Girl is an off beat gem that's well worth the bidding war it inspired at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.
1,Rotten,"The American movie industry desperately needs a clever mystery thriller, but the sophomoric, nauseating and increasingly preposterous Red Lights fails to rise to that call."
1,Rotten,"The leads and their accomplices look dead glam, but it's never clear whether their vacuity is a deliberate strategy. Certainly Avary's style seems all for instant gratification."
1,Rotten,Just because King makes fun of himself for not being able to write a decent finish doesn't mean we should let him off the hook for this one.
0,Fresh,"An admirable thriller bursting with tension and superb turns by its stars Vanessa Hudgens, Nicolas Cage and John Cusack."
0,Fresh,"Because it's basically sketch comedy, it suffers from that unevenness that comes from trying to string a bunch of sketches together to form a cohesive whole. It is also ribald, outrageous, shameless, and oddly warmhearted."

0,Fresh,"From bow to stern, Chandor delivers pure cinema."
1,Rotten,"The film is basically a rich man's Uwe Boll version of Dungeons and Dragons -- a lot of tacky visuals, world-building mumbo-jumbo and gooey CGI creatures encased in a narrative vacuum."
1,Rotten,Yet another comic-book adaptation that should have stayed on the page...aims to be loopy and cool but only succeeds at being dumb and boring.
0,Fresh,"The World's End, in its frequent oscillations of tone, rides toward a logical end-point that makes for the simultaneous fulfillment and subversion of expectations."
0,Fresh,Villechaize as written is a glorious part - poignant as he wrestles with the limitations placed on him by others and infuriating as he spurns the help of those trying to save him from himself - even if it was far less fun in real life.
0,Fresh,"Viewers may find its mix of pathos and humor loose and lumpy, but then isn't that how life is?"
1,Rotten,"Although it seeks to send up their greatest on-screen achievements, this half-baked farce merely reinforces the idea that De Niro and Stallone have seen better days."
0,Fresh,"With his first film, Kerry Conran manages to replicate the feeling of unfettered, childlike innocence that George Lucas has been trying to reclaim for a quarter of a century."
0,Fresh,"Within the context of a sport that thrives on artifice, writer-director Stephen Merchant spins a story whose emotions feel entirely genuine."

0,Fresh,Enthralling and stunning. So it comes down to this: Darth Vader had a selfless good reason.
0,Fresh,"Those who manage to make it through the cultural differences will find Monster Hunt a charming, emotionally engaging and moreover intelligent film, one which will handsomely repay their suspension of some admittedly quite wilful disbelief."
1,Rotten,"A silly, preposterous romantic comedy that benefits from Josh Duhamel's self-assured likeability, which helps a thin script that relies on pratfalls not brain power."
1,Rotten,"This movie is well acted, but it does seem to operate on a single, rather depressing note throughout. It would have helped if there was more of an emotional story arc to it. It ends not far emotionally from where it starts."
1,Rotten,"t probably goes without saying that the self-involved, privileged Sydney would pay scant attention to the violence and poverty that make up life in Ana's pueblo."

0,Fresh,[Sandra Hller's] intensity is so compelling you truly have no idea if those demons are real.
1,Rotten,"This 1984 film's few and unimpressive special effects evidently qualify it as science fiction, but the genre it really belongs to is the male weepie: there hasn't been a gooier buddy romance on the screen since Joe Buck took Ratso Rizzo to Miami."

1,Rotten,"This is a movie in which the humor isn't just deadpan, it's inert."
1,Rotten,"Shoujyo: An Adolescent seems to be several movies at once: a hard-boiled detective story, a Lolita-style intergenerational romance and a family psychodrama complete with pat Freudian flashbacks."
0,Fresh,Wayne's World remains one of the best movies to emerge from SNL's celebrated stages...

0,Fresh,"Bergman blends a theatrical subjectivity with a tactile visual intimacy, with his characters, the objects close at hand, and the superb coastal landscape."
1,Rotten,"It lasts an astonishing 154 minutes, pushing on so far past its expiration date that you'll squirm uncomfortably for the final act."
1,Rotten,It all feels like so much petty sniping against progress.

0,Fresh,"A classic kids' movie, it redefines the word 'silly.'"
0,Fresh,"It may be Hollywood melodrama but it's top of the range, giving Clooney and Roberts every opportunity to demonstrate the value of star power. And it's refreshing to have a studio picture about anti-heroes rather than super-heroes."

1,Rotten,"Loud, dull and daft, this piece could do with crawling back to the cinematic primordial soup."
0,Fresh,Perfection pure and simple.
1,Rotten,"This is a Grand Guignol science fiction rock opera. The plot is minimal and for a rock opera, there is too little real melody."

1,Rotten,"Wilson has more than a handful of solid moments, but they are peppered between fairly stock observations about the way the world works, and how everybody tends to screw everybody else when given the chance."

1,Rotten,The problem is that the film is for the most part boring.
1,Rotten,"Southland is ridiculous in much the same way the Austin Powers movies are, but it's played straight."
1,Rotten,"The ""Bond In Space"" angle is all we need to write Moonraker off as daft, but... the whole script is a messy disaster."
0,Fresh,"It's the grown-ups who might feel slightly underwhelmed by it all, though they'll likely be moderately entertained by the action and adventure."
0,Fresh,"In the end, Submarine is another small-scale British film, hoping its charm will suffice - but then it steadily spoofs its own story, so we can't engage. Perhaps we're just not worth taking seriously?"
0,Fresh,"Side Effects looks like it's going to be an expose of America's prescription-drug addiction issues, before it swerves nicely into thriller territory, and a seemingly minor character becomes the protagonist."
0,Fresh,"Powerfully realistic film about ""mules"""
1,Rotten,Tediously obvious from the get-go.
0,Fresh,"A return to form for Jonathan Demme, acting tour-de-force for Hathaway, and simply one of the best films of the year."
1,Rotten,"As if allergic to pursuing any sort of distinguishable style, the characters exude a refurbished quality. What drives the design here are repackaged versions of other figures we've seen in countless, second-rate CG features over the years."
0,Fresh,"This Down Under horse opera is violent, grim and stunningly good."
0,Fresh,Good clean post-apocalypse fire-breathing fun.
0,Fresh,"It's an utterly brilliant film in that it evokes its intended feelings with apparent effortlessness -- not like a staged, contrived snapshot but like a wholly unique piece of art."
1,Rotten,The film is undone by the fact that both protagonists are obnoxious caricatures.
1,Rotten,Hicks ... coats the film in a bogus idyllic mist that substitutes cheap sentiment for blunt truth.
1,Rotten,Film theory students researching the sexual content of movies by women directors are probably the only viewers who will be satisfied...
0,Fresh,"10 Years is no Big Chill, but it has just enough warmth to keep it alive."
1,Rotten,"A whimsical comedy that contains tiny traces of drama, but lacks expressive power and fun characters. [Full review in Spanish]"

0,Fresh,"Joel McHale, in the role he was born to play"
1,Rotten,"A depressing cascade of gross-out humor, slapstick violence, hipster fast-talk and drug gags, to which are added a predictable streak of sentiment and a dollop of cheap enlightenment."
1,Rotten,"Cribbing desperately from The Lord Of The Rings, Reign Of Fire, and especially Beowulf, it's a snorgasbord of awfulness."
0,Fresh,"It's a good movie on a great subject, even if it is well short of a great film."
1,Rotten,"Haynes doesn't control Ruffalo's conceitedness. Weepy, anguished Ruffalo has lost the ability to portray normal behavior."
1,Rotten,"Well structured, but rather cold."
1,Rotten,"This movie feels like it has a million jokes, and every single one arrives with a lethal thud."
1,Rotten,A lot of emotion but not enough screenplay to keep things moving even for the spare 92 minute run time.
0,Fresh,"Equal part bedtime story and contemporary art museum installation, ""The Fall"" is unlike anything you've ever seen."
1,Rotten,"State Like Sleep is certainly a little more interesting than the cookie-cutter thriller that the ads suggest, but it is more likely to put most viewers into a state like sleep themselves."
0,Fresh,A highly composed technical tour de force.
1,Rotten,"There's not much for audiences over the age of 10 to warm to during this third, and hopefully final, Ice Age."
1,Rotten,an exercise in dramatic paralysis.
0,Fresh,Much more faithful [to the source material].
1,Rotten,"The result is a soggy swamp of nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyahing, its only grace notes are Giamatti's fine, nuanced performance as Heep and Christopher Doyle's handsome cinematography."
0,Fresh,Sharknado is an hour and a half of your life that you'll never get back. And you won't want to.
1,Rotten,"David Gelb's new film is so dependent on the classic standbys of the genre, and so slight in every other regard, that it immediately draws attention to just how creaky they've gotten over the years"
1,Rotten,An opportunity for the charismatic and funny Jude Law to take center stage and remind us why he deserves better roles than he's been getting. Including the one he's got in Dom Hemingway.
1,Rotten,"I generally don't like slapstick comedy, and this movie was no exception."
0,Fresh,"Putting the ""intelligence"" in MI6, Skyfall reps a smart, savvy and incredibly satisfying addition to the 007 oeuvre."
0,Fresh,"Polsky... consults with experts including Wayne Gretzky, Jerry Rice, and Pele, all of whom are vexed at the current state of things and advocate for a less-structured system that promotes initiative and creativity."

0,Fresh,This gorgeously designed and photographed movie artfully depicts the immigrant experience in ways that transcend its setting.
0,Fresh,"having suffered with my human through the dim-witted Beethoven and the dreadful Bingo, I found Homeward Bound to be a breath of animal-oriented realism, voice-overs or no."
0,Fresh,Sickeningly cruel or tenderly sweet. Sometimes it's one or the other; sometimes it's both at the same time. Perhaps the same statements are true of parenthood.
0,Fresh,"Porno's playfully amusing critique is woven into the fabric of its plot, although just as integral to the saga's charms is Racela's fondness for rubbing his audience's noses in the shocking, the lurid and the grotesque."
0,Fresh,"This is a film about the luxury of being non-judgmental, of spiritual generosity before it's shrunken by diminished expectations. Hideous Kinky recovers that fragile state of mind and vindicates its innocence."
0,Fresh,"With performances like these, the result is not so much an issue movie as a study of human quiddity and stubbornness under siege."
0,Fresh,An imaginative family film featuring a tremendously mischievous and likable lead character.
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, Manolo: The Boy Who Made Shoes For Lizards is better at capturing the tones of the times visited rather than proving the significance of its subject."
1,Rotten,"It is not a good movie in a way that feels exactly like what happens when filmmakers have absolutely no idea what to do, only a well-developed sense of what to avoid."
1,Rotten,The direction is stubbornly flat-footed.
0,Fresh,"One flash of Washington's warm, genuine smile is enough to hook anyone. There is a sincerity, a gentleness and a kindness that comes across no matter what role he plays and this one lets those qualities shine."
0,Fresh,"If you abandon your popcorn-movie diet where everything barrels along at such a fast clip, you'll discover a lovely and painstakingly detailed treasure, if one that is occasionally too inert for its own good."
0,Fresh,"Intimately, quietly, painfully, In the Fade reckons with supremacist beliefs, centering that process on Katja, and on Kruger, who breathes life and humanity into a film that intentionally lacks in both."
0,Fresh,A small winner.

0,Fresh,"The big, beating heart of ""Homecoming"" survives in ""Spider-Man: Far from Home,"" sustaining all the giddiness and relative innocence a fabulous superhero movie deserves."
0,Fresh,"Breakfast on Pluto may seem a fairy tale at times (no pun intended), but this Kitten has claws."
0,Fresh,"A story about an old man striving to make the best of the remains of the day, 'Mr. Holmes' succeeds most of all through forceful performances by Ian McKellen, Laura Linney, Hiroyuki Sanada and spunky junior cast member Milo Parker."
1,Rotten,"The nadir of this film's cynical, marketed traipse through the iconography of its franchise is in the preposterously pantomime mythologisation of Darth Vader."
0,Fresh,Bombshell is thankfully more than good enough to overcome both potential stumbling blocks.
1,Rotten,"Not quite the chariot crash I was secretly hoping for. The dialogue is dull rather than cheesy, the acting is disappointingly proficient and the 3D CGI effects are actually rather good."
0,Fresh,"The dialogue is hard-boiled and crackles with wit, the plot is fast-paced and nearly impenetrable, and Humphrey Bogart is coolly unflappable in Howard Hawkes’s stylish noir classic."
0,Fresh,"It is a stirring drama of World War II, in which Spiegel has had the excellent help of British director David Lean, in charge of the action, and of a fine company of international players."
0,Fresh,"Creates a very high benchmark for this summer's other films to strive to best, and I don't think any of them will."
0,Fresh,The entire thing - the whole weight of the movie - rests on the remarkable abilities of Saoirse Ronan ... she's an exceptional actor. She's one of a kind.
0,Fresh,The funniest movie I have seen in a long time.
0,Fresh,"Nolan creates here a rich, imaginative world that will fascinate you for the full two hours."
0,Fresh,"It's a filmmaker and, by extension, an entire studio smartly and vividly understanding that genius need only be translated to a different medium, not tampered with."
1,Rotten,"Neill Blomkamp, a maker of science fiction, has so many cool ideas jammed into his movies that coherence becomes a problem."
1,Rotten,"Australia only covers about two years in that continent's history. But as long as the movie feels, you'd swear it covered a decade ... or even a century."
0,Fresh,Good Daves western featuring Ford and Lemmon.
0,Fresh,"Sly, sometimes funny documentary version of Bottle Shock, with China playing the role of 1970s Napa as it creeps up to smack the snooty Old World wine snobs."
0,Fresh,Collette's performance is staggering. She plays Annie as a woman who begins to wear her buried rage and guilt on the outside.
0,Fresh,"A revamp everyone can get on board with, from die-hards to those who wouldn't be seen dead at a sci-fi convention. Buoyant, buffed and with the promise of even better to come, this is the freshest Trek in decades."
1,Rotten,"Predictable and without charisma, the movie only delivers half way: it's entertaining but it never really surprises. [Full review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,But Race is best appreciated as an allegorical shake-up with the focus on Jesse's big moments and competitions. And they feel quite big.
0,Fresh,Philip Noyce's anti-apartheid drama is tense and thoughtful.
1,Rotten,"Nocturnal Animals matches Tom Ford's A Single Man in terms of its visual vibrancy and solid performances, but it has opted to replace its beating heart with a leaden paperweight."
1,Rotten,"On those occasions when the movie makes sense, the implications are often so idiotic that we wish it didn't."
1,Rotten,"[H]alf good and half bad, and the primary dividing line is by genus."
0,Fresh,"The film is a deft, graceful and often poignant story of a woman's quest to find her own identity and a spiritual sanctuary that will give her life hope and meaning."
0,Fresh,"It's an essential documenting of where we are, and it leaves you with a lot of necessary, troubling feelings."
0,Fresh,"The film is clearly designed as a tribute to the unfaltering courage of those men, yet it is not some hollow, patriotic flag waver, nor is there much glory in the outcome. The battle scenes are vivid, graphic and often brutal."
0,Fresh,An above-average thriller.
0,Fresh,"Breathing new life into these old forms is a next-to-impossible mission, but if the skeletons in your closet are made of celluloid, ""Super 8"" will be more of a treat than a trick."
1,Rotten,"The trite, disappointing Youth, like its two heroes, never steps outside the spa's nostalgic comforts. Even its final concert scene, presented as a triumph, feels like a retreat into familiar flattery and self-regard."
0,Fresh,"There's something irresistible about it, something very like the lucky stardust with which Evans' life, even the bumps, has been paved."
1,Rotten,"A conversation with God should be inspirational and moving, but this conversation loses some of the magnificence and glory when it's channeled through this very ordinary movie."
0,Fresh,"The pleasant surprise of 8 Mile is that, despite the conventional structure of Scott Silver's script, Curtis Hanson hasn't made a film about Rabbit transcending his underclass roots, but embracing them instead."
1,Rotten,"Reams of tedious exposition finally give way to a random jumble of horror movie clichs, rising to a shrill pitch of hysteria that is never remotely frightening."
0,Fresh,Entertaining but almost too ambitious for its own sake ...
1,Rotten,"The climax, when it comes, is yet more of the fumbled plotting that has made the Fifty Shades films a trial to watch."
1,Rotten,There's a whole new genre of scary movies that might more accurately be called borey movies.
1,Rotten,"""Insidious: Chapter 3"" is simply not scary. Not a bit, not a whit. Except that the audience will be terrified of the next stabbing of their eardrums, at generally predictable intervals."
0,Fresh,"The buoyant little comedy 12:08 East of Bucharest puts its finger on the problem in the best tradition of East European humor, savvy but concrete, gentle but sharp as a knife."
0,Fresh,Down Terrace is a Brit-gangster film that rarely feels like one - and is much the better for it.
0,Fresh,"O'Haver ... has a great time juggling silly jokes, contemporary tunes and anachronisms like hand-cranked escalators at the medieval mall."
0,Fresh,"This is director Fincher's vision of the story. And, as Fincher has shown in films like ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac,"" that vision is often unflinching."
1,Rotten,"A tense storyline and a well-realised performance from Berry make Gothika a nice addition, but there's nothing that stands-out to make it anything more."
0,Fresh,"It's rare to find a flick that can be described as fascinating, boring, audacious, self-indulgent, frustrating, affecting, incoherent, engaging and maddening all in one breath. (Full Content Parental Review also available)"
0,Fresh,The Founder has its flaws - though not as many as its main subject - yet is an insightful look at the history of an iconic institution that doubles as a cautionary tale.
0,Fresh,"The show is Wright's, and he takes obvious and infectious relish in the goodies the books offer him."
0,Fresh,"Although lacking the bite and depth of his best work, Radio Days is one of Woody Allen's most purely entertaining pictures."
0,Fresh,"Superbad is a funny, boozy, ramshackle party, but it's more likely to leave audiences with a tingly afterglow than a pounding hangover."
0,Fresh,"Seal is not a likable guy exactly. He's actually kind of a greedy, amoral dirtbag. Which is why Liman and screenwriter Gary Spinelli need someone like Cruise to sell him. And sell him he does."
0,Fresh,A film that works as a thrilling adventure as exciting and visceral as any put on the screen in recent memory and as an intimate character piece about an ordinary man whose extraordinary courage allows him to persevere against seemingly insurmountable odd
1,Rotten,"It's just the same old fare: maybe a bit bigger and louder, with some impressive stunts, but still plagued by cliches, sloppy production, leaps of logic, bad acting and even worse dialogue."
0,Fresh,A slyly subversive film with a social point to make ...
0,Fresh,What is Method Man doing in Garden State?
1,Rotten,The movie is a zombie art picture. And nothing in it takes hold of us emotionally.
0,Fresh,"Defiantly progressive in its perception of love and creation that sees the two parties on an equal footing, Portrait of a Lady on Fire is as poignant as it is invigorating."
0,Fresh,"The eight independently produced vignettes, culled from Gibran's larger work and strung together by director Roger Allers to create a storyline where there was none, are an entertaining lot."
0,Fresh,Straight ahead in form but unnerving and unexpected in content.
1,Rotten,A date with Tim Burton isn't what it used to be; it hasn't been for a long time.
0,Fresh,"Martin Scorsese's Shine a Light, featuring the Rolling Stones onstage with their talented friends, rattled my old bones to nirvana and beyond as I searched for superlatives adequate to describe the rapturous vibes let loose by the performers."
0,Fresh,Offers a minor slice-of-life look at the dashed hopes of privileged youth.
0,Fresh,"He's never referred to as ""the Equalizer"" by those around him, but he might as well be, given that he's just a cape away from being a full-fledged superhero."
0,Fresh,"If you thought Black Swan made ballet look grim, this festival-fave documentary offers an earthier but no less griping portrait of the profession's crippling realities."
0,Fresh,"Unlike the herky-jerky 'Stepford Wives,' which can't decide if it's a big-screen 'Will & Grace' episode or a sci-fi fable, 'Dodgeball' is raucous fun from start to finish..."
1,Rotten,"Disappointing comedy that's let down by a lazy script, some truly dreadful CGI effects and a lack of decent laughs, though undemanding young children will probably enjoy it."
0,Fresh,"Evil Dead has ample cheap shocks and few bloodcurdling frights but it builds to something gorily bravura and, if that's your bag, you'll come away satisfied."
1,Rotten,"Son of Saul takes to give a different perspective from the days of Auschwitz, but the events unfold too slowly and feel too stagnant to be considered a film truly worth watching."
1,Rotten,"""Rebuilding Paradise"" is a movie that shows us a great deal without necessarily exploring what it shows."
0,Fresh,"Part sensual ghost story and part cautionary tale about profiteering from war, Ugetsu is a stunning film."
1,Rotten,Shares crucial DNA with the earlier films but is drawn from the shallower end of the gene pool.
0,Fresh,"Southland Tales resembles nothing less than a vintage Godard, with a brainstorm full of ideas roiling and lurching and looking for purchase."
0,Fresh,"An intimate venue coupled with incredibly energetic and heart-felt performances from Reed, the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and a string and brass section to die for make for a moving experience."
1,Rotten,"Would have been much funnier and much more natural with an R rating, especially when it comes to Cher's dialogue."
0,Fresh,This feels like a train at full speed. A thriller set in a cold and unforgiving place with no rules. [Full review in Spanish].
0,Fresh,"There are weak spots in the story, but it's such a fun story, and there's so much warmth in the characters' relationships with one another, that it hardly matters."
1,Rotten,"While this nouveau Fright Night does a reasonable job of maintaining the fun spirit of the original film, ... (it) never quite makes a convincing case for its own existence."
0,Fresh,The Great Santini is a convincing portrait of the battles between a military man and his coming-of-age son.
0,Fresh,"If you ask me, 2011 is really the year of the new sci-fi film, given this and two other terrific ""idea-based"" movies, The Adjustment Bureau and Limitless. And it's only April!"
1,Rotten,"How did Fincher - a director who is very good at supplying thrills to thrillers, whatever his other strengths or limitations might be - end up shepherding such a leaden film?"
0,Fresh,"Girls Trip is funny and consistently entertaining, with female-empowering sexual content that will take your breath away."
0,Fresh,"If Dreams with Sharp Teeth isn't as...well, sharp as it could be, it's still enormously enjoyable, particularly for sci-fi fans."
0,Fresh,Monsters vs. Aliens still packs a sufficient amount of jolting jocularity that is sure to satisfy the entertaining mindsets of youngsters and oldsters alike...a zesty escapist treat
1,Rotten,Somewhat of a self-fulfilling title.
0,Fresh,It's a mostly unspoken perversity of isolation and inherited violence that makes Halloween sing.
0,Fresh,"Certain Women, despite giving each of its stories a brief encapsulating coda, isn't merely open-ended-it seems to deny the very idea of narrative closure."
0,Fresh,"It tells an out-of-the-ordinary personal story and examines broad historical issues of societal memory and selective amnesia, of what is hidden between generations and what is revealed."
1,Rotten,No amount of nostalgia for Carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it.
0,Fresh,"Truman has been wronged, and it is thrilling to see him strive to escape a machine built by a compassionless and egomaniacal creator."
1,Rotten,"Hammering home its simplistic political messages as only Disney (and co-writer Damon Lindelof) can, director Bird's film has its moments, but mostly feels so yesterday."
0,Fresh,Lurches toward an offbeat honesty but it also very nearly crashes in its quirkiness.
0,Fresh,"It all adds up to a towering work, as profound as it is profane."
1,Rotten,A Puerto Rican drama that straddles the line between (tame) horror movie and (marginal) ghost story.
1,Rotten,"It's almost as though the filmmakers were trying to frustrate and annoy horror fans, and it's a hardy soul who will be willing to sit out the entire 123 minutes."
0,Fresh,"One of the very best, both for Bogart and Hepburn."
0,Fresh,"This is too scattershot to maintain its hilarity for anything more than a moment, and too mean-spirited to hold the attention beyond that laugh."
1,Rotten,"It isn't so much a movie about loving old video games and other cultural artifacts. It's about loving to love those things, which makes Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the bestselling novel feel hollow."
0,Fresh,How anyone can be in a bad mood after they watch this would be beyond me. A great cult classic!
1,Rotten,"The picture is cluttered and convoluted and big, and Marshall - taking over the reins from Gore Verbinski - doesn't seem to grasp how exhausting nonstop action can be."
1,Rotten,"Pulpy dross of surpassing dumbness, ""Charlie Countryman"" takes the blender approach to mixing dark adventure, doofus comedy and pie-eyed romance, but forgets to put the lid on when pulsed."
0,Fresh,"Hope Springs Eternal features the instantly likeable Mia Rose Frampton. The humor is a little broad, but the movie's messages will still resonate for a young audience."
0,Fresh,'Two hours of chocolate-coated pleasure.'
0,Fresh,"The unfocused yet still engaging documentary ""Shooting the Mafia"" is a compelling curiosity."
0,Fresh,"As the saying goes, you've got to shake 22 Bond films, before the 23rd is stirred to perfection. Without a doubt, this is the best James Bond movie."
1,Rotten,"I can understand why they wanted to do this movie, and I wish they'd been able to pull it off."
1,Rotten,"It doesn't really hold together as a movie, but if you're invested in It, you'll probably dig It Chapter Two, even though it's really long and a bit of a slog in places."
0,Fresh,"If there's any justice in the world of cinema, Wonderstruck will prove the type of unexpected, unhyped film for young adults that becomes a generational touchstone."
1,Rotten,"Great movies like ""ParaNorman"" and ""Frankenweenie"" showed the laughs you could get out of funny fiends; ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" just digs up a few corny gags."
1,Rotten,Pattinson's callowness and tendency to play rage as petulance don't help.
1,Rotten,"Ice Harvest has its laughs, but you may come out of the theater feeling like you need to take a shower."
1,Rotten,"The Anthony Jaswinski screenplay, besides giving the actors no characters whatsoever to play, is also overly familiar."
0,Fresh,As much a love story as a loving musical tribute to the mysterious man in black; a fine achievement in cinematic storytelling
0,Fresh,- a fun look at entertainment that hasn't left our generation
0,Fresh,"The only problem is that, with so much fascinating material to cover, The Crash Reel skips over half of it."
0,Fresh,An honest documentary about Trejo's life that'll leave its audience believing in second chances.
1,Rotten,"A blackly comic take on the first totally outsourced war? We're too close to being in one right now, which makes this John Cusack vehicle too close for comfort. It's also so close to being funny you can just about taste it -- just about."
0,Fresh,"The new movie is as moth-eaten as the serapes strewn through the 1960 film, but there's no denying the appeal of the image of Mr. Washington riding a horse, shooting a Colt and leading a posse of vigilantes to save a mostly white Western town."
0,Fresh,"What sets the movie apart is its caustic stripping down of the false academic, a satisfying approach that generates interest because of the egos on display, and because of the egos eventually bashed."
1,Rotten,"If you like Doug in 15-minute segments, you'll probably like him all right for 77 minutes."
0,Fresh,"It's fun watching them knock about together; not life-changing, but good for a few giggles. And isn't that what standup is about?"
1,Rotten,The only thing to take away from this bumpy ride is the smooth performance by Monaghan.
1,Rotten,"American Sniper never decides what it's about, besides reminding people of a great American hero, a proclamation that needs a case behind it."
1,Rotten,"Digressive rather than progressive, The Last Jedi fails to develop the new, exciting and complex characters we met in The Force Awakens."
1,Rotten,"The movie is so dutiful and tactful that it sometimes feels mechanical, constrained by its story rather than inspired by it."
1,Rotten,Basically a Rambo retread outfitted with a thin veneer of topical import.
0,Fresh,"As far as comedies go, I think [Wright's] movies are the best things out there."
0,Fresh,"Chuck and Larry remains something close to remarkable: an Adam Sandler movie that manages to be crude and caring in equal measure. In the multiplex, this is called progress."
1,Rotten,"Unfortunately, the movie's over-dependence on voice-over and its overwritten script interfere with the audience being able to fully engage."
1,Rotten,...a one-note comedy whose darker undertones are never fully explored.
1,Rotten,"What's on screen is too honest and from the heart to totally dismiss but too slick and contrived to completely embrace. This is a film that cares about genuine emotion but also wants to tame it, to tidy it up and keep it confined to quarters."
0,Fresh,"This freaky, nightmarish ride down Mulholland Drive thrilled me beyond rational explanation"
0,Fresh,"If you're a fan of 'extreme skiing' (ie. hurling yourself down terrifyingly steep terrain with sticks on your feet), this film is your Holy Grail."
0,Fresh,"Deep down, in the guts of the thing, the film's tone is as vicious as a junkyard dog, and just as mangy. Which is what great political satire is all about."
0,Fresh,"Such a far-fetched shaggy-dog yarn borders on the patronizing. But Gondry's belief in community-based, handmade, DIY culture is infectious, and his cry against big-box homogenization (fewer choices, more copies) is a noble one."
1,Rotten,"Since Bart's bloodlust is never matched in tenor by his righteousness, the story remains rife with unfulfilled moral inquiry."
1,Rotten,"If you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young TV actors (Dawson Leery did what?!?), or see some interesting storytelling devices, you might want to check it out, but there's nothing very attractive about this movie."
0,Fresh,"Chances are, we'll being seeing more indie films like Gillian Robespierre's Landline set in the pre-smartphone-and-social-media era."
0,Fresh,An exhilarating and heart-aching cinematic event.
0,Fresh,"The animation is great, especially among the minions, whose every action seems to instigate a ripple effect that creates a chain of slapstick laughs."
1,Rotten,Plays more like a collection of wild embellishments than a deeply satisfying movie.
0,Fresh,"As faithful as any 21st-century effort has come to matching the look and feel of a 1970's ""backwoods"" splatter flick...I smell a cult following in the making."
1,Rotten,I can't conceive of a more boring character to revolve your franchise around than Mitch Rapp.
1,Rotten,"Bludgeons you with cartoonish gags about stupid football players, irritable-bowel syndrome and (for the second Coen film in a row) somebody accidentally shooting himself in the head."
0,Fresh,"Another humorous entry in the Pixar collection, though their overall quality seems to be slipping."
1,Rotten,"It's definitely possible to make artful message movies -- just consider the filmography of ex-Mormon iconoclast Richard Dutcher -- but Forever Strong is generic faith-and-redemption fare, devoid of nuance."
1,Rotten,"The story, which feels like a disjointed collection of low-budget rock videos more than a coherent plot, just rocks idly on its pseudo-fashionable backside."
1,Rotten,"I still can't deny that parts of the film resonated with me, and down the road I might come to appreciate it more, but right now I feel mostly indifferent to what I saw."
1,Rotten,"In its noisy, pointless way, Street Fighter does come close to the frenetic meandering of a video game scenario -- which is precisely the problem."
0,Fresh,"A murder-happy slasher crowd-pleaser. Tense, gory, and full of nervous laughter, you can do much worse than spending 106 minutes with grim, loaded-for-bear Laurie Strode."
0,Fresh,"Cheadle is making his own work of art, as abstract as a Davis album at times, and the actor clearly establishes himself as a filmmaker with a confident visual style and narrative structure."
1,Rotten,"Ultimately, Relic has taken the A24-style horror to a point of lifeless inertia"
0,Fresh,Marc Maron shows surprising layers in this Southern-fried comedy that drops a lot of quips and pulls a few heartstrings.
1,Rotten,"Unbroken doesn't penetrate the surface of emotions, remaining a slightly detached, albeit respectful, representation of a potentially touching and inspiring true story."
0,Fresh,The filmmakers' purpose is social portraiture with a psychodynamic context.
0,Fresh,"It's got spunk and charm and two skillful stars in Bullock and Reynolds, who make it all feel much less generic than it is."
0,Fresh,"It may confound and even anger some viewers, but the Safdie brothers know what they're doing. They want their gripping story to put us between a rock and a hard place and make us squirm, just like their protagonist."
0,Fresh,"An entertaining, and occasionally horrifying, statement of the obvious."
0,Fresh,"Wildly ambitious, the result is totally gimmick free and possibly the most emotionally pulsating film you'll see all year."
0,Fresh,Rises above the pack in a few ways - ranging from its ambitious style to the out-of-whack humanity of its two lead performances.
1,Rotten,"Despite the occasional winning laugh line and beautiful animation, Meet the Robinsons is a disappointing outing for the Disney animation studios."
0,Fresh,"The scenes between teen Judy and studio head Louis B. Mayer are creepy and effective, and it well sets up the movie's corny but ultimately humanistic and effective ending."
0,Fresh,"Swale's film is not unlike the meals Alice serves Frank. She gives him an uncooked egg, a hard roll, and a paltry slice of ham on his first night. Eventually they enjoy a rasher of bacon, chips, and chocolate. ""Summerland"" is satisfying like comfort food."
1,Rotten,"Returning to the football field of The Waterboy, this time out Pop Warner quarterback Sandler just doesn't play to his strengths."
1,Rotten,"By trying to include everything, they accomplish nothing."
0,Fresh,Exudes untroubled mirth.
0,Fresh,"For a movie that traffics in the messiness of life, ""Bad Moms"" wraps up a little too tidily. Then again, maybe a happy ending is just what an audience full of exhausted moms deserves."
0,Fresh,"May not do anything radically new, but it offers enough twists on familiar territory to be worth a visit."
1,Rotten,"Instead of actually coming up with ideas that work, the filmmakers have decided to quickly barrel right over them in the hopes that the audience won't notice."
0,Fresh,"Projected on a towering IMAX screen, the docudrama's aggressive use of close-ups creates a suffocating and scorching effect."
0,Fresh,Call Me Kuchu leaves you flabbergasted by its portrait of the persecution of gay men and lesbians in Uganda.
1,Rotten,"A mix of top-notch voice talents, standard computer animation and several missed story opportunities."
0,Fresh,"Not a keeper like 'Frozen', but a loveable and giddy guilty pleasure."
0,Fresh,"It all works extremely well, with the exception of the ugly hand-held cinematography designed to make the war footage look more chaotic but that really only looks jerky."
0,Fresh,Solid Hitchcock espionage whirlwind.
1,Rotten,This curiously depressing remake of Miracle on 34th Street epitomizes contemporary Hollywood's inability to bring style and originality to the kind of family comedies it once produced with aplomb.
0,Fresh,"As a combination survival and action film, 'First Blood' delivers enough excitement to please fans of this sort of thing, although it must settle logically for a less than wholly satisfying ending."
0,Fresh,"Once you settle into Keanu, it works. And in many ways, it's of a piece with everything else Key and Peele have done."
1,Rotten,An unappealing big city neo-noir film.
1,Rotten,"Although The Laundromat intents to simplify the story of the scandal that shook the world, its disjointed vignettes and characters make it way more convoluted. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0,Fresh,"The special effects are exceptional, as are the stunts. There is no point at which the action lags. Despite a weak script, it's fun; the opening tracking shot is worth the price of admission, when you realize there's no ship there."
0,Fresh,"It's a bravura, artful work."
0,Fresh,Endearing little film.
0,Fresh,"How does Lyne's Lolita compare with Stanley Kubrick's, back in 1962? It's superior in balance."
0,Fresh,"Cassavetes, first and foremost, made Alpha Dog a great ensemble piece, a decision that really distinguishes the film from its lesser teenage crime counterparts."
0,Fresh,"Rampling and Courtenay don't even have to raise their voices to command attention. It's all nuance, in their eyes and subtle body movements and in their micro snippets of dialogue."
1,Rotten,"If Netflix is serious about becoming a major player in the original-movies game, they're going to have to do better than True Memoirs of an International Assassin."
1,Rotten,"The movie isn't as much fun as I was hoping for -- it's downbeat and hopeless in tone, like an action-movie King Lear without the poetry. Stallone's performance feels halfhearted; it doesn't have the exuberance of which he's capable."
0,Fresh,"Honda may not have created the most convincing-looking monster in cinema history, but he managed to give his sci-fi/horror movie a social relevance, particularly in postwar Japan."
0,Fresh,"No new ground is dug up in Good Boy, but the story is well-paced, sweet and lively, filling a void for very young filmgoers."
0,Fresh,After a slow start the movie gets better and better as it goes along
0,Fresh,A rough-hewn but sometimes very funny sort of performance diary.
0,Fresh,"In this film there is little to [Steve Jobs] but conflict, and that can be somewhat tiresome to watch."
0,Fresh,"If there were the slightest justice and curiosity in the Academy Award process, Thornton's work here would get a nomination."
1,Rotten,"For the most part, the movie is too busy with its ungainly, underwhelming plotting to be even stupidly fun."
0,Fresh,"What's singular in all this is the director's angle into the material, which is subtle, difficult to pin down, elusive."
0,Fresh,"[VIDEO ESSAY] If you've seen its trailer, you know the whole story for ""Southless."" Nonetheless, witnessing Gyllenhaal's ever-bloodied boxing monster come to life is worth the price of admission."
0,Fresh,"The brightest spot belongs to Angelina Jolie, who is so compelling to watch she has chemistry with the furniture."
1,Rotten,Ends abruptly and without satisfaction.
1,Rotten,Maybe Scoop wouldn't have sunk if Woody the costar were thrown overboard.... What once was a gifted comic's fluid improvisation is now a doddering old man so embarrassing he's uncomfortable to watch.
1,Rotten,The fighting and chasing - exciting though they are - are surrounded by a second rate movie.
0,Fresh,"Certain Women burns slow, but it leaves behind a mysterious, shimmering aura. You feel you know these women-even if their feelings are at times elusive even to themselves."
0,Fresh,"The first ""Maze Runner"" film was a wilderness saga refitted with robotic monsters. ""The Scorch Trials"" is a ""Mad Max"" film on foot."
0,Fresh,"A dazzling, dizzying documentary about nothing less than whether we exist in a coherent universe of ordered, even beautiful laws ..."
1,Rotten,The film follows a Hollywood marketing plan more than any personal vision and couches ideas in timeworn platitudes. It's illogical and emotionally unsatisfying.
1,Rotten,"Sincere, square, and interminable."
1,Rotten,"What is most striking about The Spirit is how little pleasure it affords, in spite of its efforts to by sly, sexy, heartfelt and clever all at once."
0,Fresh,A persuasive piece of propaganda because it is as entertaining and funny as it is heart-rending and disturbing.
0,Fresh,Its sparkling cast and a few inventive riffs on an old outline make this a welcome holiday entertainment.
0,Fresh,"Here is Costner, calm and careful, his skin these days only a little older with its new indentations and fine markings. And when he is like this on screen, he is perfect."
1,Rotten,"Despite the affecting performances by the two leads, this overly muted drama fails to make much of an impact."
1,Rotten,"[Jeff] Nichols's tale has no real urgency, and as a result, Loving feels vacant."
1,Rotten,"Nothing in this movie would actually happen, so what's irritating is that it presents itself as a savvy, ""Am I right, ladies?"" dating commentary."
1,Rotten,"Radioflash is a film at war with its own ideas, its central themes in conflict with one another and its plot spiralling out in complexity as film progresses."
1,Rotten,"A raunchy comedy that plays like a Superbad without the smarts, the heart, the originality or the laughs."
0,Fresh,"Yes, the apes are very, very cool. The costumes, the sets, the makeup, the stunts, the music and the special effects: cool, cool, cool."
0,Fresh,"There's plenty to cheer about and nothing really to reflect upon or celebrate. Save for the fact that, Bay had good intentions while making this movie based on real events."
0,Fresh,A lively celebration of a woman who can legitimately claim to have changed the world.
1,Rotten,"The story is familiar, the screenplay never explains the demons that drove Joe Albany to trash his talent, and the life of a reckless junkie eventually grows tedious."
1,Rotten,Would have worked brilliantly as a five-minute late-night comedy sketch.
0,Fresh,"Always engaging, if overlong, formulaic and anti-climactic."
1,Rotten,"On the whole, St. Vincent is a jumble of twee, American independent film clichés that felt finished by the time Garden State left theaters."
0,Fresh,A knockout new thriller by John Woo.
0,Fresh,"Conveys the confusion of real life roles that women are pressured to play out in society to please others, and in contradiction with their own natural desires."
0,Fresh,Burton has produced a timeless classic.
1,Rotten,"[It] isn't Statham's best - or most brutal - work, but it's not bad."
0,Fresh,"One of the most distinctive, entertaining and flat-out fun movies I've seen in a long time, a great piece of holiday family filmmaking that doesn't insult the intelligence."
0,Fresh,"The Normal Heart...offers a stinging political indictment of the shameful attitudes toward gay men's health in the 1980s and a touching evocation of the human losses suffered due to HIV-AIDS. And the film boasts winning, Emmy-bait performances all around."
1,Rotten,Never comes to an emotional boil.
0,Fresh,"Rust Creek just wants to tell a lean, mean, and razor sharp story, which they do, without question."
1,Rotten,...[an] ambitious but sappy saga...the redemptive vibes are unevenly at work in this tepid tale of sin and salvation.
0,Fresh,"Taking sure aim at the abomination of the formula rom-com, (Schumer) satirizes not just the genre, but the state of contemporary single-hood."
1,Rotten,"Despite its wild dreams, it becomes just another rusty piece of animated machinery, going through the motions somewhat mechanically."
0,Fresh,"Even with its irritating ending, there's something so relatable about Marco that makes the story go, well, somewhere"
0,Fresh,"If you're a fan, you'll already know that spending time with these two hilarious guys is a perfectly fine alternative for being able to go on trips yourself."
1,Rotten,"It has a respect for the cultures it observes, and a nice sense of place. But it has no compelling character. It might have in real life. But on the screen she's as diluted as the drugs she helps to sell."
0,Fresh,A rather remarkable sequel.
0,Fresh,"Very personal docu explores gay stereotypes, self discovery."
1,Rotten,The puzzles in this movie and the infinite number of sequels which have already been queued behind it have been designed to tear the dead presidents from your wallet like a sobriety chip from the shaky palm of Lindsay Lohan.
0,Fresh,"Synthesizing Aronofsky's previous work and foregrounding a breakthrough star performance from Natalie Portman as its tormented protagonist, this is a marvelous construction that's in line for multiple Oscar nominations..."
1,Rotten,"Leigh's sympathy for the working poor is unmistakable and unassailable, but the tragic grandeur with which he imbues their pain hovers dangerously close to condescension."
0,Fresh,"It's all kid stuff, but good fun, and over in a snappy 94 minutes."
0,Fresh,Imagine Waiting for Godot performed by The Breakfast Club.
1,Rotten,"Australia is so damnably eager to please that it feels like being pinned down by a giant overfriendly dingo and having your face licked for about three hours: theoretically endearing but, honestly, kind of gross."
1,Rotten,"... it probably cost less than the catering budget of average Adam Sandler comedy and, in its own hit-and-miss scattershot fashion, it's about as funny. At least when it hits."
1,Rotten,"For a movie called ""Monte Carlo,"" this one keeps the stakes pretty low."
1,Rotten,... the twists within twists become so laughable that you can't take anything seriously... the only thing missing here is a laugh track.
0,Fresh,Think a female Michael Clayton. It's Michelle Clayton.
0,Fresh,"Dark and heavenly, sardonic and touching, the film melodically navigates its every narrative turn and tonal shift with the same grace afforded to its gloriously shrewd music and lyrics."
0,Fresh,"Cake is mostly a melancholy, tragically stunning film, with a groundbreaking performance by Aniston and enough biting humor and heart to create the perfect balance it needs to make a lasting impression."
1,Rotten,"More useless than bad, the type of thing that will divert your attention for an hour and a half but nothing more."
1,Rotten,"Operates less as a sequel and more as an audience-friendly corrective with franchise potential (""Let's remake Sicario - but more fun!"")."
0,Fresh,Fey's script balances acid humor and a sweet understanding that the viciousness of high school is good preparation for life.
0,Fresh,"Unconventional and mysterious, ""Us"" takes viewers on a bloody and murderous ride through the eyes of the survivors. And Peele smartly makes us survivors all, condemning us, like the WIlsons, to grapple with all the nagging questions."
0,Fresh,"Won't win any awards for originality, but it carries the familiar adventure along efficiently, generating sufficient excitement to keep one from dreading the next chapter."
0,Fresh,Brothers isn't your standard PTSD yarn.
0,Fresh,"Inside the Rain can't help but be a brave piece of filmmaking. But you might not expect it to be as funny as it is. And above all, you may well be caught off-guard by its frequent moments of visual beauty."
0,Fresh,There is a lot to like about this daring drama but the final act pushes the suspension of disbelief to the extreme.
1,Rotten,"Written using ""20 Master Plots (And How to Build Them)"" with an Adam Sandler declaration-of-love-in-a-stadium ending."

0,Fresh,Does Mean Girls screenwriter Tina Fey want to throw George W. Bush under the wheels of a bus?
0,Fresh,What Now You See Me 2 lacks in prestige it makes up for in showmanship.
0,Fresh,"The most urgent movie of 2016, which seems a strange thing to say about a movie written in the 1980s, predominately about the 1960s. But here we are."
0,Fresh,This is a cult book from yesterday that makes a popular film for today...
0,Fresh,"If you can get past the giant pumpkin in the ballroom - really, why bother to remake Cinderella in 2015 if you have no new spin on the material? - there's a lot to like about director Kenneth Branagh's gorgeously fanciful tale."
0,Fresh,"Anchored by Foy's captivating performance, the movie overcomes some notable flaws to suggest there's plenty of promise in this take on Salander."
1,Rotten,"Unengaging maritime thriller from Ridley Scott. Good cast, but fails to connect."
0,Fresh,An astounding drama that's still a contender almost 50 years on.
0,Fresh,An undemandingly agreeable trifle that should satisfy anyone in search of an old-fashioned Cinderella story at the megaplex.
1,Rotten,"""The Happytime Murders"" is a one-joke movie, - one joke."
1,Rotten,"This entry is an alternately goofy and vicious spy movie, and that's it."
0,Fresh,A brilliantly atmospheric film with a superb performance by Loden.
0,Fresh,Ben X boldly melds virtual reality with live-action vrit style and docudrama to create what may be a new film grammar.
1,Rotten,"Spiers' pseudo-documentary bubble-and-squeak allows the girls to dress up, dress down, change identities, ride around in a Union Jack bus, rub shoulders with a large cameo cast, and indulge in vacuous banter. Help!"
0,Fresh,"Marc Forster seems like a counterintuitive choice to direct an action spectacle. But any doubts I might have had flew out the window and splattered onto the hood of a parked car during an early, hellacious brawl."
0,Fresh,"We pass through the eye of the needle and learn how the world works, for better or worse."
1,Rotten,"The cast is impressive - Julie Christie, Jenny Agutter, David Tennant, Hugh Bonneville, Christopher Lee - though more astonishing is why any of them were tempted into such tosh."
1,Rotten,An underfunded inventor makes enough snide asides about 'relentlessly unfashionable android technology' that you half expect Williams to start speechifying about the merits of cloning.
0,Fresh,"The music rocks, the performances are fun."
1,Rotten,"Fortunately for this sentimental coming-of-age story based on the young-adult novel by Ann Brashares and directed by Ken Kwapis, its target audience is youthful enough that the cliches may still retain a hint of freshness."
0,Fresh,"Seattle is overrun with record-company executives, and with journalists eager to over-analyze the most banal details of grunge culture. Can any form of music survive this process?"
1,Rotten,"Call me crazy or overly conservative, but I find it completely reprehensible to have another child simply to use as an organ and tissue farm for another kid."
0,Fresh,Gruesome and dark as it can be. But could I stop watching? Not me!
0,Fresh,"As they land this fish-out-of-water story, Spielberg and Hanks have created a modern Catch-22 that moves you to laughter and then tugs your heart moments later."
0,Fresh,"Like much of Hardy, its drama is forced and manipulative ... but -- thanks to luminous frames from cinematographer Alwin Kuchler -- it's as rich as some of the author's most sensuous passages."
0,Fresh,"It's all pretty inane if you stop to think about it, but director Joe Turteltaub works tirelessly to make sure we don't."
